23/1/24, 2:52 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: We were overwhelmed and had to reject more applications because of limited seats, however were surely intrigued to know the reasons for such an immediate upsurge.  Having Conversations with my other students who are already preparing to arrive in India under the Edoofa Scholarship shared some mind-boggling Screenshots from the Fee Prospectus of the Universities in Zimbabwe.

23/1/24, 2:55 PM - +27 73 417 1131: Okay
23/1/24, 2:56 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: I am shocked to compile these data for Fee Structures of some famous Public Universities of Zimbabwe.

*Bindura University of Science Education (BUSE)* -https://www.buse.ac.zw/fees-structure/ - *($680 per term)*

*Chinhoyi University of Technology (CUT)* https://www.cut.ac.zw/welcome/assets/files/fees-structure/School%20of%20Engineering%20Science.pdf - *($535 per term)*

*University of Zimbabwe (UZ)* -https://www.uz.ac.zw/index.php/faculties/160-fac-of-medicine/med-deparrtments/305-med-dpt-of-comm *($523 per term)*

NUST -*($870 per term)*
23/1/24, 2:56 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: *I am sure you and your family must have also discussed this,*. So what have you decided for your future ahead?

23/1/24, 3:04 PM - +27 73 417 1131: We have not yet come up with the final decision but we have decided to apply both abroad and in local schools. But I want to pursue my education abroad at affordable schools.but if the prices are too high I will go to universities this side
23/1/24, 3:09 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Dephine, Let me help you understand the same in much more detail
23/1/24, 3:09 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: While the cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, the cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal which is Sadza and curry costs a student $1 one time and you are aware of this better. The cost of *Accommodation, Food, Wifi, stationery, gadgets, transport* etc is an additional expense for a student. The initial registration fee for the Zimbabwean Universities ranges from *$20-$75 without the guarantee of being eligible or not.* The *attachment fee before graduation ranges from $200 or more.*
23/1/24, 3:10 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Let me tell you, I was caught in surprise when I compared it with the Edoofa Scholarship Program, not because of affordability but the opportunity to acquire skills, knowledge and be employable. Speaking about Employability, do you feel Zimbabwe is ready to equip the graduates with job opportunities in their aspired fields?
23/1/24, 6:56 PM - +27 73 417 1131: I don't think so
23/1/24, 7:27 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: I was expecting your response, but it seems you were occupied at that moment, so I will have to schedule your session for *tomorrow at 09:30 AM CAT* as my working hours are over for the day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.
23/1/24, 7:28 PM - +27 73 417 1131: Okay sir
24/1/24, 8:05 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Good Morning Everyone,

24/1/24, 8:24 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Being a senior academican and counsellor, my aspirations for young learners like you are similar. I firmly believe higher education should combine the following for a learner to achieve their goals:-

*Personalized mentorship and guidance throughout your course:* As your Career Counsellor, I have known you since the beginning of the process, understanding your interests, aspirations, family background and plans for your career, unlike a University officer who may come across your application for the first time and treats with the same importance like others. I personally understand where you come from and what is required for you to be successful.
24/1/24, 8:36 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
24/1/24, 8:36 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: 3. *Financial Support and Planning:* With a flexible payment plan for registration fees spreading across 45 days, the remaining cost of education can be paid in two installments.

*“Education is the key to unlocking the world. It is the passport to freedom.” ---- Oprah Winfrey*

With all positive energy, I am here to continue our interactive session.
29/1/24, 8:22 AM - +27 73 417 1131: Good morning how are you
29/1/24, 8:26 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: I am doing great please
29/1/24, 8:26 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: So before proceeding with the session, are there any questions you would like to ask?
29/1/24, 9:58 AM - +27 73 417 1131: So far no questions
29/1/24, 10:36 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: As I have promised, the Edoofa Admissions team will be submitting your application to multiple universities that will evaluate your application and upon being eligible, you receive the offer letters with comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. *I will guide you to the best education institution/university associated with us that aligns with your vision and interest and would provide you with a conducive environment for your holistic development and to fulfil your career goals.*
29/1/24, 10:36 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Upon receiving the Offer Letter, you will have a few weeks to pay a portion of your university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. We discussed the registration fee during our counselling sessions. May I know, what do you recall about the same now?
29/1/24, 10:48 AM - +27 73 417 1131: The registration fee was $750
29/1/24, 10:49 AM - +27 73 417 1131: But since we paid 350 we will now be paying the remaining balance
29/1/24, 10:50 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Dephine, Earlier you paid the $350 Enrollment fees I believe?
29/1/24, 10:50 AM - +27 73 417 1131: Yes sir
29/1/24, 11:14 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Dephine, please the Edoofa Enrollment fees and the university enrollment fees are completely different things
29/1/24, 11:20 AM - +27 73 417 1131: Okay I understand
29/1/24, 11:54 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Let me help you with a better understanding. *Usually, the registration fee is an additional fee apart from the cost of education but Edoofians receive an exclusive benefit where it is a part of the cost of education itself.* Let me give you an example:-
29/1/24, 11:55 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: As we discussed in the counselling session, the cost of education in India ranges from $6000-$8000 per annum which is reduced to $2000-$3000 per annum through the Edoofa Scholarship Program which includes the registration fee, remaining tuition fees, Accommodation, Food, Wifi, Laundry, library fee etc. Now, let us assume,

1. *Tuition Fee*: $1800 per annum
2. *Food and Accommodation Fee*: $1000 per annum 
Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum
3. *Registration Fee to be paid:* $1000
29/1/24, 11:55 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: This means this registration fee that you pay will be subtracted from the cost of education ($2800-$1000= $1800) and the remaining fee of $1800 can be paid in two installments. The first part of $900 within 3 days after your arrival here in India and the remaining $900 will be due in December 2024, or before your second semester begins.

*Do you have any questions for me regarding the same?*
29/1/24, 11:59 AM - +27 73 417 1131: I understand.i have no questions
29/1/24, 11:59 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: The registration fee can be paid either in two equal parts(The first half within 15 days and the second half within 30 days) or in one go itself.

Are you clear with the details?
29/1/24, 12:00 PM - +27 73 417 1131: Yes sir
29/1/24, 12:04 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: So Dephine, are your parents available for the session?

29/1/24, 4:11 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Duly noted Please
29/1/24, 4:15 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: I understand that you are interested in this golden opportunity to study in India under the given Scholarship. I do realize that your Family Members may have other concerns and this is the reason I have requested our Program Director Mr. Abhinav to spare some time to talk to your Parents about this. I hope you recall that he was the one to Interview you and had a Video Call earlier.

*So I request the parents to be active for this interactive video call session with the Program Director* so that he can financially assist you and plan your child's higher education on Priority.

*Your video call session is scheduled for 11:00 AM CAT tomorrow*
29/1/24, 4:22 PM - +27 73 417 1131: Okay thank you sir

30/1/24, 8:32 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Good morning!  let's draw inspiration from the timeless wisdom found in the Bible:

*"As the scriptures teach, knowledge is a steadfast companion. A person enlightened by wisdom is held in high regard across all realms. The brilliance of education surpasses the allure of beauty and the vigor of youth."*
