24/1/24, 9:01 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Good Day, Dear parent and Bupe
*I am Mr Shubham, Senior Academician at Edoofa*
I hope you all are doing well

If you recall, I hosted your counselling and evaluation sessions, and you made me proud by qualifying for our prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program. I received results from all my students, happy and exhilarating with joy. Recalling our interaction together after a frantic search for your name I ended up messaging you today. I understand your calibre and had a discussion with the Admissions Head and have decided to *personally look after your admission process so that we can proceed with your application on priority through the best possible opportunities and exposures.*

Hence I request you to come online at the earliest and notify me so that I can guide you ahead. <This message was edited>

24/1/24, 9:37 AM - +260 95 4583351: Hi Mr. Shubham,
24/1/24, 9:41 AM - +260 95 4583351: Thank you for reaching out to us. We've agreed as a family as indicated on other fora that Bupe will pursue her first degree locally. We therefore are not proceeding with the admission processes. Greatly appreciate your reaching out to us regarding the same. Have a lovely day  & best regards.
24/1/24, 9:50 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Hello Mr Koyi,
Can you help me understand the reason for the same, I still remember Bupe was passionate about pursuing an education abroad, along with career and goals, making him one of my favourite students.

May I know, what exactly happened due to which you weren't able to proceed?
24/1/24, 9:58 AM - +260 95 4583351: Bupe is eligible for tuition waiver at Copperbelt University were the mother is a member of staff. This entails no payment of fees for her University Education hence the reason for not pursuing with the admission process.
24/1/24, 10:57 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: I totally understand the same, and has Bupe begun his lessons at the university?
24/1/24, 11:31 AM - +260 95 4583351: Not yet, she's still waiting for her grade twelve results.
24/1/24, 2:49 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: I understand Mr Koyi
24/1/24, 2:51 PM - +260 95 4583351: Thank you. Appreciate your reaching out to us.
