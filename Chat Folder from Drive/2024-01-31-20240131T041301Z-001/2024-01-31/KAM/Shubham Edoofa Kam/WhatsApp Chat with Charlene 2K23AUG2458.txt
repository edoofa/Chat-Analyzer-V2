16/1/24, 12:17 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Charlene

I trust this message finds you well, and I hope you are in high spirits. In recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their A-Level results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey.
16/1/24, 12:17 PM - Ashi Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?
16/1/24, 8:07 PM - +263 78 517 8501: I am well thank you.
How are you ?
16/1/24, 8:10 PM - +263 78 517 8501: <Media omitted>
16/1/24, 9:24 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your results, and congratulations on successfully clearing all your A-Level subjects! Your hard work over the past few months has truly paid off.

I am sure your family is immensely proud of your achievements. Your A-level results have been duly noted, and we will quickly add them to your scholarship application. This will enable us to engage in discussions with the academic board and chart the best course of action for your next steps.
16/1/24, 9:25 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Kindly allow us time till Monday to thoroughly evaluate your results and plan the way forward. Once we have re-evaluated your application, along with all the other applications, Mr. Shubham, the senior career counselor at Edoofa will connect with you to guide you on the next steps in your academic career.
16/1/24, 9:43 PM - +263 78 517 8501: Sure they are very proud of me and lm happy too that all my toil did not go to waste
16/1/24, 9:43 PM - +263 78 517 8501: Okay noted with thanks
22/1/24, 9:48 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Good Day, Charlene
*I am Mr Shubham, Senior Career Counsellor at Edoofa*
I hope you all are doing well

If you recall, I hosted your counselling and evaluation sessions, and you made me proud by qualifying for our prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program. I received results from all my students, happy and exhilarating with joy. 
Recalling our interaction after a frantic search for your name I ended up messaging you today.

22/1/24, 2:22 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: So Charlene, I can see that earlier you failed to complete your admissions process, Can you help me understand the reason fro the same, so that I can assist you accordingly?
22/1/24, 2:35 PM - +263 78 517 8501: It was because my mother fell sick and could not concentrate on anything else. She failed to pay for the admission process as she paid off her Medical billd
22/1/24, 3:11 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: I totally understand that, I hope she is doing better now?

23/1/24, 9:32 AM - +263 78 517 8501: Ooh really ,amazing!!
23/1/24, 9:54 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: We were overwhelmed and had to reject more applications because of limited seats, however were surely intrigued to know the reasons for such an immediate upsurge.  Having Conversations with my other students who are already preparing to arrive in India under the Edoofa Scholarship shared some mind-boggling Screenshots from the Fee Prospectus of the Universities in Zimbabwe.

23/1/24, 11:33 AM - +263 78 517 8501: Yes we have discussed this.For my future ahead we discussed for abroad education rather than here in Zimbabwe.
23/1/24, 11:33 AM - +263 78 517 8501: We chose India ,of course.
23/1/24, 12:32 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: That is absolutely understandable and thank you for sharing. Being a career counsellor, my aspirations for young learners like you are similar. I firmly believe higher education should combine the following for a learner to achieve their goals:-

Quality Education
Conducive Environment
Critical Thinking and Practical learning skills
Technological Literacy and Attachments
Cultural Awareness and Global Perspective
Career guidance, Mentorships, etc.

*However, not everyone achieves success. Do you know why*?
23/1/24, 12:52 PM - +263 78 517 8501: Yes
23/1/24, 1:39 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>

24/1/24, 10:10 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: I see you are quite a visionary and we will work together to make the right decision for your career. It is important to know why the Edoofa guidance will be unique compared to the normal University approach.
24/1/24, 10:11 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: *Personalized mentorship and guidance throughout your course:* As your Career Counsellor, I have known you since the beginning of the process, understanding your interests, aspirations, family background and plans for your career, unlike a University officer who may come across your application for the first time and treats with the same importance like others. I personally understand where you come from and what is required for you to be successful.
24/1/24, 10:11 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
24/1/24, 10:11 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: *Financial Support and Planning:* With a flexible payment plan for registration fees spreading across 45 days, the remaining cost of education can be paid in two installments. Students are ensured to open Indian bank accounts so that parents can even deposit the fees in monthly installments.

Do You know?  *The following Students from your Makumbe Mission High School are already here in India and some of them are preparing to arrive this year.* I understand that we all have challenges in life and as your Career Counselor I am empathetic to helping you achieve the best of opportunities there are out there for you to be offered
24/1/24, 12:49 PM - +263 78 517 8501: This is great news!It will be nice of you helping me through out the process
24/1/24, 1:41 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Perfect, To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is B.Sc (Medical Lab Technology) and your intake is in August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information is accurate?
24/1/24, 1:44 PM - +263 78 517 8501: Yes it is true .
24/1/24, 2:31 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: As I have promised, the Edoofa Admissions team will be submitting your application to multiple universities that will evaluate your application and upon being eligible, you receive the offer letters with comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. *I will guide you to the best education institution/university associated with us that aligns with your vision and interest and would provide you with a conducive environment for your holistic development and to fulfil your career goals.*
24/1/24, 2:31 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Upon receiving the Offer Letter, you will have a few weeks to pay a portion of your university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. We discussed the registration fee during our counselling sessions. May I know, what do you recall about the same now?
24/1/24, 3:32 PM - +263 78 517 8501: Sure ,noted!
24/1/24, 3:33 PM - +263 78 517 8501: I recall that the registration fee is paid in order to secure a scholarship seat at a certain university.
24/1/24, 5:12 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: As we discussed in the counseling session, the cost of education in India ranges from $6000-$8000 per annum which is reduced to $1200-$1800 per annum through the Edoofa Scholarship Program *as we recommended your application for a higher quantum of scholarship.* Congratulations on securing the same. Now, let us assume,
24/1/24, 5:13 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: 1. *Tuition Fee*: $650 per annum
2. *Accommodation Fee*: $0 per annum (100% Sponsorship)
3. *Remaining Fee Components*: [Library Fee, Examination Fee, EDB and Book Bank, International Student Development Fund, 24-Hour WiFi Cost, Maintenance Fee, Water Bill, and Electricity Bill]: $1000 per annum
24/1/24, 5:13 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: *Total Fee: Tuition Fee $650 + Accommodation Fee $0 + Remaining Fee Components $1000 = $1650 per annum.*
24/1/24, 5:13 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: *Registration Fee to be paid:* $1000 

This means this registration fee will be waived off from the cost of education ($1650-$1000= $650) and this remaining fee of $650 is supposed to be paid within 3 days of arrival.

*Do you have any questions for me regarding the same?*
24/1/24, 5:55 PM - +263 78 517 8501: When is the registration fee of $1000 paid?
24/1/24, 7:01 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: The registration fee can be paid either in two equal parts(The first half within 15 days and the second half within 30 days) or in one go itself.

Are you clear with the details?

25/1/24, 9:45 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: So Charlene, Why would you like to change your course please?
25/1/24, 10:09 AM - +263 78 517 8501: Considering my A level results ,l found it necessary to go for something much recognised here in Zimbabwe not knowing the rank at that side .
25/1/24, 11:22 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: So which course would your like too pursue your degree in?
25/1/24, 4:25 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>

With all positive energy, I am here to continue our interactive session.
29/1/24, 9:00 AM - +263 78 517 8501: Good morning!
29/1/24, 10:13 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Being a senior academician and counsellor, my aspirations for young learners like you are similar. I firmly believe higher education should combine the following for a learner to achieve their goals:-

Quality Education
Conducive Environment
Critical Thinking and Practical learning skills
Technological Literacy and Attachments
Cultural Awareness and Global Perspective
Career guidance, Mentorships, etc.

*However, not everyone achieves success. Do you know why*?
29/1/24, 10:21 AM - +263 78 517 8501: Yes!
29/1/24, 11:05 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: That's great, So please share your understanding Charlene
29/1/24, 2:00 PM - +263 78 517 8501: Most people fail to achieve success due to lack of persistence. They quit.
29/1/24, 2:24 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: So Charlene Why do you want to change your course?
29/1/24, 2:58 PM - +263 78 517 8501: I have always wanted to work with patients and so considering my A level results ,l found a great possibility to belong to a group of doctors since l was of no luck for medicine in India.
29/1/24, 3:15 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Charlene, if you would have researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which the Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A-Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*. whereas if they want to study any Engineering Course then they should have *Physics, Chemistry and Maths* in their A level mandatorily.
29/1/24, 4:50 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: I have noted all your responses for the day, Since my working hours for the day are over now, *I have therefore scheduled your session for 09:30 AM CAT tomorrow*

God Bless you,
Have a great day ahead!
29/1/24, 5:46 PM - +263 78 517 8501: Yes and that is the reason why l could not go for medicine
30/1/24, 8:32 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Good morning!  let's draw inspiration from the timeless wisdom found in the Bible:

*"As the scriptures teach, knowledge is a steadfast companion. A person enlightened by wisdom is held in high regard across all realms. The brilliance of education surpasses the allure of beauty and the vigor of youth."*

May our journey of learning be guided by the profound teachings that echo through the ages. With positive energy, let's continue our interactive session and embrace the transformative power of education.
30/1/24, 9:25 AM - +263 78 517 8501: Morning!
Thank you!
30/1/24, 10:13 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: So before proceeding with the session, are there any questions you would like to ask?
30/1/24, 10:51 AM - +263 78 517 8501: No questions sir.
30/1/24, 11:43 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: If a student does not have the required subjects to study medicine in India, there are alternative options available in the field of healthcare. Pursuing a degree in Medical Laboratory Technology or Cardiovascular Technology can be a viable route to eventually pursuing a major in medicine.
30/1/24, 11:43 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Medical Laboratory Technology involves the analysis of body fluids and tissues to diagnose diseases and aid in treatment. It requires a strong foundation in science and mathematics and offers courses in biochemistry, microbiology, haematology, and immunology, among others. Students with a degree in Medical Laboratory Technology can work in labs, hospitals, and clinics, and can gain valuable experience in the field of medicine.
30/1/24, 11:43 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Cardiovascular Technology involves the use of non-invasive procedures to diagnose and treat heart and blood vessel disorders. This field requires a strong foundation in biology and anatomy and offers courses in electrocardiography, echocardiography, and vascular technology. Students with a degree in Cardiovascular Technology can work in hospitals and clinics and can gain valuable experience in the field of cardiology.
30/1/24, 11:43 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Both Medical Laboratory Technology and Cardiovascular Technology can provide students with a solid foundation in the healthcare field and valuable experience in the medical industry. Pursuing a major in medicine after obtaining a degree in one of these fields is possible, and students can gain an advantage over their peers by having a more diverse skill set and experience in the field. It is important for parents to encourage their children to explore alternative options in the field of healthcare if they are unable to pursue a major in medicine initially.
30/1/24, 11:50 AM - +263 78 517 8501: Noted with thanks!
30/1/24, 12:43 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: So Would you like to continue with your your course?
30/1/24, 1:15 PM - +263 78 517 8501: Yes l would like to!
30/1/24, 1:31 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Duly noted
30/1/24, 1:32 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: So Charlene, Are your parents available for the session right now?
30/1/24, 3:31 PM - +263 78 517 8501: No they are not available
30/1/24, 3:34 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: May I know by when will they be available?
30/1/24, 4:26 PM - +263 78 517 8501: She is now available
30/1/24, 4:53 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: May I know by when will they be available?
