16/1/24, 12:16 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Diana

I trust this message finds you well, and I hope you are in high spirits. In recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their A-Level results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey.
16/1/24, 12:16 PM - Ashi Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?

*I am Mr Shubham, Senior Acadmecian at Edoofa*
I hope you all are doing well

If you recall, I hosted your counselling and evaluation sessions, and you made me proud by qualifying for our prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program. I received results from all my students, happy and exhilarating with joy. Recalling our interaction together after a frantic search for your name I ended up messaging you today. I understand your calibre and had a discussion with the Admissions Head and have decided to *personally look after your admission process so that we can proceed with your application on priority through the best possible opportunities and exposures.*

Hence I request you to come online at the earliest and notify me so that I can guide you ahead.
