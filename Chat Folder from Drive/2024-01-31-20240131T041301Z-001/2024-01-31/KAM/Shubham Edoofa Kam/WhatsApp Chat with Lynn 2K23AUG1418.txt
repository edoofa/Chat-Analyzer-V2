16/1/24, 12:13 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Lynn

I trust this message finds you well, and I hope you are in high spirits. In recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their A-Level results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey.
16/1/24, 12:13 PM - Ashi Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?
16/1/24, 12:15 PM - +263 77 189 0220: I do not have the official results yet but I googled them online,they are not yet available at school

16/1/24, 7:04 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your results, and congratulations on successfully clearing all your A-Level subjects! Your hard work over the past few months has truly paid off.

I am sure your family is immensely proud of your achievements. Your A-level results have been duly noted, and we will quickly add them to your scholarship application. This will enable us to engage in discussions with the academic board and chart the best course of action for your next steps.
16/1/24, 7:05 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Kindly allow us time till Monday to thoroughly evaluate your results and plan the way forward. Once we have re-evaluated your application, along with all the other applications, Mr. Shubham, the senior career counselor at Edoofa will connect with you to guide you on the next steps in your academic career.

24/1/24, 8:24 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: We were overwhelmed and had to reject more applications because of limited seats, however were surely intrigued to know the reasons for such an immediate upsurge.  Having Conversations with my other students who are already preparing to arrive in India under the Edoofa Scholarship shared some mind-boggling Screenshots from the Fee Prospectus of the Universities in Zimbabwe.

24/1/24, 8:25 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: I am shocked to compile these data for Fee Structures of some famous Public Universities of Zimbabwe.

*Bindura University of Science Education (BUSE)* -https://www.buse.ac.zw/fees-structure/ - *($680 per term)*

*Chinhoyi University of Technology (CUT)* https://www.cut.ac.zw/welcome/assets/files/fees-structure/School%20of%20Engineering%20Science.pdf - *($535 per term)*

*University of Zimbabwe (UZ)* -https://www.uz.ac.zw/index.php/faculties/160-fac-of-medicine/med-deparrtments/305-med-dpt-of-comm *($523 per term)*

NUST -*($870 per term)*
24/1/24, 8:25 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: *I am sure you and your family must have also discussed this,*. So what have you decided for your future ahead?
24/1/24, 10:18 AM - +263 77 189 0220: My parents haven't decided anything yet as they are trying their best to allocate me to an affordable university
24/1/24, 11:30 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: So after looking at the facts shared above what do you think is more advantageous, to study at a globally recognized university abroad with an abundance of exposure and opportunities or to study at a local university where you will have no guarantee if you would get a job or not? <This message was edited>
24/1/24, 11:37 AM - +263 77 189 0220: Of course a globally recognised university is more advantageous sir
24/1/24, 12:40 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: That's great to hear!
24/1/24, 12:41 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: That is absolutely understandable and thank you for sharing. Being a senior academican and counsellor, my aspirations for young learners like you are similar. I firmly believe higher education should combine the following for a learner to achieve their goals:-

Quality Education
Conducive Environment
Critical Thinking and Practical learning skills
Technological Literacy and Attachments
Cultural Awareness and Global Perspective
Career guidance, Mentorships, etc.

*However, not everyone achieves success. Do you know why*?
24/1/24, 12:45 PM - +263 77 189 0220: Because they would be lacking some of the above mentioned qualities perhaps <This message was edited>
24/1/24, 12:52 PM - +263 77 189 0220: Though when I started researching about the Edoofa Scholarship I honestly thought that since it's a 90 % scholarship, Edoofa would be paying most of my fees and making my dream of a higher education come true however the  fees that have been mentioned by Galgotias University do not show much about how Edoofa is helping with my fees though the counselling session are exciting and the Earn While You Learn Program is an exercise one would never want to miss
24/1/24, 1:44 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: I understand Lynn

As a Senior Academician at the Edoofa Scholarship Program, I am here to offer you comprehensive support in planning for your education and guide you through the details. We understand that ensuring that you receive a quality education is a significant financial commitment, and we are here to help you make informed decisions for your brighter future.
