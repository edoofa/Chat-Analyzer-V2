I trust this message reaches you in good health. I have been looking forward to the response from your side, but it seems my previous messages may have gone unnoticed for quite some time now. This has raised some concerns on my part, which is affecting your scholarship application. 

I am more than willing to continue with your journey, Hence I wanted to understand if there is something that is bothering you. If you're ready now, please let me know so that we can proceed with the discussion. If my understanding is correct, I am assuming that you have something that you want to share with us, right?
16/1/24, 12:04 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Vimbai,

I trust this message finds you well, and I hope you are in high spirits. In recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their A-Level results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey.
16/1/24, 12:04 PM - Ashi Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?

*Chinhoyi University of Technology (CUT)* https://www.cut.ac.zw/welcome/assets/files/fees-structure/School%20of%20Engineering%20Science.pdf - *($535 per term)*

30/1/24, 1:06 PM - +263 77 352 7487: Right now we are between a rock and a hard place!!

30/1/24, 1:10 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: So you do not want Vimbai to pursue tertiary edeucation then?
30/1/24, 1:12 PM - +263 77 352 7487: That's not what I mean, i want her to go further but funds are not permissible
30/1/24, 1:30 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: I understand so how are you planning to  manage all the same?
30/1/24, 2:17 PM - +263 77 352 7487: We do not have any means so far to afford her education.
30/1/24, 2:18 PM - +263 77 352 7487: But we would really appreciate any help

30/1/24, 2:41 PM - +263 77 352 7487: Thank you
30/1/24, 2:52 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Let me help you understand the Situation in Zimbabwe in much more detail

While the cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, the cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal which is Sadza and curry costs a student $1 one time and you are aware of this better. The cost of *Accommodation, Food, Wifi, stationery, gadgets, transport* etc is an additional expense for a student. The initial registration fee for the Zimbabwean Universities ranges from *$20-$75 without the guarantee of being eligible or not.* The *attachment fee before graduation ranges from $200 or more.*
30/1/24, 2:52 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Let me tell you, I was caught in surprise when I compared it with the Edoofa Scholarship Program, not because of affordability but the opportunity to acquire skills, knowledge and be employable. Speaking about Employability, do you feel Zimbabwe is ready to equip the graduates with job opportunities in their aspired fields?
30/1/24, 2:57 PM - +263 77 352 7487: I don't see that Happening anytime soon Sir
30/1/24, 3:35 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: So shall I assist you with the same?
30/1/24, 3:36 PM - +263 77 352 7487: Please, it will be greatly appreciated
30/1/24, 4:09 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Being a senior academician and counsellor, my aspirations for young learners like you are similar. I firmly believe higher education should combine the following for a learner to achieve their goals:-

Quality Education
Conducive Environment
Critical Thinking and Practical learning skills
Technological Literacy and Attachments
Cultural Awareness and Global Perspective
Career guidance, Mentorships, etc.

*However, not everyone achieves success. Do you know why*?
30/1/24, 4:32 PM - +263 77 352 7487: School me please

30/1/24, 4:52 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: I see you are quite a visionary and we will work together to make the right decision for your career. It is important to know why the Edoofa guidance will be unique compared to the normal University approach.
30/1/24, 4:52 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: *1. Personalized mentorship and guidance throughout your course:* As your Career Counsellor, I have known you since the beginning of the process, understanding your interests, aspirations, family background and plans for your career, unlike a University officer who may come across your application for the first time and treats with the same importance like others. I personally understand where you come from and what is required for you to be successful.
30/1/24, 4:52 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: *2. The Earn While You Learn Program:*  Even though the EWYL program was affected by lessons and exams in Zimbabwe, you will have access to a streamlined process here in India with better earning projects, regular visits by mentors, seminars and training programs which even opens self-financing opportunities. Students have even catered their entire costs through their EWYL earnings.
30/1/24, 4:52 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
30/1/24, 4:52 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: *3. Financial Support and Planning:* With a flexible payment plan for registration fees spreading across 45 days, the remaining cost of education can be paid in two installments. Students are ensured to open Indian bank accounts so that parents can even deposit the fees in monthly installments.
