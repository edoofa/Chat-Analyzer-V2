After resolving your concerns, I'll guide you through starting your financial security plan. 

While most students can discuss this with their parents the same day, I understand everyone is different. Could you let me know by when you think you'll have the discussion with your parents? This way, we can schedule our next session accordingly.

9/1/24, 9:36 PM - Dev Edoofa: Before we get into the specifics of your admission journey and talk about your admission process, I would like to share an exciting milestone that India as a country achieved within the first week of 2024 – the successful India's Chandrayaan-3 Engine Test. This accomplishment is responsible for the third lunar mission, aiming to land a rover on the Moon's south polar region and conduct scientific studies that could check Moon's viability to sustain life. It signifies a significant scientific advancement, laying the groundwork for future progress.
9/1/24, 9:37 PM - Dev Edoofa: This achievement has not only pushed boundaries but also inspired young minds all over the world to pursue their dreams. On the same note, I wanted to extend my heartiest wishes for the New Year to you and your family and check in to see how you and your family started your year?
9/1/24, 9:37 PM - +263 78 480 6407: How are u sir

If I talk about myself, I have made a resolution to bring more humility in myself and bring about a change in my perspective to be a better version of myself all while ensuring that I help all of our students to achieve their educational goals. With that said, I would like to know what aspirations or a change in your approach towards life you wish to achieve?
12/1/24, 11:23 AM - +263 78 480 6407: Ok sir

Through my educational pursuits and life experiences, I have learned the importance of continued learning and growth. I am passionate about making a positive impact on the world around me, both through my career and my personal life. Maintaining meaningful relationships with friends, family, and colleagues is also a top priority for me. I believe that my desire to be the best version of myself and to make a difference in the world will allow me to be a successful and productive member of society.
Thank you for considering
12/1/24, 3:56 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am delighted to hear that you want to become a better version of yourself by making a positive impact on others and forming meaningful relations. This is something that is much appreciated to hear from such young minds who are already mature enough to be aware of the aspects they need to work on. I must commend this.
12/1/24, 3:57 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, moving towards the admission process, We, at Edoofa, are determined to provide affordable higher education to hardworking students and assist them in launching their careers to greater heights. We will be able to help you only if we can connect timely and have healthy discussions.
12/1/24, 3:57 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, this is something I want to inform you all that the agenda for the discussions, that we are going to have, is to help you all understand the process you will undertake for his university admission journey and what your family will be experiencing with the Edoofa Scholarship Program over the next one and a half years. However, since you are going to be occupied with school and your parents are occupied with work during the day, it seems that the same challenge in connectivity is going to persist for the next couple of months as well.
12/1/24, 3:57 PM - Dev Edoofa: With that being said, what I can do right now to solve this constraint is give you the freedom to choose the time slot for our sessions over the next 10 days [till 20th January]. This way, we can align it with our availability as well and help you move forward and make progress in a streamlined manner. Could you please let me know at what time you would be available from Monday to Friday between 08:00 AM and 06:00 PM? This would help us factor in your input and find the right time for our sessions.

29/1/24, 1:12 PM - +263 77 238 8186: Good afternoon, we are doing well
29/1/24, 1:34 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Before reaching out to you today, I was going through pictures and videos from Edoofa's very first SLICE CON held last week, and that sparked my curiosity about whether you are familiar with what SLICE CON is or not?
29/1/24, 1:40 PM - +263 77 238 8186: Uuhh no what is that
29/1/24, 2:01 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is alright, Let me tell you a bit about the same.  Recently, Edoofa hosted a conference called the Symposium of Leaders, Innovators, and Creators at Edoofa, also known as 'SLICE-CON.'
29/1/24, 2:01 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: The conference was attended by all the Edoofians of 2023 and a few senior Edoofians from previous batches. It focused on the art of creation, innovation, and, most importantly, the mindset required to make an impact in one's career.
29/1/24, 2:01 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: During this Industrial Visit and the conference - SLICE CON, Corporate leaders, such as the CEOs and Co-founders from renowned companies like Rage Coffee, Sirona Hygiene, Jolin New York, and more, shared their insights and experiences. These individuals are at the helm of multi-millionaire brands, leading large marketing teams. Their presence added immense value, providing students with the opportunity to engage in transformative conversations.

29/1/24, 2:06 PM - +263 77 238 8186: Waal that's interesting
29/1/24, 2:38 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Certainly. This was indeed a momentous step for all of our students, making them employable ready and giving them access to the right opportunities for their careers ahead.
29/1/24, 2:38 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Also, regarding the discussion we had the other day about the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan, I wanted to follow up on our last conversation. Have you, as a family, been able to discuss it? If so, I would like to understand how the discussion went. What were their thoughts about it? Did they have any specific queries or concerns that you would like us to address?
30/1/24, 1:37 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Simon. I hope everything is well on your end. I was hoping to get a response form your end yesterday, but it seems like due to some reason we were unable to move ahead with our discussion. Before we proceed with our discussion today, I would like to check in on you and your family. How are you all doing today?
30/1/24, 1:46 PM - +263 77 238 8186: Afternoon sorry for the late response, so far we are satisfied
30/1/24, 2:06 PM - +263 78 480 6407: Afternoon maam
30/1/24, 2:07 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know, Parents and Simon. For the current round of students, there are only 27 seats available for the students who can benefit from the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan. 

Since you have been one of the most dedicated students, and I see you have great aspirations, I wanted you to be a part of the same set of students and start with your future planning the right way.
30/1/24, 2:07 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Also, as this plan commences from the month of January, for the efficient implementation of this plan, we need to decide on a fixed date on which you will deposit $150 every month. This will provide you with the flexibility to align your finances accordingly.
30/1/24, 2:07 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Our complete focus is on providing students and parents with the best ways to avail themselves of these opportunities. We understand that every parent may not be able to make the payment on our specified date. Therefore, considering this situation, we allow them to decide the payment date according to their comfort. In light of the same, may I know the fixed date every month on which you will deposit $150?
30/1/24, 2:12 PM - +263 78 480 6407: There is my former school mate on this picture
30/1/24, 2:12 PM - +263 78 480 6407: Ok maam
30/1/24, 2:38 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Wow, that is so amazing to know that your former school mate was present here for the SLICE Con'24. In such a case, you can connect with him to know about his experience at the event! Next year, you will also be present here to attend your first SLICE Con'24 and get opportunities to learn and grow from industry specialists themselves!
30/1/24, 2:39 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: May I know if you were able to decide on a monthly deposit date Simon?
30/1/24, 2:43 PM - +263 77 238 8186: Yes we are opening an FBC account for Simon which we are going to deposit the 150 monthly,
30/1/24, 2:50 PM - +263 78 480 6407: Yeah can't wait
30/1/24, 3:26 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I believe there has been a misunderstanding. Under Edoofa's Financial Secure Plan you are required to deposit the monthly $150 amount to Edoofa for the first 10 months, after the completion of which you are required to open a Nostro account under Simon's name. With the Financial Secure Plan, you get to avail benefits like $150 waiver of your remaining enrollment fee amount along with the flexibility of choosing the monthly deposit date. If you choose to save the money in your account, I am afraid you will not be eligible to avail these benefits. May I know if we are on the same page here?
30/1/24, 4:04 PM - +263 77 238 8186: OK that's where our query is bcz we were thinking that you need to secure Simon's place then we are certain and free to deposit in your account, you know these days anything can happen and we not be able to retrieve our money, so I think we know to know which university our Son is going and how much are supposed to pay for his fees, that way will be very clear to us, that's our opinion
30/1/24, 4:52 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. Thank you for sharing your concern with me. For the 2025 intake, the offer letter from the universities will be processed by them post the month of August. In the meanwhile, Edoofa is helping the students in planning their finances by offering the Financial Secure Plan, to ensure that the student does not face any unforeseen challenges or difficulties when they arrive in India for their higher education., which we are discussing currently.
30/1/24, 4:53 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: The Edoofa Scholarship Program has worked with over 250 universities, all of which are recognized by UGC (University Grants Commission) and AICTE (All India Council for Technical Education). While it is impractical to list all these universities, let me share a few notable ones that excel in exposure, affordability, culture, and academics and the ones we will be considering for Tauya's education:

- Lovely Professional University
- Colleges under Uttarakhand Technical University
- Colleges under Punjab Technical University
- Galgotias University
- MVN University
30/1/24, 4:53 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: With the same list, the Academic Board at Edoofa will evaluate students' applications in the month of August. Based on various factors such as their A Level Statement of Entry, O Level Results, merit, extracurricular activities, Statement of Purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa, they will finalize a list of universities where your child's application will be shared. Subsequently, you will receive offer letters from these universities. Until then, our goal is to assist you in preparing your educational finances so that once you receive the offer letters, you can secure the scholarship seat promptly. I hope you are clear with this?
30/1/24, 5:00 PM - +263 77 238 8186: That's very clear, that's why we are opting to Open an account for Simon, and as we are into businesses of construction so about the finances I am sure we will be 5 to raise it considering where he is going now, it's a private school and we are not struggling to raise all his needs so I am very sure with our plan here we will not disappoint you
30/1/24, 5:02 PM - +263 77 238 8186: Once he get the offer letter we can now start to deposit in your account know where and which university he is going, that's our stance so far
30/1/24, 5:51 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. I am sure that with your planning you will be able to raise the amount of money for Simon. However, since there are 20-30% of students who fail to do so, the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan comes in place. Sometimes, due to unforeseen challenges, we might face a difficult financial situation. To avoid risking your son's higher education during such difficult times, this plan will be beneficial for you. Moreover, with the Financial Secure Plan, you also get the added benefit of the $150 waive off. I understand that you wish to open an account for Simon instead of depositing the same amount here with us, however, there aren't any disadvantages that you might face by being on-board with the Financial Secure Plan.
