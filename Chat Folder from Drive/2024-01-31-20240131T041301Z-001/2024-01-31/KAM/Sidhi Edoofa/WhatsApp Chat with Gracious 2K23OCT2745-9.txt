12/1/24, 4:06 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, this is something I want to inform you all that the agenda for the discussions, that we are going to have, is to help you all understand the process you will undertake for his university admission journey and what your family will be experiencing with the Edoofa Scholarship Program over the next one and a half years. However, since you are going to be occupied with school and your parents are occupied with work during the day, it seems that the same challenge in connectivity is going to persist for the next couple of months as well.
12/1/24, 4:06 PM - Dev Edoofa: With that being said, what I can do right now to solve this constraint is give you the freedom to choose the time slot for our sessions over the next 10 days [till 20th January].

Could you please let me know at what time you would be available from Monday to Friday between 08:00 AM and 06:00 PM? This would help us factor in your input and find the right time for our sessions.

Since my operational hours accommodate your timings more suitably, I will be assuming the duties of your admission officer. I am optimistic that together, we can pave the way for an auspicious beginning to your academic journey, resulting in the right career prospects and eventual success for both you and your family.

27/1/24, 10:58 AM - +263 78 992 7576: Hello Ms Siddhi, I sincerely apologize for not being available at the right time, I was caught up in something 
I'm very sorry 

We can proceed
27/1/24, 10:59 AM - +263 78 992 7576: We are all fine how are you?
27/1/24, 11:27 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to know that you are all doing fine. It is completely alright please, I understand that sometimes we get caught up with urgent matters. I am doing fine myself, thank you for asking.
27/1/24, 11:27 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Since this is the first time we are interacting, allow me to introduce myself. I am Miss Siddhi Singh, your Admission Officer. I belong from the vibrant city of Varanasi, known as one of the oldest living cities globally, Beyond my passion for education, I find joy in music and playing basketball. It is my pleasure to assist and guide you through the admission process, ensuring you achieve your dream education in India with the support of Edoofa.
27/1/24, 11:29 AM - +263 78 992 7576: My pleasure

27/1/24, 11:53 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: The pleasure is mine, Gracious. I am glad to know that we also have similarities. I was going through your application profile and it is my understanding that you were being introduced to Edoofa's Financial Secure Plan. May I know if I am correct?
27/1/24, 12:01 PM - +263 78 992 7576: Yes that's correct
27/1/24, 12:32 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for confirming that. Could you kindly share your queries or thoughts about the same, if you have any?
27/1/24, 12:43 PM - +263 78 992 7576: I understand that my father would prefer to open a personal account for me to save money for my education, rather than using an account through Edoofa. I respect his decision and want to make sure we're following the best financial practices for my education
I don't know how does that sounds to you
27/1/24, 1:24 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. Thank you for letting me know that. The Financial Secure Plan is not mandatory for the students, and if you wish to save the money in your own bank account that is perfectly reasonable. However, since we are carefully planning and personalising every student's finances, we will require your help and cooperation to do so. The end goal is to ensure that you are successfully able to save up $1500 in the next 10 months so that you are not subjected to any difficulties when you come to India next year in 2025. In order to do that, you can deposit your money in your bank account and share the receipt with us every month so that we are also able to keep a track of your savings and help you plan for the future accordingly. I hope we are together in this?
27/1/24, 2:29 PM - +263 78 992 7576: Yes sure
27/1/24, 2:31 PM - +263 78 992 7576: Im not sure if we will be able to save the 1500 in the next ten months because I have to pay my exam registration fee before starting the fanancing plan 
But we are surely going to be  depositing money every month
27/1/24, 2:32 PM - +263 78 992 7576: My dad, will tell you his view, right now I think he's busy at work but he surely will talk to you after he's done
27/1/24, 3:39 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. I understand that you have school during the weekdays and your parents are occupied with work. In such a case, I want to ensure that our sessions are held in a timely and smooth manner so we can comfortably proceed with your application process and discuss the financial plan. Could you kindly suggest a 1-hour slot between 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM when we can have our sessions?
27/1/24, 4:14 PM - +263 78 992 7576: 4pm to 5pm is the right time
27/1/24, 4:14 PM - +263 78 992 7576: I will be done with school and I'm sure my parents won't be occupied too much
29/1/24, 4:14 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Gracious. I hope you are all doing well today. How has your day been going so far?
29/1/24, 4:28 PM - +263 78 992 7576: Good afternoon Ms Siddhi , my day has been okay, just dealing with Monday blues
29/1/24, 4:28 PM - +263 78 992 7576: How are you today?
29/1/24, 5:02 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. I am glad that your day has been going okay. I am doing fine too, thank you for asking. Before reaching out to you today, I was going through pictures and videos from Edoofa's very first SLICE CON held last week, and that sparked my curiosity about whether you are familiar with what SLICE CON is or not?
29/1/24, 6:52 PM - +263 78 992 7576: No i ain't ma'am
29/1/24, 6:54 PM - +263 78 992 7576: Well I'm now also curious to know what SLICE CON is

30/1/24, 5:20 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: During this Industrial Visit and the conference - SLICE CON, Corporate leaders, such as the CEOs and Co-founders from renowned companies like Rage Coffee, Sirona Hygiene, Jolin New York, and more, shared their insights and experiences. These individuals are at the helm of multi-millionaire brands, leading large marketing teams. Their presence added immense value, providing students with the opportunity to engage in transformative conversations.
30/1/24, 5:20 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Let me share a glimpse of the conference with you and your family. I am certain that Gracious too would be this excited to attend such events when he comes to India.
