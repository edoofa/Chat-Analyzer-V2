Upon reviewing your application file, I was both impressed and reassured to assist you in achieving these goals here in India, which will unlock doors to incredible opportunities in the future.
9/1/24, 9:37 PM - Dev Edoofa: Before we get into the specifics of your admission journey and talk about your admission process, I would like to share an exciting milestone that India as a country achieved within the first week of 2024 – the successful India's Chandrayaan-3 Engine Test. This accomplishment is responsible for the third lunar mission, aiming to land a rover on the Moon's south polar region and conduct scientific studies that could check Moon's viability to sustain life.

However, since you are going to be occupied with school and your parents are occupied with work during the day, it seems that the same challenge in connectivity is going to persist for the next couple of months as well.
12/1/24, 3:31 PM - Dev Edoofa: With that being said, what I can do right now to solve this constraint is give you the freedom to choose the time slot for our sessions over the next 10 days [till 20th January]. This way, we can align it with our availability as well and help you move forward and make progress in a streamlined manner. Could you please let me know at what time you would be available from Monday to Friday between 08:00 AM and 06:00 PM? This would help us factor in your input and find the right time for our sessions.

Since my operational hours accommodate your timings more suitably, I will be assuming the duties of your admission officer.

29/1/24, 1:54 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: To address your concern, the Edoofa Scholarship Program has worked with over 250 universities, all of which are recognized by UGC (University Grants Commission) and AICTE (All India Council for Technical Education). While it is impractical to list all these universities, let me share a few notable ones that excel in exposure, affordability, culture, and academics and the ones we will be considering for Kudakwashe's education:

- Lovely Professional University
- Colleges under Uttarakhand Technical University
- Colleges under Punjab Technical University
- Galgotias University
- MVN University
29/1/24, 1:54 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: With the same list, the Academic Board at Edoofa will evaluate students' applications in the month of August. Based on various factors such as their A Level Statement of Entry, O Level Results, merit, extracurricular activities, Statement of Purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa, they will finalize a list of universities where your child's application will be shared. Subsequently, you will receive offer letters from these universities. Until then, our goal is to assist you in preparing your educational finances so that once you receive the offer letters, you can secure the scholarship seat promptly. I hope you are clear with this?
29/1/24, 1:57 PM - +263 77 267 7923: Well noted mam
29/1/24, 2:00 PM - +267 71 504 622: I understand
29/1/24, 2:32 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: You are most welcome. Before reaching out to you today, I was going through pictures and videos from Edoofa's very first SLICE CON held last week, and that sparked my curiosity about whether you are familiar with what SLICE CON is or not?
29/1/24, 3:47 PM - +263 77 267 7923: No..we are not familiar with the slice con
29/1/24, 4:09 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is alright, Let me tell you a bit about the same.  Recently, Edoofa hosted a conference called the Symposium of Leaders, Innovators, and Creators at Edoofa, also known as 'SLICE-CON.'
29/1/24, 4:09 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: The conference was attended by all the Edoofians of 2023 and a few senior Edoofians from previous batches. It focused on the art of creation, innovation, and, most importantly, the mindset required to make an impact in one's career.
29/1/24, 4:09 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: During this Industrial Visit and the conference - SLICE CON, Corporate leaders, such as the CEOs and Co-founders from renowned companies like Rage Coffee, Sirona Hygiene, Jolin New York, and more, shared their insights and experiences. These individuals are at the helm of multi-millionaire brands, leading large marketing teams. Their presence added immense value, providing students with the opportunity to engage in transformative conversations.
29/1/24, 4:09 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Let me share a glimpse of the conference with you and your family. I am certain that you too would be this excited to attend such events when he comes to India.

29/1/24, 4:09 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Let me know once you are able to go through the messages about the SLICE CON, along with the images and videos shared with you. This was indeed a momentous step for all of our students, making them employable ready and giving them access to the right opportunities for their careers ahead.
29/1/24, 4:19 PM - +263 77 267 7923: Certainly will we..thanks for sharing
29/1/24, 4:54 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Certainly. Also, regarding the discussion we had the other day about the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan, I wanted to follow up on our last conversation. Have you, as a family, been able to discuss it? If so, I would like to understand how the discussion went. What were their thoughts about it? Did they have any specific queries or concerns that you would like us to address?
29/1/24, 4:58 PM - +263 77 267 7923: Yes..we did discuss as a family and we agreed that its a good plan..coz the plan will offload pressure on us when it comes to fees ..applying for visa e.t.c.
29/1/24, 5:26 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know, Parents and Kudakwashe. For the current round of students, there are only 27 seats available for the students who can benefit from the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan. 

Since you have been one of the most dedicated students, and I see you have great aspirations, I wanted you to be a part of the same set of students and start with your future planning the right way.
29/1/24, 5:26 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Also, as this plan commences from the month of January, for the efficient implementation of this plan, we need to decide on a fixed date on which you will deposit $150 every month. This will provide you with the flexibility to align your finances accordingly.
29/1/24, 5:26 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Our complete focus is on providing students and parents with the best ways to avail themselves of these opportunities. We understand that every parent may not be able to make the payment on our specified date. Therefore, considering this situation, we allow them to decide the payment date according to their comfort. In light of the same, may I know the fixed date every month on which you will deposit $150?
29/1/24, 5:30 PM - +263 77 267 7923: Will have to.talk to my husband about the issue..Will get back to u tmrrw .
29/1/24, 5:45 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. In such a case, let us reconnect tomorrow at our scheduled time to further discuss the payment plan. I hope that by then you will be able to discuss the same with your family and come up with a date. Until then, please take care and have a blessed day ahead!
29/1/24, 5:46 PM - +263 77 267 7923: Same to u
30/1/24, 1:30 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Kudakwashe. I hope everything is well on your end. Before we proceed with our discussion today, I would like to check in on you and your family. How are you all doing today?
30/1/24, 1:32 PM - +267 71 504 622: We are good and you
30/1/24, 1:57 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. I am well too, thank you for asking. May I know if you were able to discuss the plan with your family and if you have decided on a monthly date for the deposits?
30/1/24, 2:21 PM - +267 71 504 622: The date for the deposits I can manage to start end of June the reason as I was  saying before I  am lving Botswana going back home to start  a new job on 2 may 2024  thus I said end of June
30/1/24, 2:43 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. Thank you for sharing that information with me. In such a case, if you start in the month of June, it will get difficult to deposit a total amount on $1500 by the end of November. The reason that the plan is spread across 10 months is to ensure that you do not face heavy financial constraints every month. Since you are planning to begin in the month of June, may I know if you were able to decide the amount that you will be depositing every month till the month of November to ensure that you are able to save $1500?
30/1/24, 3:40 PM - +267 71 504 622: Ok let me talk to my wife later after work then 
 l will come back to you with the figure that will can manage to deposit every month end
30/1/24, 4:26 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. In such a case, let us conclude today's conversation and reconnect tomorrow at our scheduled time i.e., 1:00 PM. I hope that by then you will be able to discuss the details of the plan and payment with your wife. Have a blessed day ahead!
30/1/24, 5:11 PM - +267 71 504 622: Thank you so much
