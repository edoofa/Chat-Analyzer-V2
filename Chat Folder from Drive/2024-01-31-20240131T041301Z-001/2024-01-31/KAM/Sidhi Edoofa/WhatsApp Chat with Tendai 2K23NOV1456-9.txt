19/12/23, 9:14 PM - +263 77 455 3293: 3.How are the theories aerodynamics used in the aerospace engineering field

Theories of aerodynamics play a cruicial role in the aerospace engineering field.
Engineers use these theories to design  and analyse aircraft , spacecraft and other aerospace vehicles.

These principles of aerodynamics,engineers can optimise the shape ,size and performance of these vehicles.They use such as Bernoulli's principle, Newton laws of motion and the concept of drag to predict and control the behavior of air and fluid flow around the vehicle.
 They also play a crucial role in the aerospace engineering field.They are used to understand and predict the behavior of aircraft and spacecraft in various flight conditions
 
The theories of aerodynamics are designing aircraft,performance , stability and control, wind tunnel testing and computatoral fluid dynamics  

1. Designing aircraft: Aerodynamics theories are used to design the shape and configuration of aircraft wings, fuselage, and other components. The flow of air around these structures, engineers can optimize their design for efficient lift, reduced drag, and improved stability.

2. Performance analysis: Aerodynamics theories help engineers analyze the performance of aircraft and spacecraft. They can predict factors such as lift, drag, thrust, and fuel consumption under different flight conditions. This information is crucial for determining the aircraft's range, speed, and payload capacity.

3.

Stability and control: Aerodynamics theories are used to study the stability and control of aircraft.These  forces and moments act on an aircraft, engineers can design control surfaces like ailerons, elevators, and rudders to ensure stable flight and maneuverability.

4. Wind tunnel testing: Aerodynamics theories guide the design and interpretation of wind tunnel tests. Wind tunnels are used to simulate the airflow around an aircraft or spacecraft at different speeds and angles.
The data collected from these tests helps validate and refine the aerodynamic models used in the design process.

5. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD): Aerodynamics theories are implemented in computer simulations known as CFD. These simulations use mathematical equations to model the flow
19/12/23, 9:14 PM - +263 77 455 3293: 4: Lift augmentation
Devices are used in aircraft to enhance the lift generated by the wings .

Flaps 
These are hinged surface on the trailing edge of the wings that can be extended or retracted .By extending the flaps the wings surface area increases creating more lift at lower speeds such as during take off and landing

Slats are movable surfaces located at the leading edge of the wings when extended .

The most common high lift devices are flaps ,stats and Krueger flaps but the category also induces less common installations such as leading edge root extensions which are found on high performance fighter aircraft and boundary layer control devices inclusive of blown flaps .

20/12/23, 6:13 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, dear parents and Tendai!

I hope you are doing well today. I was not able to connect with you earlier as it was past my available hours at the moment. I would like to let you know that our available hours daily will be from 6:00 pm to 9:00 pm every day for this session. With that said may I know if you are now ready to proceed with the session?
20/12/23, 6:13 PM - +263 77 455 3293: Afternoon sir we are ready to proceed
20/12/23, 6:14 PM - +263 71 338 7901: Evening sir we are ready to proceed
20/12/23, 7:13 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Thank you for providing the details with me. With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey. we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*.

However, before we do the same, I was going through your scholarship application file and noticed that you are supposed to make the payment of your remaining part of Edoofa Enrollment fee before 20th December 2023. Hence, I thought of sharing a gentle reminder with you and trying to understand how your preparation has been so far? Have you been able to align your preparations in the right direction?
20/12/23, 7:15 PM - +263 77 455 3293: Sir the payment we were supposed to do isn't it $350 ? If so we have paid in full . We can resend the proof of payment.
20/12/23, 7:19 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for the clarification. There was a clerical error on our end. Yes you have paid the full amount, please.
20/12/23, 7:20 PM - +263 77 455 3293: Ok sir thank you
20/12/23, 7:20 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: In the meantime, let us move forward with our discussion. To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is B.Tech (Aerospace Engineering) and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2025. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
20/12/23, 7:21 PM - +263 77 455 3293: Yes that's correct
20/12/23, 7:47 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. Based on our experience of over 14 years and having assisted over 5000 students from different countries, we have realized that financial planning is the most important factor when a student plans for his/her higher education abroad.
20/12/23, 7:47 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am sure that you must be aware that 20-30% of students who are admitted into universities abroad are unable to fulfill their dream and come to India due to a lack of financial planning. The funds needed for booking flights, accommodation, and covering living expenses after arrival often become overwhelming, leading to the decision to defer their admission for a year. This, in turn, creates a gap in the child's education.
20/12/23, 7:47 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: To assist both students and parents in this regard, Edoofa Management has designed a Financial Secure Plan that aims to help you prepare for your higher educational finances without experiencing stress or last-minute rushes. I believe you must be wondering about the details of the same plan and how it helps the parents?
20/12/23, 7:50 PM - +263 77 455 3293: Yes sir you can elaborate further
20/12/23, 8:06 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Edoofa Secure Plan is important for parents who have children joining the university for tertiary education in the next one to two years for several reasons:

*Financial Preparedness:* The Edoofa Secure plan helps parents prepare financially for the costs after the Scholarship being offered so that they are not caught off guard.

*Reduced Financial Stress:* Having the Edoofa Secure Plan in place can significantly reduce the financial stress on you as parents when your child is about to enter university. Knowing that there is a dedicated fund for education expenses provides peace of mind.

*Avoiding Debt*: Without proper savings, some parents may resort to taking out loans or accumulating credit card debt to cover their child's education costs. This Educational savings plan helps avoid the burden of debt and high-interest payments.

*Compound Interest:* By starting to save early and consistently contributing to the savings plan, parents can take advantage of compound interest, which can significantly increase the amount available for education expenses.

*Flexibility and Control:* The Edoofa Secure savings plans allow parents to have greater control over their finances and how they allocate funds for their child's education. They can choose investment options that align with their risk tolerance and financial goals.
20/12/23, 8:06 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Encouraging Responsibility*: Involving your child in the process of saving for their education teaches them financial responsibility and the value of higher education. It also motivates them to outperform in Academics.

*Adapting to Unexpected Changes*: Life is full of surprises, and circumstances can change especially when there are political reforms changing each day impacting the Local Currency. Having an Edoofa Secure Plan allows parents to adapt to unexpected changes in their financial situation while still prioritizing their child's education.

*Peace of Mind:* Overall, having the Edoofa Secure plan provides parents with peace of mind, knowing that they are actively planning for their child's future and increasing the likelihood of providing them with a solid education.

Now, when you go through all the above benefits, I am sure you can see that the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan is an important financial tool for parents/students who are supposed to enter the university soon. 

It helps ensure that the financial aspect of tertiary education is well-managed, reduces stress, and allows parents to provide the best opportunities for their children without resorting to debt or financial hardship. Isn't this something you and your family also wish to have?
20/12/23, 8:53 PM - +263 77 455 3293: Ok l understand. So how does this plan work <This message was edited>
20/12/23, 8:54 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for being online and proceeding with the session with me for today. As my available hours are coming to an end I am closing our session for now and let us continue tomorrow. Have a great day and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
20/12/23, 8:54 PM - +263 77 455 3293: Ok thank you
21/12/23, 6:03 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening, dear parents and Tendai !

I hope this message finds you well and blessed. May I know if you are currently available so that we can proceed with the session for your admission process?
21/12/23, 6:06 PM - +263 77 455 3293: Good evening sir ,yes we can proceed
21/12/23, 6:55 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. May I know if you were able to go through the above points?
21/12/23, 6:57 PM - +263 77 455 3293: Yes
21/12/23, 6:59 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through the above points, do you want me to help you understand how the Edoofa Secure Plan works?
21/12/23, 7:01 PM - +263 77 455 3293: Yes sir
21/12/23, 7:17 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, as you are aware, we are currently in December 2023, and we have a good 20-21 months to plan for your finances before you start your university education in 2025.
21/12/23, 7:17 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: During the counseling session, you were informed that at Edoofa, we guarantee a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship on the tuition fees. Hence, the cost of education, including food and accommodation after the scholarship, would be between $2700-$3700, and it could be even less. Not more than that.
21/12/23, 7:17 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: This means that if you can save $150 per month for the next 20 months, you will be able to save $3000. This amount is more than enough for the first year of university fees, including tuition fees (if any), food, and accommodation. I hope you agree with this?
21/12/23, 7:24 PM - +263 71 338 7901: Yes we agree . And that after  20 months we could have saved $3000
21/12/23, 8:06 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Right, this means that by the time you would be in India, you would have already saved the $3000 that will cover the first-year fee.
21/12/23, 8:06 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, in these next 20 months, I am sure you would also be engaged in the EWYL program, and if you secure a minimum of $1000 in 20 months, that means the fees for 1.5 years are already secured.
21/12/23, 8:06 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, for a 3-year course, if we follow the same approach for the remaining 1.5 years, the educational journey for the student and the financial journey for the parent will be easy and smooth. I believe you must be able to see this perspective? <This message was edited>
21/12/23, 8:09 PM - +263 71 338 7901: Yes yes i see but isnt b tech aerospace a four year course . Using information we received earlier when we got the explanation of the course
21/12/23, 8:12 PM - +263 71 338 7901: We were of the opinion that tendai starts her EWYL in November 2025 after she sits for her final exams . Shes in a school where use of phones is prohibited and the EWYL will not be conducted smoothly because of this . But after shes done she will have access ro a phone .
21/12/23, 8:13 PM - +263 71 338 7901: However during holidays which are a month long she will have access to a phone . I dont know if the EWYL can be done during her holidays which are at most 30 days .
21/12/23, 8:41 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is correct, please excuse me for the error here.
21/12/23, 8:42 PM - +263 77 455 3293: Okay
21/12/23, 8:43 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: About the EWYL process that is completely possible and we shall have a detailed explanation about the same once we have shared you with the details. May I know if you are clear with me now?
21/12/23, 8:43 PM - +263 77 455 3293: Yes
21/12/23, 8:59 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for being online and proceeding with the session with me for today. As my available hours are coming to an end I am closing our session for now and let us continue tomorrow properly. Have a great day and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
21/12/23, 9:01 PM - +263 71 338 7901: Thank you sir . Same to you .
27/12/23, 7:45 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening dear parents and Tendai. I hope this message finds you well and blessed. 

It has been a while. May I know if you are now ready to proceed with the session for your admission process?
27/12/23, 7:46 PM - +263 77 455 3293: Good evening we are ready
27/12/23, 7:56 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, from the 16th Month till the 20th month, considering it is a 6-month window, you can again continue depositing the money ($150) with Edoofa which can be used in the fee as and when required or you can decide to save this $900 of these 6 months with you as well. This is something which you are free to choose. I hope you have understood the financial secure plan now?
27/12/23, 7:59 PM - +263 77 455 3293: Yes sir understood
27/12/23, 8:17 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: That's great. Now that you have all the information, I want you to take some time and discuss the financial security plan with your family members. Help them understand its importance and details. Once you're done, we can reconnect, have a discussion, and address any queries you may have. After resolving your concerns, I'll guide you through starting your financial security plan. 

While most students can discuss this with their parents the same day, I understand everyone is different. Could you let me know by when you think you'll have the discussion with your parents? This way, we can schedule our next session accordingly.
27/12/23, 8:26 PM - +263 77 455 3293: We  will be done by tomorrow morning so next session can be done tomorrow anytime
27/12/23, 8:38 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: That's perfectly fine. In that case, we will conclude today's conversation, and I will connect with you on Thursday to resume our discussion. In the meantime, I hope you'll have a detailed discussion with your family and jot down any questions or thoughts you have regarding the Financial Secure plan.

Wishing you a good day ahead, and please extend our regards to your family.
27/12/23, 8:40 PM - +263 77 455 3293: Ok thank you sir
28/12/23, 6:09 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening!

I hope you are having a wonderful evening with your family as we are approaching a New Year. May I know if you are ready to proceed with the session for the admission process?
28/12/23, 6:13 PM - +263 77 455 3293: Evening hw are you
28/12/23, 6:18 PM - +263 77 455 3293: Yes sir we can proceed
28/12/23, 6:29 PM - +263 77 455 3293: We have discussed and resolved that we Do the 150usd 1stto 10th month with Edoofa savings then 11thmonth to 14th  FBC account then 15th to 20th with Edoofa
 
 But we have these  questions which need clarifications
1.Does the Edoofa plan for 1st to 10th month have 12.5% deposit charge fee as if that initial 350usd deposit?

2 Which one is cheaper financially to save with Edoofa on the 15th to 20th months....and keeping money in FBC Nostro local account?

3.If in any way, The Zimbabwean currency changes.... Will we be cock sure that the money we deposited with Edoofa is safe from the negative financial effects likely to affect our local deposits?

4.Does this payment plan cover the 50%-100% scholarship batches such that it might be more in the event that we get a higher scholarship percentage....and better still if EWYL tokensare included?
28/12/23, 7:50 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you so much for sharing these questions with me. Please allow me some time, I shall frame the answers and share it with you.
28/12/23, 7:54 PM - +263 77 455 3293: Ok sir thank you
29/12/23, 9:33 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I was not able to continue with the session today as I was on a call with the university officials. As my available hours are coming to an end I am closing the session for today and let us connect on the 2nd of January. Along with that, as we stand on the threshold of a new year, I extend my heartfelt wishes to you and your family for a prosperous and fulfilling 2024.

I am glad to know that you had a great start to the year and I hope you are excited for the new day and most importantly the new year as well. @263774553293 , the new year brings about a transformative mindset in us which may not emphasize immediate changes but a change in the direction that you believe is needed.

If I talk about myself, I have made a resolution to bring more humility in myself and bring about a change in my perspective to be a better version of myself all while ensuring that I help all of our students to achieve their educational goals. With that said, I would like to know what aspirations or a change in your approach towards life you wish to achieve? <This message was edited>

We will be able to help you only if we can connect timely and have healthy discussions.
12/1/24, 8:35 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, this is something I want to inform you all that the agenda for the discussions, that we are going to have, is to help you all understand the process you will undertake for his university admission journey and what your family will be experiencing with the Edoofa Scholarship Program over the next one and a half years. However, since you are going to be occupied with school and your parents are occupied with work during the day, it seems that the same challenge in connectivity is going to persist for the next couple of months as well.
12/1/24, 8:35 PM - Dev Edoofa: With that being said, what I can do right now to solve this constraint is give you the freedom to choose the time slot for our sessions over the next 10 days [till 20th January]. This way, we can align it with our availability as well and help you move forward and make progress in a streamlined manner. Could you please let me know at what time you would be available from Monday to Friday between 08:00 AM and 06:00 PM? This would help us factor in your input and find the right time for our sessions.

26/1/24, 8:50 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Tendai,

I am *Ms. Siddhi Singh, Admission Officer at Edoofa*. Recently I was having a discussion with the Academic Board. They highlighted  that you have not been able to proceed with your admission process in a timely manner, since your child is at school and you have been occupied with work. Hence, I pitched in that I will be able to help you out and take over your application profile so that together we can ensure a timely and smooth progress. Since my operational hours accommodate your timings more suitably, I will be assuming Mr. Dev’s duties as your admission officer. I am optimistic that together, we can pave the way for an auspicious beginning to your academic journey, resulting in the right career prospects and eventual success for both you and your family.

29/1/24, 3:35 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for introducing yourself ma'am. It is a pleasure to know you. Could you kindly confirm what the above receipt is in reference to?
29/1/24, 3:36 PM - +263 77 455 3293: Good afternoon ma'am The money deposited is for the *Edoofa Financial secure Plan*...... Previously discussed with Mr Shivjeet (You can check from Tendai's file).We had agreed that we are going to deposit $150 for the next 10 months with Edoofa.....Then  for the Next 4 months we will be guided to  open an FBC Mastercard Bank Account  here in Zimbabwe to help in Student VISA application and ......The amount has a charge of 12.5%...... so it was supposed to be $168.75.....Rounded off to $170... because of lack of change  from the our banks
29/1/24, 3:58 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for confirming the same to me.  For the current round of students, there are only 27 seats available for the students who can benefit from the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan. 

Since you have been one of the most dedicated students, and I see you have great aspirations, I wanted you to be a part of the same set of students and start with your future planning the right way.
29/1/24, 3:58 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Also, as this plan commences from the month of January, for the efficient implementation of this plan, we need to decide on a fixed date on which you will deposit $150 every month. This will provide you with the flexibility to align your finances accordingly.
29/1/24, 3:58 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Our complete focus is on providing students and parents with the best ways to avail themselves of these opportunities. We understand that every parent may not be able to make the payment on our specified date. Therefore, considering this situation, we allow them to decide the payment date according to their comfort. In light of the same, may I know the fixed date every month on which you will deposit $150?
29/1/24, 4:13 PM - +263 77 455 3293: Ok thank you ma'am our (Loveness and I ,We are both teachers)  pay dates are not fixed and we work in remote rural areas ie between 200 km to 300km to travel to town where there are banks.We only do this once a month .We are also given turns by administrators to go for pay to keep the institutions running.And sometimes there can be work related unplanned changes,and it is difficult to fix a specific date.Is it possible that we give a range like on or before such a date for example on or before the last day of the month.  Taking into consideration that some days fall on weekends and we have to do the deposits manually/physically
29/1/24, 4:42 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand that it can get difficult to travel so far. Thank you for sharing your situation with me. In such a case, what we can do is we can come to an agreement that you will be required to pay by the end of every month, i.e., 30th of every month. Since you are uncertain when you will be able to make the payment, this will give you flexibility to make the payment whenever it is feasible for you during the month. May I know if this is suitable for you?
29/1/24, 4:45 PM - +263 77 455 3293: Yes, thank you ma'am that will be okay
29/1/24, 5:21 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing these details, your commitment to securing a seat in this exclusive program is appreciated.
