I am *Ms. Siddhi Singh, Admission Officer at Edoofa*. Recently I was having a discussion with the Academic Board. They highlighted  that you have not been able to proceed with your admission process in a timely manner, since your child is at school and you have been occupied with work. Hence, I pitched in that I will be able to help you out and take over your application profile so that together we can ensure a timely and smooth progress. Since my operational hours accommodate your timings more suitably, I will be assuming the duties of your admission officer. I am optimistic that together, we can pave the way for an auspicious beginning to your academic journey, resulting in the right career prospects and eventual success for both you and your family.

27/1/24, 4:45 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you. I was going through Masket's application profile and it is my understanding that you have successfully completed the 2nd step of the admission cycle i.e., Statement of Purpose. May I know if I am correct?
27/1/24, 5:00 PM - +27 81 046 0123: Yes
27/1/24, 5:19 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for confirming that. I understand that Masket has school during the weekdays and you are occupied with work. In such a case, I want to ensure that our sessions are held in a timely and smooth manner so we can comfortably proceed with your application process. Could you kindly suggest a 1-hour slot between 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM when we can have our sessions?

27/1/24, 5:45 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that. In such a case, we will conclude today's conversation and reconnect on Monday at 1:00 PM to further discuss your application process. Until then, please take care and kindly extend my regards to your family as well.
27/1/24, 6:30 PM - +27 81 046 0123: Thanks for getting in touch with us, may you have a blessed evening further.
29/1/24, 1:10 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Masket. I hope you are all doing well. How has your day been going so far?
29/1/24, 3:07 PM - +27 81 046 0123: Good afternoon
29/1/24, 3:09 PM - +27 81 046 0123: I am sorry,i was so busy,I had to attend our Client Safety meeting.
29/1/24, 3:45 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. Thank you for letting me know of the same. May I know if you are currently available to proceed with our discussion?
29/1/24, 3:47 PM - +27 81 046 0123: Yes
29/1/24, 4:21 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Let us move forward with our discussion. To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is BA (Political Science)  and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2025. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
29/1/24, 4:22 PM - +27 81 046 0123: Yes
29/1/24, 5:00 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. Based on our experience of over 14 years and having assisted over 5000 students from different countries, we have realized that financial planning is the most important factor when a student plans for their higher education abroad.
29/1/24, 5:00 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am sure that you must be aware that 20-30% of students who are admitted into universities abroad are unable to fulfill their dream and come to India due to a lack of financial planning. The funds needed for booking flights, accommodation, and covering living expenses after arrival often become overwhelming, leading to the decision to defer their admission for a year. This, in turn, creates a gap in the child's education.
29/1/24, 5:00 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: To assist both students and parents in this regard, Edoofa Management has designed a Financial Secure Plan that aims to help you prepare for your higher educational finances without experiencing stress or last-minute rushes. I believe you must be wondering about the details of the same plan and how it helps the parents?
29/1/24, 5:04 PM - +27 81 046 0123: For sure
29/1/24, 5:31 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Edoofa Secure Plan is important for parents who have children joining the university for tertiary education in the next one to two years for several reasons:
29/1/24, 5:31 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 1. *Financial Preparedness:* The Edoofa Secure plan helps parents prepare financially for the costs after the Scholarship being offered so that they are not caught off guard.

2. *Reduced Financial Stress:* Having the Edoofa Secure Plan in place can significantly reduce the financial stress on you as parents when your child is about to enter university. Knowing that there is a dedicated fund for education expenses provides peace of mind.
29/1/24, 5:31 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 3. *Avoiding Debt*: Without proper savings, some parents may resort to taking out loans or accumulating credit card debt to cover their child's education costs. This Educational savings plan helps avoid the burden of debt and high-interest payments.

4. *Compound Interest:* By starting to save early and consistently contributing to the savings plan, parents can take advantage of compound interest, which can significantly increase the amount available for education expenses.
29/1/24, 5:31 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 5. *Flexibility and Control:* The Edoofa Secure savings plans allow parents to have greater control over their finances and how they allocate funds for their child's education. They can choose investment options that align with their risk tolerance and financial goals.

6. *Encouraging Responsibility*: Involving your child in the process of saving for their education teaches them financial responsibility and the value of higher education. It also motivates them to outperform in Academics.
29/1/24, 5:31 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 7. *Adapting to Unexpected Changes*: Life is full of surprises, and circumstances can change especially when there are political reforms changing each day impacting the Local Currency. Having an Edoofa Secure Plan allows parents to adapt to unexpected changes in their financial situation while still prioritizing their child's education.

8. *Peace of Mind:* Overall, having the Edoofa Secure plan provides parents with peace of mind, knowing that they are actively planning for their child's future and increasing the likelihood of providing them with a solid education.
29/1/24, 5:31 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, when you go through all the above benefits, I am sure you can see that the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan is an important financial tool for parents/students who are supposed to enter the university soon. 

It helps ensure that the financial aspect of tertiary education is well-managed, reduces stress, and allows parents to provide the best opportunities for their children without resorting to debt or financial hardship. Isn't this something you and your family also wish to have?
29/1/24, 6:05 PM - +27 81 046 0123: Waaaal this is a bridge to the other side 💃🏾💃🏾💃🏾, it makes it easier
30/1/24, 1:29 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Masket. I hope everything is well on your end. I was unable to respond to your last message yesterday as our operational hours had ended. However, I am glad that we can reconnect today. Before we proceed with our discussion today, I would like to check in on you and your family. How are you all doing today?
30/1/24, 2:35 PM - +27 81 046 0123: Good afternoon Ms Siddhi.
30/1/24, 2:37 PM - +27 81 046 0123: We are all fine, how are you in India this afternoon?
30/1/24, 3:06 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you are all fine. I am doing great, thank you for asking. In our last conversation, we were discussing the details about the Financial Secure Plan. Now that you have gone through the above points, do you want me to help you understand how the Edoofa Secure Plan works?
30/1/24, 3:08 PM - +27 81 046 0123: Yes ma'am, my you elaborate further so that we may have a detailed understanding of the whole concept
30/1/24, 3:46 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, as you are aware, we are currently in January 2024, and we have a good 20 months to plan for your finances before you start your university education in 2025.
30/1/24, 3:46 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: During the counseling session, you were informed that at Edoofa, we guarantee a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship on the tuition fees. Hence, the cost of education, including food and accommodation after the scholarship, would be between $2000-$3000, and it could be even less. Not more than that.
30/1/24, 3:46 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This means that if you can save $150 per month for the next 20 months, you will be able to save $3000. This amount is more than enough for the first year of university fees, including tuition fees (if any), food, and accommodation. I hope you agree with this?
30/1/24, 5:57 PM - +27 81 046 0123: Yes
30/1/24, 6:24 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I would love to continue with our discussion, however, my operational hours for the day have concluded. Let us reconnect tomorrow at our scheduled time to further discuss the admission process. I wish you a blessed day ahead!
30/1/24, 6:36 PM - +27 81 046 0123: Have a blessed evening too.
