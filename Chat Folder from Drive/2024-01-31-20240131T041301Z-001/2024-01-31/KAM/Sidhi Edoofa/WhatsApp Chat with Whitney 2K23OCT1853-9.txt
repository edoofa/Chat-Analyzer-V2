18/12/23, 12:32 PM - You joined using this group's invite link
19/12/23, 7:11 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening!

I hope you are doing well and blessed today. Please excuse me for the late reply. I was occupied with a university official today. May I know if you are available to proceed with our session?
21/12/23, 6:25 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening, dear parents and Whitney!

I hope this message finds you well and blessed. I was not able to get a response from your end the previous day. May I know if you are currently available so that we can proceed with the session for your admission process?
21/12/23, 6:28 PM - +263 77 374 9598: Evening Mr Shivjeet...... We are all well thank you

We assume that we have done with this Sessions and we are now doing EWYL Session with Ms Jasmine
21/12/23, 6:29 PM - +263 77 374 9598: But we have missed something here we can go ahead
21/12/23, 7:04 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for clearing that with me. With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey. we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*.
21/12/23, 7:04 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let us move forward with our discussion. To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is BA LLB and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2025. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
21/12/23, 7:47 PM - +263 77 374 9598: Very accurate Mr Shivjeet
21/12/23, 8:10 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. Based on our experience of over 14 years and having assisted over 5000 students from different countries, we have realized that financial planning is the most important factor when a student plans for his/her higher education abroad.
21/12/23, 8:10 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am sure that you must be aware that 20-30% of students who are admitted into universities abroad are unable to fulfill their dream and come to India due to a lack of financial planning. The funds needed for booking flights, accommodation, and covering living expenses after arrival often become overwhelming, leading to the decision to defer their admission for a year. This, in turn, creates a gap in the child's education.
21/12/23, 8:10 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: To assist both students and parents in this regard, Edoofa Management has designed a Financial Secure Plan that aims to help you prepare for your higher educational finances without experiencing stress or last-minute rushes. I believe you must be wondering about the details of the same plan and how it helps the parents?
27/12/23, 7:45 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening dear parents and Whitney. I hope this message finds you well and blessed. 

It has been a while. May I know if you are now ready to proceed with the session for your admission process?
27/12/23, 7:46 PM - +263 77 374 9598: Evening ...yes we can proceed
27/12/23, 7:59 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. In relation to this, I am now sharing you with the secure plan.
27/12/23, 7:59 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Edoofa Secure Plan is important for parents who have children joining the university for tertiary education in the next one to two years for several reasons:

*Financial Preparedness:* The Edoofa Secure plan helps parents prepare financially for the costs after the Scholarship being offered so that they are not caught off guard.

*Reduced Financial Stress:* Having the Edoofa Secure Plan in place can significantly reduce the financial stress on you as parents when your child is about to enter university. Knowing that there is a dedicated fund for education expenses provides peace of mind.

*Avoiding Debt*: Without proper savings, some parents may resort to taking out loans or accumulating credit card debt to cover their child's education costs. This Educational savings plan helps avoid the burden of debt and high-interest payments.

*Compound Interest:* By starting to save early and consistently contributing to the savings plan, parents can take advantage of compound interest, which can significantly increase the amount available for education expenses.

*Flexibility and Control:* The Edoofa Secure savings plans allow parents to have greater control over their finances and how they allocate funds for their child's education. They can choose investment options that align with their risk tolerance and financial goals.
27/12/23, 8:00 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Encouraging Responsibility*: Involving your child in the process of saving for their education teaches them financial responsibility and the value of higher education. It also motivates them to outperform in Academics.

*Adapting to Unexpected Changes*: Life is full of surprises, and circumstances can change especially when there are political reforms changing each day impacting the Local Currency. Having an Edoofa Secure Plan allows parents to adapt to unexpected changes in their financial situation while still prioritizing their child's education.

*Peace of Mind:* Overall, having the Edoofa Secure plan provides parents with peace of mind, knowing that they are actively planning for their child's future and increasing the likelihood of providing them with a solid education.
27/12/23, 8:00 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, when you go through all the above benefits, I am sure you can see that the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan is an important financial tool for parents/students who are supposed to enter the university soon. 

It helps ensure that the financial aspect of tertiary education is well-managed, reduces stress, and allows parents to provide the best opportunities for their children without resorting to debt or financial hardship. Isn't this something you and your family also wish to have?
27/12/23, 8:02 PM - +263 77 374 9598: Indeed it's a good plan
27/12/23, 8:18 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through the above points, do you want me to help you understand how the Edoofa Secure Plan works?
27/12/23, 8:19 PM - +263 77 374 9598: Yes you can
27/12/23, 8:20 PM - +263 77 374 9598: Briefly go through
27/12/23, 8:33 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through the above points, do you want me to help you understand how the Edoofa Secure Plan works?
27/12/23, 8:34 PM - +263 77 374 9598: Yes
27/12/23, 8:35 PM - +263 77 374 9598: You can help me
27/12/23, 8:36 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, as you are aware, we are currently in December 2023, and we have a good 20-21 months to plan for your finances before you start your university education in 2025.
27/12/23, 8:36 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: During the counseling session, you were informed that at Edoofa, we guarantee a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship on the tuition fees. Hence, the cost of education, including food and accommodation after the scholarship, would be between $1200-$1800, and it could be even less. Not more than that. <This message was edited>
27/12/23, 8:36 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: This means that if you can save $150 per month for the next 20 months, you will be able to save $3000. This amount is more than enough for the first year of university fees, including tuition fees (if any), food, and accommodation. I hope you agree with this?
27/12/23, 8:38 PM - +263 77 374 9598: Yes l agree
27/12/23, 8:41 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Right, this means that by the time you would be in India, you would have already saved the $3000 that will cover the first-year fee.
27/12/23, 8:41 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, in these next 20 months, I am sure you would also be engaged in the EWYL program, and if you secure a minimum of $1000 in 20 months, that means the fees for 1.5 years are already secured.
27/12/23, 8:41 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, for a 3-year course, if we follow the same approach for the remaining 1.5 years, the educational journey for the student and the financial journey for the parent will be easy and smooth. I believe you must be able to see this perspective?
27/12/23, 8:44 PM - +263 77 374 9598: Yaah it will be much easier
27/12/23, 8:44 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. With that said, there is also another benefit, I am sure being in Zimbabwe you know how drastically the exchange rate fluctuates.
27/12/23, 8:44 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: If you are buying a dollar today, you might be spending 7000 bonds, but if you buy a dollar after a month, the rate would be different.
27/12/23, 8:44 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Also, even if you choose to buy dollars every month and save at your home, it is not safe since there is news of robbery, and mugging every day.
27/12/23, 8:45 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: In that case, you will opt to save in the Bank, but again we know that savings in the Bank require a Nostro Account which means you have to pay the bank to keep your money safe, right?
27/12/23, 8:46 PM - +263 77 374 9598: Yahhh
27/12/23, 8:47 PM - +263 77 374 9598: That's true
27/12/23, 8:57 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is great to hear, considering these constraints, Edoofa Management has decided to help the parents and students prepare for the journey way ahead of time by helping them save money with Edoofa without any addional charges but rather saving additional money as well. Do you want me to explain how this has been achieved?
27/12/23, 9:15 PM - +263 77 374 9598: Yes you can explain
28/12/23, 12:08 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon dear parents and Whitney. I hope this message finds you well and blessed. 

I was not able to further connect with you as my available hours have ended. Hence, I would like to continue our session on our usual time which is 6:00 PM
28/12/23, 12:10 PM - +263 77 374 9598: Afternoon.... noted
28/12/23, 6:09 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening!

I hope you are having a wonderful evening with your family as we are approaching a New Year. May I know if you are ready to proceed with the session for the admission process?
28/12/23, 6:42 PM - +263 77 374 9598: Yes you can... evening
28/12/23, 8:06 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Under the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan, a parent has to deposit a small amount of money which is $150 every month for the next 10 months. That means, in 10 months, the money saved will be $1500.
28/12/23, 8:07 PM - +263 77 374 9598: Ok...
28/12/23, 8:20 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Imagine you paying $15 every month to the Bank of Zimbabwe to keep your money safe, and here Edoofa is paying you $15 every month to keep your money safe. Now, you must be wondering, why only for 10 months and not for 20 months, right?
29/12/23, 6:02 AM - +263 77 374 9598: Can you plz explain in detail lm not getting you....were you are saying Edoofa wll pay me   $15 every month
29/12/23, 6:13 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening!

I hope you are doing well today. May I know if you are currently available to proceed with the session for the admission process?
29/12/23, 6:14 PM - +263 77 374 9598: I'm available...you can proceed
29/12/23, 6:15 PM - +263 77 374 9598: Evening
29/12/23, 6:33 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is correct, we will be paying the bank not for your safety of the amout.
29/12/23, 6:36 PM - +263 77 374 9598: Wanted you to explain here ....how would you pay me for keeping my money
29/12/23, 6:37 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: We will be paying the bank not to you directly for your safety of the amount.
29/12/23, 7:03 PM - +263 77 374 9598: Owkey....noted
29/12/23, 7:04 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: If you see the bigger picture, you will realize that the reason is quite simple. Upon the completion of the 10 installments, the Edoofa Admissions team will initiate the Child’s Admission Process by applying early to the universities to secure their scholarship and their university seat.
29/12/23, 7:04 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Reserving seats earlier increases the chances of obtaining a maximum scholarship. A higher scholarship means lower fees, and by securing the seat, you will be entitled to pay the fees as per the old fee structure of the university, not the new one implemented in January 2025. Furthermore, when applying to the universities, you will receive an offer letter or a letter of intent detailing the fees, scholarship, and registration fee.
29/12/23, 7:04 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: As explained during the enrollment process, the registration fee is a portion of your first-year university fee, paid to reserve the seat. It ranges from $500-$1000 and is not an additional fee. 

From the $1500 you saved with Edoofa, the registration fee will be paid to the university, securing the seat. For instance, if the registration fee is $1000, Edoofa will pay $1000 from the $1500 saved in 10 months. The updated balance with Edoofa will be $500, which will be paid to the university upon your arrival in India.
29/12/23, 7:04 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: This eases the financial burden on the parent, as there is no immediate payment required upon the student's arrival. The $500 saved will cover the remaining fees for the semester/year, as specified in the offer letter from the university. What are your thoughts on this?
29/12/23, 7:07 PM - +263 77 374 9598: It's a good idea
29/12/23, 7:32 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to see that we are together so far. With this plan for the next 10 months, I am sure you must be wondering what will happen in the next 10 months, considering you have already secured your scholarship seat with the university due to your hard work in the first 10 months. Is my understanding correct?
29/12/23, 7:34 PM - +263 77 374 9598: Yes
29/12/23, 7:36 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let me help you with that as well. In the 11th month, you will be guided to open an FBC Mastercard bank account in Zimbabwe with a deposit of $150. The reason for this is that when you apply for your student Visa, the Embassy asks for a Bank Statement, and this account will serve that purpose.
29/12/23, 7:37 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: We understand it might be expensive if you deposit another $1500 for the remaining 10 months in FB  Bank Zimbabwe, so to avoid the same challenges, we have designed the plan accordingly. You will only be depositing for the 11th, 12th, 13th, and 14th month, which is 4 months.
29/12/23, 7:37 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once the 4 months are completed, our Department of Student Welfare (DSW) team will assist you with your visa process. The bank statement will act as one of the required documents, and once you receive the visa, you can withdraw the amount from FBC and book the flight ticket. This will help you utilize the money as well. How does it sound?
29/12/23, 7:46 PM - +263 77 374 9598: So you are saying if l deposit 150x10 that 1500 
1000 wll be for registration fee for securing the place at  university and 500 wll part of fees for the first semester is this correct
29/12/23, 7:49 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is absolutely correct.
29/12/23, 7:50 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, from the 16th Month till the 20th month, considering it is a 6-month window, you can again continue depositing the money ($150) with Edoofa which can be used in the fee as and when required or you can decide to save this $900 of these 6 months with you as well. This is something which you are free to choose. I hope you have understood the financial secure plan now?
29/12/23, 7:53 PM - +263 77 374 9598: So for visa process that's were you are saying wll deposit 150x4mnth that will be 600usd for visa process
29/12/23, 8:02 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: That will be for the VISA and the plane ticket included.
29/12/23, 8:03 PM - +263 77 374 9598: Owkey...noted
29/12/23, 9:30 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
30/12/23, 9:11 AM - +263 77 374 9598: I appreciate your Best wishes Mr Shivjeet.....thank you so much may also God bless you
2/1/24, 6:36 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Eevning dear parent and my dear student!

I hope you had your wonderful holidays with your loved ones. As we embark on a furitful fresh new year. May I know if you are now reay to proceed with the session for the admisison process for today?
2/1/24, 6:38 PM - +263 77 374 9598: Yes l am
2/1/24, 7:07 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: That's great. Now that you have all the information, I want you to take some time and discuss the financial security plan with your family members. Help them understand its importance and details. Once you're done, we can reconnect, have a discussion, and address any queries you may have. After resolving your concerns, I'll guide you through starting your financial security plan. 

While most students can discuss this with their parents the same day, I understand everyone is different. Could you let me know by when you think you'll have the discussion with your parents? This way, we can schedule our next session accordingly.
2/1/24, 7:22 PM - +263 77 374 9598: By end of day tomorrow
2/1/24, 7:35 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: That's perfectly fine. In that case, we will conclude today's conversation, and I will connect with you on tomorrow to resume our discussion. In the meantime, I hope you'll have a detailed discussion with your family and jot down any questions or thoughts you have regarding the Financial Secure plan.

Wishing you a good day ahead, and please extend our regards to your family.
2/1/24, 7:36 PM - +263 77 374 9598: Noted... thank you
3/1/24, 6:05 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening!

I hope you are doing well and blessed. May I know if you are currently available to proceed with the session?
3/1/24, 6:08 PM - +263 77 374 9598: Evening...yes
3/1/24, 6:23 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. May I know if you had the time to discuss the plan with your family?
3/1/24, 6:27 PM - +263 77 374 9598: Yes we have
3/1/24, 7:34 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. May I know how did the discussion went by?
6/1/24, 11:57 AM - Shivjeet Edoofa added Dev Edoofa
6/1/24, 12:30 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, Parents of Whitney,

6/1/24, 12:30 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: In the same spirit, I would like to share that I am embarking on a journey as I prepare myself to pursue my doctorate and take a step forward in my academic pursuits. This transition marks a significant chapter in my life as I will be bidding farewell to the cherished moments at the Admissions Team in Edoofa.

Over the past year, having the privilege of supporting numerous students, including you, in your pursuit of higher education has been truly rewarding. Witnessing our students thrive and excel in their dream universities and colleges has brought immense satisfaction.

9/1/24, 9:47 PM - Dev Edoofa: In the past few days, I had an in-depth discussion with Mr. Shivjeet and had the opportunity to review your scholarship application file in our records.

Upon reviewing your application file, I was both impressed and reassured to assist you in achieving these goals here in India, which will unlock doors to incredible opportunities in the future.
9/1/24, 9:47 PM - Dev Edoofa: Before we get into the specifics of your admission journey and talk about your admission process, I would like to share an exciting milestone that India as a country achieved within the first week of 2024 – the successful India's Chandrayaan-3 Engine Test. This accomplishment is responsible for the third lunar mission, aiming to land a rover on the Moon's south polar region and conduct scientific studies that could check Moon's viability to sustain life. It signifies a significant scientific advancement, laying the groundwork for future progress.
9/1/24, 9:47 PM - Dev Edoofa: This achievement has not only pushed boundaries but also inspired young minds all over the world to pursue their dreams. On the same note, I wanted to extend my heartiest wishes for the New Year to you and your family and check in to see how you and your family started your year?

I am glad to know that you had a great start to the year and I hope you are excited for the new day and most importantly the new year as well. @263773749598 , the new year brings about a transformative mindset in us which may not emphasize immediate changes but a change in the direction that you believe is needed.

If I talk about myself, I have made a resolution to bring more humility in myself and bring about a change in my perspective to be a better version of myself all while ensuring that I help all of our students to achieve their educational goals. With that said, I would like to know what aspirations or a change in your approach towards life you wish to achieve?

We will be able to help you only if we can connect timely and have healthy discussions.
13/1/24, 10:04 AM - Dev Edoofa: Now, this is something I want to inform you all that the agenda for the discussions, that we are going to have, is to help you all understand the process you will undertake for his university admission journey and what your family will be experiencing with the Edoofa Scholarship Program over the next one and a half years. However, since you are going to be occupied with school and your parents are occupied with work during the day, it seems that the same challenge in connectivity is going to persist for the next couple of months as well.
13/1/24, 10:04 AM - Dev Edoofa: With that being said, what I can do right now to solve this constraint is give you the freedom to choose the time slot for our sessions over the next 10 days [till 20th January]. This way, we can align it with our availability as well and help you move forward and make progress in a streamlined manner. Could you please let me know at what time you would be available from Monday to Friday between 08:00 AM and 06:00 PM? This would help us factor in your input and find the right time for our sessions.
13/1/24, 7:47 PM - +263 77 374 9598: Evening from 1:00pm to 3:00pm

26/1/24, 8:59 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Whitney,

I am *Ms. Siddhi Singh, Admission Officer at Edoofa*. Recently I was having a discussion with the Academic Board. They highlighted  that you have not been able to proceed with your admission process in a timely manner, since your child is at school and you have been occupied with work. Hence, I pitched in that I will be able to help you out and take over your application profile so that together we can ensure a timely and smooth progress. Since my operational hours accommodate your timings more suitably, I will be assuming the duties of your admission officer. I am optimistic that together, we can pave the way for an auspicious beginning to your academic journey, resulting in the right career prospects and eventual success for both you and your family.
26/1/24, 8:59 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>

29/1/24, 1:14 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for confirming that. I was going through Whitney's application profile and it is my understanding that you have successfully been introduced to Edoofa's Financial Secure Plan. May I know if I am correct?
29/1/24, 1:16 PM - +263 77 374 9598: Yes l have been introduced part of it we haven't finished
29/1/24, 1:37 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. Thank you for letting me know of the same. May I know which aspect do you need more clarity on?
29/1/24, 1:44 PM - +263 77 374 9598: According to my understanding ...Mr Shivjeet say we can do a payment plan that covers visa and freight fares and the remaining will cover part of fees and he explained that we can pay 150 per month
29/1/24, 1:44 PM - +263 77 374 9598: So may l know the account that wl use to deposit the money and also if l can not afford to deposit every month but stil lw afford to pay let's say a certain amount after every three months
29/1/24, 1:53 PM - +263 77 374 9598: Just making sure that lw deposit the ful amount that you need within your stated period
29/1/24, 2:26 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: You may use your bank account to make the payment or alternate methods will be offered to you. To address your second query, if you wish to deposit an amount every month but you think that you might not be able to deposit a fixed amount every month, in such a case we will require you to provide us with a monthly plan stating the amount you will be able to deposit every month for the next 10 months.
29/1/24, 2:27 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Our end goal is to make sure that towards the end of the 10 months, we are able to save $1500 for Whitney's higher education.
29/1/24, 2:36 PM - +263 77 374 9598: Noted with thanks
29/1/24, 2:36 PM - +263 77 374 9598: Well noted
29/1/24, 2:39 PM - +263 77 374 9598: For example l have an account with standard chartered Bank so does it means that lw deposit my money in that account every month
29/1/24, 2:39 PM - +263 77 374 9598: And what alternative methods wll be made besides using my account if so
29/1/24, 2:53 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I believe there has been a misunderstanding. You can use your bank account to transfer the amount to Edoofa, and if you wish to use another payment method other than bank transfer, the same can be offered by us as well.
29/1/24, 2:54 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
29/1/24, 3:24 PM - +263 77 374 9598: Well noted then
29/1/24, 3:25 PM - +263 77 374 9598: Yes we are in Harare
29/1/24, 3:43 PM - +263 77 374 9598: So may l know when should l start depositing the money
29/1/24, 4:07 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
29/1/24, 4:08 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
29/1/24, 4:08 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
29/1/24, 4:08 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.
29/1/24, 4:08 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
29/1/24, 4:08 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: For the current round of students, there are only 27 seats available for the students who can benefit from the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan. 

Since you have been one of the most dedicated students, and I see you have great aspirations, I wanted you to be a part of the same set of students and start with your future planning the right way.

Also, as this plan commences from the month of January, for the efficient implementation of this plan, we need to decide on a fixed date on which you will deposit $150 every month. This will provide you with the flexibility to align your finances accordingly.
29/1/24, 4:08 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Our complete focus is on providing students and parents with the best ways to avail themselves of these opportunities. We understand that every parent may not be able to make the payment on our specified date. Therefore, considering this situation, we allow them to decide the payment date according to their comfort. In light of the same, may I know the fixed date every month on which you will deposit $150?
29/1/24, 4:15 PM - +263 77 374 9598: Alright...so making payment through Mr Rajan does also includes a 7%transfer rate and is this is to be added on top of 150 usd
29/1/24, 4:15 PM - +263 77 374 9598: Well noted
29/1/24, 4:17 PM - +263 77 374 9598: Wll be able to pay on the 1st of each month
29/1/24, 4:53 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Yes, that is indeed correct.
29/1/24, 4:53 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing these details, your commitment to securing a seat in this exclusive program is appreciated.
