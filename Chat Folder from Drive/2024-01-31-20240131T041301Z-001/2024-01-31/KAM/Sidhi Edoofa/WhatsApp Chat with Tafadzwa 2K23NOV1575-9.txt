*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
28/12/23, 8:32 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.

27/1/24, 8:32 PM - +263 71 544 0530: Good evening Miss Siddhi Singh. Sorry for not being able to be available for the session. There was a power cut in my area
29/1/24, 2:01 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Tafadzwa. I hope you are all doing well. How has your day been going so far?
29/1/24, 2:17 PM - +263 77 246 9142: Good afternoon Ma'am. The day has been fine so far
29/1/24, 2:45 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to know that. During our last conversation, we discussed how you have gone through the videos with Edoofa's founders' message. Could you kindly share a brief understanding of the same?
29/1/24, 2:58 PM - +263 77 246 9142: Certainly. I can do that
29/1/24, 3:11 PM - +263 77 246 9142: The videos cover a wide range of issues that include the Edoofa scholarship program and the process of earning credits.

The vision and mission of the program is also given so as the attributes expected of the prospective students

Universities under the Edoofa scholarship program are also discuss ed

The SOP...this one was new to me Statement of Purpose. I am still to adopt it as the abbreviation SOP means Standard Operating Procedure in the industry I work
29/1/24, 3:46 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Brilliant. I am glad to know that you were able to go through the videos so thoroughly and were able to grasp the founders' message. Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  I hope you were able to follow through with this?
29/1/24, 4:06 PM - +263 77 246 9142: I understand the SOP as a subjective document to convince the Admissions team so as the prospective university on why a student should purse program chosen. It will highlight skills, strengths and progress in academic studies
29/1/24, 4:28 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is very correct. Glad to hear that. Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by tomorrow before our session.
29/1/24, 4:28 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

29/1/24, 4:29 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Once you share these documents and complete the two tasks that have been provided to you, we will have completed the second step of your university admission process.

29/1/24, 4:31 PM - +263 77 246 9142: We will go through this in the evening. Hopefully we will have Tafadzwa s input also. I will now be traveling going home from 1630hrs but my wife will be online if there is still more for today. <This message was edited>

30/1/24, 2:30 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Tafadzwa. I hope everything is well on your end. How are you all doing today?
30/1/24, 2:57 PM - +263 77 246 9142: Good afternoon Ma'am. We all fine, thank you for checking on us! How are you. Sorry for late response I was in a meeting at work but now we can proceed
30/1/24, 3:01 PM - +263 77 246 9142: Reference to the outstanding task, Tafadzwa is still working on the task and still to provide answers to the questions you send yesterday. She will indicate approximate completion date in the evening.
30/1/24, 3:32 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. In such a case, I will be waiting for Tafadzwa to send in the responses, and in the meanwhile we may proceed with our discussion.
30/1/24, 3:32 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Let us move forward with our discussion. To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is BA LLB and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2025. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
30/1/24, 3:45 PM - +263 77 246 9142: This information is very correct
30/1/24, 4:30 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. Based on our experience of over 14 years and having assisted over 5000 students from different countries, we have realized that financial planning is the most important factor when a student plans for their higher education abroad.
30/1/24, 4:30 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am sure that you must be aware that 20-30% of students who are admitted into universities abroad are unable to fulfill their dream and come to India due to a lack of financial planning. The funds needed for booking flights, accommodation, and covering living expenses after arrival often become overwhelming, leading to the decision to defer their admission for a year. This, in turn, creates a gap in the child's education.
30/1/24, 4:30 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: To assist both students and parents in this regard, Edoofa Management has designed a Financial Secure Plan that aims to help you prepare for your higher educational finances without experiencing stress or last-minute rushes. I believe you must be wondering about the details of the same plan and how it helps the parents?
30/1/24, 4:40 PM - +263 77 246 9142: WE will be grateful to get the details of this financial plan to help us prepare
30/1/24, 5:35 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Edoofa Secure Plan is important for parents who have children joining the university for tertiary education in the next one to two years for several reasons:
30/1/24, 5:35 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 1. *Financial Preparedness:* The Edoofa Secure plan helps parents prepare financially for the costs after the Scholarship being offered so that they are not caught off guard.

2. *Reduced Financial Stress:* Having the Edoofa Secure Plan in place can significantly reduce the financial stress on you as parents when your child is about to enter university. Knowing that there is a dedicated fund for education expenses provides peace of mind.
30/1/24, 5:35 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 3. *Avoiding Debt*: Without proper savings, some parents may resort to taking out loans or accumulating credit card debt to cover their child's education costs. This Educational savings plan helps avoid the burden of debt and high-interest payments.

4. *Compound Interest:* By starting to save early and consistently contributing to the savings plan, parents can take advantage of compound interest, which can significantly increase the amount available for education expenses.
30/1/24, 5:35 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 5. *Flexibility and Control:* The Edoofa Secure savings plans allow parents to have greater control over their finances and how they allocate funds for their child's education. They can choose investment options that align with their risk tolerance and financial goals.

6. *Encouraging Responsibility*: Involving your child in the process of saving for their education teaches them financial responsibility and the value of higher education. It also motivates them to outperform in Academics.
30/1/24, 5:35 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 7. *Adapting to Unexpected Changes*: Life is full of surprises, and circumstances can change especially when there are political reforms changing each day impacting the Local Currency. Having an Edoofa Secure Plan allows parents to adapt to unexpected changes in their financial situation while still prioritizing their child's education.

8. *Peace of Mind:* Overall, having the Edoofa Secure plan provides parents with peace of mind, knowing that they are actively planning for their child's future and increasing the likelihood of providing them with a solid education.
30/1/24, 5:35 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, when you go through all the above benefits, I am sure you can see that the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan is an important financial tool for parents/students who are supposed to enter the university soon. 

It helps ensure that the financial aspect of tertiary education is well-managed, reduces stress, and allows parents to provide the best opportunities for their children without resorting to debt or financial hardship. Isn't this something you and your family also wish to have?
30/1/24, 5:57 PM - +263 77 532 6491: Good day .The financial secure plan we were aware of is EWYL program which Tafadzwa wish to participate in.
30/1/24, 6:24 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. I would love to continue with our discussion, however, my operational hours for the day have concluded. Let us reconnect tomorrow at our scheduled time to further discuss the admission process. I wish you a blessed day ahead!
