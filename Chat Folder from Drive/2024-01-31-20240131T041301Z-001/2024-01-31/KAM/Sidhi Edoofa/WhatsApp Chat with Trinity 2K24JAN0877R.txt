24/1/24, 10:55 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
24/1/24, 11:48 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: @263776140554 @263782894239 may I know if we are still connected?
24/1/24, 11:55 AM - +263 77 614 0554: Yes
24/1/24, 11:55 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for confirming that. May I know if you are clear with the first 2 steps of the admission cycle?
24/1/24, 11:59 AM - +263 77 614 0554: Yes
24/1/24, 12:01 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counselling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counselling session will take about 1 hour.
24/1/24, 12:01 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
24/1/24, 12:05 PM - +263 77 614 0554: Yes I am following
24/1/24, 12:08 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process, the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
24/1/24, 12:08 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
24/1/24, 12:11 PM - +263 77 614 0554: Yes
24/1/24, 12:14 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through all 6 steps, please feel free to share your thoughts and queries if you have any.
24/1/24, 12:18 PM - +263 77 614 0554: Ok let me go through again and back to you
24/1/24, 12:40 PM - +263 77 614 0554: Step number 5 
Are we going to pay that $500 to $1000 at the same time or time to time
24/1/24, 12:48 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: According to the university policy, you have to pay the registration amount of $500 to $1000, which is 15 days of receiving the offer letter for most universities. I hope this helps with your query?
24/1/24, 12:52 PM - +263 78 289 4239: Yes thank you
24/1/24, 12:55 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
24/1/24, 1:00 PM - +263 78 289 4239: Yes
24/1/24, 1:02 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
24/1/24, 1:03 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding during tomorrow’s session. You may take today’s time for the same. Until you are ready, shall we start with our discussion with me individually?

26/1/24, 12:10 PM - +263 77 623 5022: For my own understanding on these videos,  video 1 is on the message for enrolled students. 
They share two important qualities of successful Edoofians who had secured a maximum scholarship and earned scholarship credits. They show us the pictures of successful Edoofians and they are proud with  them since they fulfill their dreams. They also say, some people are not getting successful in their lives because they are not open minded. They emphasized that students must be open minded and fallow instructions as well .


Video 2
The founders of Edoofa also talk about the most important character that distinguishes a successful student from the rest of the crowd. 
They give us an example of a student from Ghana, who fallow all the instructions and fulfill his dreams. They also give us an example of Courage.Courage was open minded, he fallow all the instructions and because of that, he get scholarship  credits due to his qualities. 


Video 3
The third video is about schools, colleges and universities. 
Founders talk about their decade long journey of discovering these schools and the experiences that students are havingin these schools. 
They usually says, if you work very hard you can fulfill your dreams, which means hard work pays

Video 4
The fourth video is about the statement of purpose. 
They usually says, the most important step towards securing a good scholarship is to write a statement of purpose. 
A statement of purpose includes your vision, academic progress, why you have been chosen to study that particular course at that particular school.
The founders also encourage students to be resourceful

26/1/24, 2:03 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier.

29/1/24, 11:16 AM - +263 77 623 5022: Yes ,we go through  those messages but we were waiting for the session to reply
29/1/24, 11:22 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Since our conversation could not come to a conclusion before and you did not confirm a suitable timing for the same, hence we were not able to schedule our next session with you. However, I am glad that we can reconnect today and proceed with our discussion.
29/1/24, 11:22 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: May I know if you were able to go through the documents and were able to complete both the tasks?

Until then, please take care and have a blessed day ahead!
30/1/24, 9:43 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Trinity. I hope everything is well on your end. It has been over 10 days since we began the admission process, and since we are unable to connect with each other we are running behind schedule. Trinity's batchmates who began their admission process alongside have completed the process and are currently waiting for their offer letters. As Trinity's admission officer, I am a bit concerned about the timely completion of your admission cycle so that you do not miss out on this scholarship opportunity. May I know if you have been facing any challenges due to which it has not been possible on your end to connect with us?
30/1/24, 9:48 AM - +263 77 623 5022: Morning
30/1/24, 9:58 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: How are you doing today Trinity?
30/1/24, 10:00 AM - +263 77 623 5022: Im good
30/1/24, 10:42 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that Trinity. Could you kindly share a screenshot with me Trinity? In case you forgot to take one, you may revisit the link and take a screenshot of the screen and share the same.
30/1/24, 10:43 AM - +263 77 623 5022: Ok let me do so
30/1/24, 10:55 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know Trinity. I will be waiting for your response.
30/1/24, 11:21 AM - +263 77 623 5022: Sorry, our network is very  low so the link couldn't open but l promise once the network is active , l will do as you say , sorry for the delays
30/1/24, 11:53 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Very well, Trinity. In such a case, let us move forward with out discussion for today. However, before we do the same, I was going through your scholarship application file and noticed that you are supposed to make the payment of your remaining part of Edoofa Enrollment fee before 18 February 2024. Hence, I thought of sharing a gentle reminder with you and trying to understand how your preparation has been so far? Have you been able to align your preparations in the right direction?
30/1/24, 11:57 AM - +263 77 623 5022: Thank you very much for the reminder, we are busy preparing for that money
30/1/24, 12:04 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. We will reconnect with each other a few days before your due date to take a follow up on this and understand your preparations better.

In the meantime, let us move forward with our discussion. To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is BA LLB and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
30/1/24, 12:19 PM - +263 77 623 5022: Yes it is accurate
30/1/24, 12:19 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
30/1/24, 12:19 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
30/1/24, 12:19 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
30/1/24, 12:20 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
30/1/24, 12:22 PM - +263 77 623 5022: Yes it is not possible
30/1/24, 12:23 PM - +263 77 623 5022: Ok thank you for the information
30/1/24, 12:23 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
30/1/24, 12:23 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $1000. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalise their registration process.
30/1/24, 12:23 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counsellor has also discussed the registration fee during your counselling sessions, correct?
30/1/24, 12:28 PM - +263 77 623 5022: Yes , we discussed about it during our counselling sessions
30/1/24, 12:58 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $1200 - $1800 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
30/1/24, 1:01 PM - +263 77 623 5022: Yes we are
30/1/24, 1:45 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:
30/1/24, 1:46 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 1. *Tuition Fee*: $650 per annum
2. *Accommodation Fee*: $0 per annum (100% Sponsorship)
3. *Remaining Fee Components*: [Library Fee, Examination Fee, EDB and Book Bank, International Student Development Fund, 24-Hour WiFi Cost, Maintenance Fee, Water Bill, and Electricity Bill]: $1000 per annum

*Total Fee: Tuition Fee $650 + Accommodation Fee $0 + Remaining Fee Components $1000 = $1650 per annum.*
30/1/24, 1:46 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Registration Fee to be paid: $1000 (deadline within two weeks of issue of the offer letter, part of the university’s first-year fee and will be adjusted against the first-year cost of education $1650). I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?
30/1/24, 1:49 PM - +263 77 623 5022: Yes
30/1/24, 2:11 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $1000, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $1000 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $1650 as per the above example.
30/1/24, 2:13 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $1650 - $1000 = $650. This amount can be paid in two instalments of $325 each. The initial instalment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $325 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly instalments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
30/1/24, 2:22 PM - +263 77 623 5022: Ok, thank you for informing me such important things
30/1/24, 2:43 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
30/1/24, 2:43 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
30/1/24, 2:43 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
30/1/24, 2:59 PM - +263 77 623 5022: Ok
30/1/24, 3:29 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.
30/1/24, 3:29 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
30/1/24, 3:34 PM - +263 77 623 5022: No , l don't have any queries right now
30/1/24, 3:53 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Alright please, Now with this, we are done with step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.

It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one.
30/1/24, 3:53 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
30/1/24, 3:54 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
30/1/24, 3:56 PM - +263 77 623 5022: Yes we are exited
30/1/24, 3:57 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
30/1/24, 3:57 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavour for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received special news for the students of the 2024 admission intake. May I know if you are excited to know the news we have for you?
30/1/24, 4:02 PM - +263 77 623 5022: Im very exited to hear that
30/1/24, 4:48 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am happy to see that you are excited. After speaking with thousands of students and parents who completed their admission process before you, we realised that the current economic situation in African countries makes it a bit challenging for parents to pay the full registration fee at once.
30/1/24, 4:48 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: In response to the same challenge, we had a detailed discussion with the academic board and university official. As a result, we developed a solution to alleviate the financial burden of the parents specifically for the registration fee due of $500 to $1000. 

We at Edoofa are thrilled about this development, and I believe it will significantly help all of our students and their families. Are you aware of the solution?
30/1/24, 5:45 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I would love to continue with our discussion, however, my operational hours for the day have concluded. Let us reconnect tomorrow at our scheduled time to further discuss the admission process. I wish you a blessed day ahead!
30/1/24, 6:06 PM - +263 77 623 5022: Thank you very much, have a blessed night
