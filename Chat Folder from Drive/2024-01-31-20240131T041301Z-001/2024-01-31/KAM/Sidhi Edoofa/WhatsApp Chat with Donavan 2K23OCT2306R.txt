26/1/24, 9:19 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Donovan,

I am *Ms. Siddhi Singh, Admission Officer at Edoofa*. Recently I was having a discussion with the Academic Board. They highlighted  that you have not been able to proceed with your admission process in a timely manner, since your child is at school and you have been occupied with work. Hence, I pitched in that I will be able to help you out and take over your application profile so that together we can ensure a timely and smooth progress. Since my operational hours accommodate your timings more suitably, I will be assuming the duties of your admission officer. I am optimistic that together, we can pave the way for an auspicious beginning to your academic journey, resulting in the right career prospects and eventual success for both you and your family.

27/1/24, 5:40 PM - +263 78 132 1644: How are you all
27/1/24, 5:48 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: We are well. Thank you for asking. I understand that Donovan has school during the weekdays and you are occupied with work. In such a case, I want to ensure that our sessions are held in a timely and smooth manner so we can comfortably proceed with your application process. Could you kindly suggest a 1-hour slot between 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM when we can have our sessions?
27/1/24, 6:31 PM - +263 78 321 9879: I think 1300 to 1400 will be ohk because at school I dismiss at 1700 so that is the only time I can get in between the specified time

29/1/24, 9:43 AM - +263 78 132 1644: Good marning
29/1/24, 10:07 AM - +263 78 321 9879: Thank you
29/1/24, 1:12 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Donavan. I hope you are all doing well. How has your day been going so far?
29/1/24, 1:23 PM - +263 78 321 9879: It has not been bad at all
29/1/24, 1:44 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to know that. I was going through Donavan's application profile and it is my understanding that you have successfully completed the 2nd step of the admission cycle i.e., Statement of Purpose. May I know if I am correct?
29/1/24, 1:45 PM - +263 78 321 9879: Yes you are correct
29/1/24, 1:47 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Let us move forward with our discussion. To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is B.Tech (Biomedical Engineering) and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2025. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
29/1/24, 1:59 PM - +263 78 321 9879: Yes it is accurate
29/1/24, 2:30 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. Based on our experience of over 14 years and having assisted over 5000 students from different countries, we have realized that financial planning is the most important factor when a student plans for their higher education abroad.
29/1/24, 2:30 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am sure that you must be aware that 20-30% of students who are admitted into universities abroad are unable to fulfill their dream and come to India due to a lack of financial planning. The funds needed for booking flights, accommodation, and covering living expenses after arrival often become overwhelming, leading to the decision to defer their admission for a year. This, in turn, creates a gap in the child's education.
29/1/24, 2:30 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: To assist both students and parents in this regard, Edoofa Management has designed a Financial Secure Plan that aims to help you prepare for your higher educational finances without experiencing stress or last-minute rushes. I believe you must be wondering about the details of the same plan and how it helps the parents?
29/1/24, 3:21 PM - +263 78 321 9879: Yes I am
29/1/24, 3:49 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Edoofa Secure Plan is important for parents who have children joining the university for tertiary education in the next one to two years for several reasons:
29/1/24, 3:49 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 1. *Financial Preparedness:* The Edoofa Secure plan helps parents prepare financially for the costs after the Scholarship being offered so that they are not caught off guard.

2. *Reduced Financial Stress:* Having the Edoofa Secure Plan in place can significantly reduce the financial stress on you as parents when your child is about to enter university. Knowing that there is a dedicated fund for education expenses provides peace of mind.
29/1/24, 3:49 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 3. *Avoiding Debt*: Without proper savings, some parents may resort to taking out loans or accumulating credit card debt to cover their child's education costs. This Educational savings plan helps avoid the burden of debt and high-interest payments.

4. *Compound Interest:* By starting to save early and consistently contributing to the savings plan, parents can take advantage of compound interest, which can significantly increase the amount available for education expenses.
29/1/24, 3:49 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 5. *Flexibility and Control:* The Edoofa Secure savings plans allow parents to have greater control over their finances and how they allocate funds for their child's education. They can choose investment options that align with their risk tolerance and financial goals.

6. *Encouraging Responsibility*: Involving your child in the process of saving for their education teaches them financial responsibility and the value of higher education. It also motivates them to outperform in Academics.
29/1/24, 3:49 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 7. *Adapting to Unexpected Changes*: Life is full of surprises, and circumstances can change especially when there are political reforms changing each day impacting the Local Currency. Having an Edoofa Secure Plan allows parents to adapt to unexpected changes in their financial situation while still prioritizing their child's education.

8. *Peace of Mind:* Overall, having the Edoofa Secure plan provides parents with peace of mind, knowing that they are actively planning for their child's future and increasing the likelihood of providing them with a solid education.
29/1/24, 3:49 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, when you go through all the above benefits, I am sure you can see that the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan is an important financial tool for parents/students who are supposed to enter the university soon. 

It helps ensure that the financial aspect of tertiary education is well-managed, reduces stress, and allows parents to provide the best opportunities for their children without resorting to debt or financial hardship. Isn't this something you and your family also wish to have?
29/1/24, 5:02 PM - +263 78 321 9879: Indeed it is
29/1/24, 5:29 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through the above points, do you want me to help you understand how the Edoofa Secure Plan works?
29/1/24, 5:58 PM - +263 78 132 1644: You are welcome
29/1/24, 6:01 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: As much as I would like to continue with our discussion, since my operational hours for the day have already concluded and I have had a long day, I would like to reconnect with you tomorrow at our scheduled time to further discuss the admission process. Until then, please take care and have a blessed day ahead!
29/1/24, 6:30 PM - +263 78 321 9879: Yes please
29/1/24, 8:48 PM - +263 78 132 1644: Thank you
30/1/24, 1:37 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Donavan. I hope everything is well on your end. Before we proceed with our discussion today, I would like to check in on you and your family. How are you all doing today?
30/1/24, 1:46 PM - +263 78 321 9879: I am doing well. Thank you for checking
30/1/24, 1:47 PM - +263 78 132 1644: We are doing very well
30/1/24, 2:11 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you are all doing well. During our previous interaction, we were discussing how Edoofa's Financial Secure Plan works. As you are aware, we are currently in January 2024, and we have a good 20 months to plan for your finances before you start your university education in 2025.
30/1/24, 2:11 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: During the counseling session, you were informed that at Edoofa, we guarantee a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship on the tuition fees. Hence, the cost of education, including food and accommodation after the scholarship, would be between $2000-$3000, and it could be even less. Not more than that.
30/1/24, 2:11 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This means that if you can save $150 per month for the next 20 months, you will be able to save $3000. This amount is more than enough for the first year of university fees, including tuition fees (if any), food, and accommodation. I hope you agree with this?
30/1/24, 2:37 PM - +263 78 321 9879: Yes I do
30/1/24, 3:07 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Right, this means that by the time you would be in India, you would have already saved the $3000 that will cover the first-year fee.
30/1/24, 3:07 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, in these next 20 months, I am sure you would also be engaged in the EWYL program, and if you secure a minimum of $1000 in 20 months, that means the fees for 1.5 years are already secured.
30/1/24, 3:07 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, for a 3-year course, if we follow the same approach for the remaining 1.5 years, the educational journey for the student and the financial journey for the parent will be easy and smooth. I believe you must be able to see this perspective?
30/1/24, 3:23 PM - +263 78 132 1644: Yes we are agree
30/1/24, 3:26 PM - +263 78 132 1644: Well understood
30/1/24, 3:52 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. With that said, there is also another benefit, I am sure being in Zimbabwe you know how drastically the exchange rate fluctuates.
30/1/24, 3:52 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: If you are buying a dollar today, you might be spending 7000 bonds, but if you buy a dollar after a month, the rate would be different.
30/1/24, 3:52 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Also, even if you choose to buy dollars every month and save at your home, it is not safe since there is news of robbery, and mugging every day.
30/1/24, 3:52 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: In that case, you will opt to save in the Bank, but again we know that savings in the Bank require a Nostro Account which means you have to pay the bank to keep your money safe, right?
30/1/24, 4:26 PM - +263 78 132 1644: We are together
30/1/24, 5:19 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is great to hear, considering these constraints, Edoofa Management has decided to help the parents and students prepare for the journey way ahead of time by helping them save money with Edoofa without any additional charges but rather saving additional money as well. Do you want me to explain how this has been achieved?
30/1/24, 5:20 PM - +263 78 321 9879: Yes please
30/1/24, 5:34 PM - +263 78 132 1644: Yes
30/1/24, 6:16 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I would love to continue with our discussion, however, my operational hours for the day have concluded. Let us reconnect tomorrow at our scheduled time to further discuss the Financial Secure Plan. I wish you a blessed day ahead! <This message was edited>
