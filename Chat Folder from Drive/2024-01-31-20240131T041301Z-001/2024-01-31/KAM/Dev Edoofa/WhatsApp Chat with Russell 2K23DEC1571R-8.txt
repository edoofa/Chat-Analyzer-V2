26/12/23, 1:16 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to know that you are clear about the purpose of the two WhatsApp groups and it's reassuring to hear this from your end. I also had a recent conversation with your counselor, during which he provided me with some insights into your academic background and career aspirations. I must commend you as a family, you must take great pride in your achievements and be dedicated to ensuring your access to the finest opportunities to launch your career.

Speaking of valuable opportunities, I am also curious to learn more about your counseling session with your counselor and to understand which aspects of the Edoofa Scholarship Program have particularly impressed you thus far. Can you share this with me?

26/12/23, 1:23 PM - +263 71 399 6403: I was inspired by the Edoofa vision of offering accessible and affordable education for all, the EWYL program which offers students a chance to reduce their tuition fees and gain valuable job skills 
And finally  the dedication which is manifested in the Edoofa student care team to guide their students in the path  which leads to success
26/12/23, 1:24 PM - Dev Edoofa: Earn while you Learn program provides the opportunity to the hardworking students to self-finance their higher education on top of the scholarship provided in the Edoofa scholarship program.

This program also assists the students to have a finesse on skills that are pre-requisites before venturing into any field and climb the ladder of success.

26/12/23, 1:58 PM - Dev Edoofa: Amazing. In addition to these forms, we kindly request the following documents for your university application preparation:

1. A-Level Results/Letter of Recommendation/Statement of Entry (A-Level).
2. O-Level Results.
3. Identity proof (International Travelling Passport or National ID or Birth Certificate).
26/12/23, 1:59 PM - Dev Edoofa: Here are some key points to consider when requesting the letter from your school:

1. *Visit Your School*: Approach your school administration or the designated authority for issuing such letters.

2. *Provide Necessary Information*: Ensure that the drafted letter includes essential details such as your identity as a student of the school, your subject combination for A Level exams, and your intention to sit for the exams this academic year.

3. *Printing and Signing*: Request the school to print the letter on official letterhead and have it signed/stamped by the appropriate authority.

4. *Include Authority Details*: Ensure that the letter contains the details of the signing authority, including their full name, contact number, and email ID.
26/12/23, 1:59 PM - Dev Edoofa: This letter of recommendation is a crucial document that will support your application process. The Edoofa Academic Board will use those details to reach out to your school authorities and verify the recommendation letter before adding it to your scholarship application and hence I would like to enquire by when will you be able to share the same document with us?
26/12/23, 2:09 PM - +263 71 399 6403: By   April in 2024  when schools will close
26/12/23, 2:13 PM - +263 71 399 6403: But immediately when  the schools open l should request for the document to be produced
26/12/23, 2:15 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am having a little problem understanding this, may I please know that if you will be able to provide the letter of recommendation by April 2024 or the A-level results by  April 2024?
26/12/23, 2:18 PM - +263 71 399 6403: I mean the letter of recommendation
The A level results will be released in  February 2025
26/12/23, 2:24 PM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know and I have taken a note of it.
But April is five months away and other students are able to get their Letter of Recommendation within a single day, so please let me know, if you are facing any issue or have a particular reason for the delay?
26/12/23, 2:27 PM - +263 71 399 6403: The challenge  is on how to send the letter to you since cellphones are not allowed at school
26/12/23, 2:33 PM - +263 71 399 6403: What l can do is to send the letter to my mother from a school teacher's cellphone so that she can forward it to you
26/12/23, 2:36 PM - Dev Edoofa: You may get it printed from the school itself. It would not require you to use cellphone.
26/12/23, 2:36 PM - Dev Edoofa: This is also a viable option to consider.
Whichever you are comfortable with.
26/12/23, 2:38 PM - +263 71 399 6403: Okay that is  a better plan, so then I will have to send it to mom from school right
26/12/23, 2:39 PM - Dev Edoofa: Yes, Russell, if you are comfortable with it.
26/12/23, 2:39 PM - +263 71 399 6403: It is l have no problem with  it
26/12/23, 2:41 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that and I am looking forward to getting an update from your end. I would also like to reiterate that our operational hours are from 12:30 PM to 8:30 PM, Central African Time.
26/12/23, 2:41 PM - Dev Edoofa: Considering this, for our future sessions, you have to decide on an hour’s time that suits your availability within this timeframe and share the same with us so that we can tailor our subsequent sessions to accommodate your schedule effectively.
26/12/23, 2:41 PM - Dev Edoofa: For the next couple of days, we will have sessions on a daily basis and once we cover the first three steps of the admission cycle, we will have sessions scheduled on need basis. Hence, can you let me know at what time will you like us to schedule our sessions on a daily basis (from 12:30 Pm to 08:30 PM)?
26/12/23, 2:44 PM - +263 71 399 6403: From 1230 to 1330
26/12/23, 2:49 PM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know, in such a case, we will schedule tomorrow’s session at this time. It's important to note that all three forms with the Letter of recommendation should be completed and submitted by tomorrow before our session and as for the academic documents, you need to provide it by this Friday, i.e., 29th December.

This timeline is essential to ensure a smooth progression in the admission process and to meet the goal of concluding this session before Tuesday, enabling us to assist you in initiating your EWYL process on time. I hope we are together with this?
26/12/23, 2:51 PM - +263 71 399 6403: Yes sir l am following

I hope by then you will be able to fill out all the forms. If you have any queries or concerns before then, feel free to share them here in your admission group.
26/12/23, 3:00 PM - +263 71 399 6403: However I can only produce the O level results since l have not yet written  my Alevel examination
26/12/23, 3:02 PM - Dev Edoofa: yes, surely.
For A-level results, you can provide the letter of recommendation instead, which is readily provided by the school. <This message was edited>

27/12/23, 5:51 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am doing fine as well. Thank you for asking.
Shall we start with our session?
27/12/23, 5:52 PM - +263 78 308 6466: Yes
27/12/23, 5:54 PM - Dev Edoofa: Amazing, Moving forward in our today’s session, we will discuss a bit about Constance's university admission journey. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts, I will explain to you it in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them.

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
27/12/23, 5:56 PM - +263 78 308 6466: Yes  we may start
27/12/23, 5:56 PM - Dev Edoofa: <Media omitted>
27/12/23, 5:57 PM - +263 78 308 6466: Alright sir
27/12/23, 5:59 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
27/12/23, 5:59 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
27/12/23, 6:02 PM - +263 78 308 6466: They are  crystal clear
27/12/23, 6:07 PM - Dev Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
27/12/23, 6:07 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
27/12/23, 6:12 PM - +263 78 308 6466: This message was deleted
27/12/23, 6:12 PM - +263 78 308 6466: Yes l am following
27/12/23, 6:13 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
27/12/23, 6:13 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
27/12/23, 6:16 PM - +263 78 308 6466: They are crystal clear
27/12/23, 6:17 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through all 6 steps, please feel free to share your thoughts and queries if you have any.
27/12/23, 6:24 PM - +263 78 308 6466: Thank you sir

And also  what is required  for  a student to obtain a VISA
27/12/23, 6:32 PM - Dev Edoofa: Registration fees is need to be paid after you have received the letter of intent from the university that you had applied for
27/12/23, 6:33 PM - +263 78 308 6466: Noted  thank you

27/12/23, 6:35 PM - +263 78 308 6466: Yes l have  understood
27/12/23, 6:35 PM - Dev Edoofa: Great! Now, If we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
27/12/23, 6:39 PM - +263 78 308 6466: Yes
27/12/23, 6:39 PM - Dev Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life.

What understood  from the videos  is  the  vision that Edoofa  has to offer  affordable  and accessible  education  for all ,moreover  the need for scholarship  applicants  to be open  and follow  instruction , and how important  the Statement of Purpose is  for  a scholarship  applicant to prove they are  elligible for a scholarship    and to boost their scholarship percentage
28/12/23, 1:42 PM - Dev Edoofa: Brilliant, Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*.

28/12/23, 1:48 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by tomorrow 12:30 PM.
28/12/23, 1:49 PM - Dev Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded.

4/1/24, 12:25 PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Russell!
I hope you all are doing well.
4/1/24, 12:29 PM - Dev Edoofa: Russell, I have taken a note of this and completely undertsand. The most viable solution to take forward the process is that your parents can take part in the further process and the EWYL sessions so that your journey with Edoofa is not affected.
4/1/24, 12:30 PM - Dev Edoofa: Please let me know what do you feel about this?
4/1/24, 1:36 PM - +263 71 399 6403: Good afternoon its Russell 's parents

6/1/24, 8:50 AM - Dev Edoofa: Good Afternoon  Parents!
I hope all of you are doing great.

Since our operational hours were over at the time you replied, we were not able to take forward our conversation. Shall we start with our session now?
6/1/24, 10:45 AM - +263 71 399 6403: Morning we can start our session
6/1/24, 10:48 AM - +263 71 399 6403: null
6/1/24, 10:56 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that.
6/1/24, 10:56 AM - Dev Edoofa: we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey. we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*.
6/1/24, 10:57 AM - Dev Edoofa: Let us move forward with our discussion. To confirm our records: the course Russell has selected for his higher education is B.Sc (Cardiovascular Technology) and it's my understanding that Russell is planning to arrive in India during August 2025. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
6/1/24, 11:00 AM - +263 71 399 6403: That is good to hear that
6/1/24, 11:01 AM - +263 71 399 6403: Its correct
6/1/24, 11:09 AM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. Based on our experience of over 14 years and having assisted over 5000 students from different countries, we have realized that financial planning is the most important factor when a student plans for his/her higher education abroad.
6/1/24, 11:10 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am sure that you must be aware that 20-30% of students who are admitted into universities abroad are unable to fulfill their dream and come to India due to a lack of financial planning. The funds needed for booking flights, accommodation, and covering living expenses after arrival often become overwhelming, leading to the decision to defer their admission for a year. This, in turn, creates a gap in the child's education.
6/1/24, 11:10 AM - Dev Edoofa: To assist both students and parents in this regard, Edoofa Management has designed a Financial Secure Plan that aims to help you prepare for your higher educational finances without experiencing stress or last-minute rushes. I believe you must be wondering about the details of the same plan and how it helps the parents?
6/1/24, 11:19 AM - +263 71 399 6403: Thank you for having such idea
6/1/24, 11:27 AM - Dev Edoofa: You are most welcome, Mrs. Chivandire. Shall we move forward?
6/1/24, 11:28 AM - +263 71 399 6403: Yes
7/1/24, 8:34 AM - Dev Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Russell.
I hope you are doing well. There was a technical glitch due to which we were not able to take forward the conversation. I hope you understand. We will take forward our conversation at 1pm tomorrow. Have a wonderful day ahead!
7/1/24, 9:46 AM - +263 71 399 6403: Morning thank you
9/1/24, 10:01 AM - Dev Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Russell!
I hope all of you are doing great. While I was wrapping up my day yesterday, I observed that we were not able to have a smooth discussion for the past couple of days, which has led to some delay in the admission process. We are aware of your immense trust in us and we surely care about your future. Considering that in mind, I wanted to schedule a specific session today at 2:30 pm so that we can cover the process we are lagging behind,  and ensure that your admission process is on track.
9/1/24, 10:30 AM - +263 71 399 6403: Morning Mr Kumar noted thank you

20/1/24, 8:38 AM - Dev Edoofa: This message was deleted
20/1/24, 8:55 AM - Dev Edoofa: Additionally, since it has been a while since we last connected, I was wondering how you and your family are doing?
20/1/24, 11:26 AM - +263 71 399 6403: I wasn't aware that you were not feeling well anyway thats good news if you are better these days
20/1/24, 11:28 AM - +263 71 399 6403: My family is doing well thank you for caring
20/1/24, 11:42 AM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for your wishes about my recovery and I am glad that you are doing good!
20/1/24, 11:43 AM - Dev Edoofa: Before reaching out to you today, I was going through pictures and videos from Edoofa's very first SLICE CON held last week, and that sparked my curiosity about whether you are familiar with what SLICE CON is or not?
20/1/24, 12:09 PM - +263 71 399 6403: I am not familiar with that
20/1/24, 12:10 PM - Dev Edoofa: Let me tell you a bit about the same.  Recently, Edoofa hosted a conference called the Symposium of Leaders, Innovators, and Creators at Edoofa, also known as 'SLICE-CON.'
20/1/24, 12:10 PM - Dev Edoofa: The conference was attended by all the Edoofians of 2023 and a few senior Edoofians from previous batches. It focused on the art of creation, innovation, and, most importantly, the mindset required to make an impact in one's career.
20/1/24, 12:10 PM - Dev Edoofa: During this Industrial Visit and the conference - SLICE CON, Corporate leaders, such as the CEOs and Co-founders from renowned companies like Rage Coffee, Sirona Hygiene, Jolin New York, and more, shared their insights and experiences. These individuals are at the helm of multi-millionaire brands, leading large marketing teams. Their presence added immense value, providing students with the opportunity to engage in transformative conversations.
20/1/24, 12:10 PM - Dev Edoofa: Let me share a glimpse of the conference with you and your family, I am certain that Russell too would be this excited to attend such events when he comes to India.

22/1/24, 7:44 AM - +263 71 399 6403: Good morning
22/1/24, 9:48 AM - Dev Edoofa: Good Morning Mrs. Chavendire!
I hope you are doing great. We will take forward our conversation at 4:00 PM today. I hope you have a great day ahead!
22/1/24, 11:07 AM - +263 71 399 6403: Noted thank you
22/1/24, 4:03 PM - +263 71 399 6403: Good afternoon
22/1/24, 4:07 PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Afternoon @263713996403! 
I hope you are doing well. We have our session today. May I know if you are ready to take forward our conversation?
22/1/24, 4:08 PM - +263 71 399 6403: Afternoon l am ready now
22/1/24, 4:10 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that!
22/1/24, 4:10 PM - Dev Edoofa: Based on our experience of over 14 years and having assisted over 5000 students from different countries, we have realized that financial planning is the most important factor when a student plans for his/her higher education abroad.
22/1/24, 4:10 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am sure that you must be aware that 20-30% of students who are admitted into universities abroad are unable to fulfill their dream and come to India due to a lack of financial planning. The funds needed for booking flights, accommodation, and covering living expenses after arrival often become overwhelming, leading to the decision to defer their admission for a year. This, in turn, creates a gap in the child's education.
22/1/24, 4:10 PM - Dev Edoofa: To assist both students and parents in this regard, Edoofa Management has designed a Financial Secure Plan that aims to help you prepare for your higher educational finances without experiencing stress or last-minute rushes. I believe you must be wondering about the details of the same plan and how it helps the parents?
22/1/24, 4:18 PM - +263 71 399 6403: Its reality
22/1/24, 4:18 PM - Dev Edoofa: Yes @263713996403, it is! Let me share with you the plan:
22/1/24, 4:18 PM - Dev Edoofa: Edoofa Secure Plan is important for parents who have children joining the university for tertiary education in the next one to two years for several reasons:

*Financial Preparedness:* The Edoofa Secure plan helps parents prepare financially for the costs after the Scholarship being offered so that they are not caught off guard.

*Reduced Financial Stress:* Having the Edoofa Secure Plan in place can significantly reduce the financial stress on you as parents when your child is about to enter university. Knowing that there is a dedicated fund for education expenses provides peace of mind.
22/1/24, 4:19 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Avoiding Debt*: Without proper savings, some parents may resort to taking out loans or accumulating credit card debt to cover their child's education costs. This Educational savings plan helps avoid the burden of debt and high-interest payments.

*Compound Interest:* By starting to save early and consistently contributing to the savings plan, parents can take advantage of compound interest, which can significantly increase the amount available for education expenses.
22/1/24, 4:19 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Flexibility and Control:* The Edoofa Secure savings plans allow parents to have greater control over their finances and how they allocate funds for their child's education. They can choose investment options that align with their risk tolerance and financial goals.

*Encouraging Responsibility*: Involving your child in the process of saving for their education teaches them financial responsibility and the value of higher education. It also motivates them to outperform in Academics.
22/1/24, 4:19 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Adapting to Unexpected Changes*: Life is full of surprises, and circumstances can change especially when there are political reforms changing each day impacting the Local Currency. Having an Edoofa Secure Plan allows parents to adapt to unexpected changes in their financial situation while still prioritizing their child's education.

*Peace of Mind:* Overall, having the Edoofa Secure plan provides parents with peace of mind, knowing that they are actively planning for their child's future and increasing the likelihood of providing them with a solid education.
22/1/24, 4:19 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, when you go through all the above benefits, I am sure you can see that the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan is an important financial tool for parents/students who are supposed to enter the university soon. 

It helps ensure that the financial aspect of tertiary education is well-managed, reduces stress, and allows parents to provide the best opportunities for their children without resorting to debt or financial hardship. Isn't this something you and your family also wish to have?
22/1/24, 4:27 PM - +263 71 399 6403: I wish that
22/1/24, 4:27 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through the above points, do you want me to help you understand how the Edoofa Secure Plan works?
22/1/24, 4:31 PM - +263 71 399 6403: Yes l need your assistance
22/1/24, 4:31 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, as you are aware, we are currently in January 2024, and we have a good 20-21 months to plan for your finances before you start your university education in 2025.
22/1/24, 4:31 PM - Dev Edoofa: During the counseling session, you were informed that at Edoofa, we guarantee a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship on the tuition fees. Hence, the cost of education, including food and accommodation after the scholarship, would be between $2000-$3000, and it could be even less. Not more than that.
22/1/24, 4:31 PM - Dev Edoofa: This means that if you can save $150 per month for the next 20 months, you will be able to save $3000. This amount is more than enough for the first year of university fees, including tuition fees (if any), food, and accommodation. I hope you agree with this?
22/1/24, 4:36 PM - +263 71 399 6403: Okay thank you
22/1/24, 4:39 PM - Dev Edoofa: Right, this means that by the time you would be in India, you would have already saved the $3000 that will cover the first-year fee.
22/1/24, 4:39 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, in these next 20 months, I am sure you would also be engaged in the EWYL program, and if you secure a minimum of $1000 in 20 months, that means the fees for 1.5 years are already secured.
22/1/24, 4:39 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, for a 3-year course, if we follow the same approach for the remaining 1.5 years, the educational journey for the student and the financial journey for the parent will be easy and smooth. I believe you must be able to see this perspective?
22/1/24, 4:47 PM - +263 71 399 6403: Noted thats good news
22/1/24, 5:08 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. With that said, there is also another benefit, I am sure being in Zimbabwe you know how drastically the exchange rate fluctuates.
22/1/24, 5:08 PM - Dev Edoofa: If you are buying a dollar today, you might be spending 7000 bonds, but if you buy a dollar after a month, the rate would be different.
22/1/24, 5:08 PM - Dev Edoofa: Also, even if you choose to buy dollars every month and save at your home, it is not safe since there is news of robbery, and mugging every day.
22/1/24, 5:08 PM - Dev Edoofa: In that case, you will opt to save in the Bank, but again we know that savings in the Bank require a Nostro Account which means you have to pay the bank to keep your money safe, right?
22/1/24, 5:21 PM - +263 71 399 6403: Thats true
22/1/24, 5:21 PM - Dev Edoofa: That is great to hear, considering these constraints, Edoofa Management has decided to help the parents and students prepare for the journey way ahead of time by helping them save money with Edoofa without any additional charges but rather saving additional money as well. Do you want me to explain how this has been achieved?
22/1/24, 5:55 PM - Dev Edoofa: Are you still available @263713996403?
22/1/24, 5:55 PM - +263 71 399 6403: Yes
22/1/24, 5:57 PM - Dev Edoofa: That is good to know! Do you want me to explain further on this?
22/1/24, 5:59 PM - +263 71 399 6403: Yes
22/1/24, 6:00 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Program Fee (Enrollment Fee) that you were asked to pay is $350.
22/1/24, 6:00 PM - Dev Edoofa: Under the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan, a parent has to deposit a small amount of money which is $150 every month for the next 10 months. 

That means, in 10 months, the money saved will be $1500.
22/1/24, 6:00 PM - Dev Edoofa: Imagine you paying $15 every month to the Bank of Zimbabwe to keep your money safe, and here Edoofa is paying you $15 every month to keep your money safe. Now, you must be wondering, why only for 10 months and not for 20 months, right?
22/1/24, 6:00 PM - +263 71 399 6403: Yes
22/1/24, 6:01 PM - Dev Edoofa: If you see the bigger picture, you will realize that the reason is quite simple. Upon the completion of the 10 installments, the Edoofa Admissions team will initiate the Child’s Admission Process by applying early to the universities to secure their scholarship and their university seat.
22/1/24, 6:01 PM - Dev Edoofa: Reserving seats earlier increases the chances of obtaining a maximum scholarship. A higher scholarship means lower fees, and by securing the seat, you will be entitled to pay the fees as per the old fee structure of the university, not the new one implemented in January 2025. Furthermore, when applying to the universities, you will receive an offer letter or a letter of intent detailing the fees, scholarship, and registration fees.
22/1/24, 6:01 PM - Dev Edoofa: As explained during the enrollment process, the registration fee is a portion of your first-year university fee, paid to reserve the seat. It ranges from $500-$1000 and is not an additional fee. 

From the $1500 you saved with Edoofa, the registration fee will be paid to the university, securing the seat. For instance, if the registration fee is $1000, Edoofa will pay $1000 from the $1500 saved in 10 months. The updated balance with Edoofa will be $500, which will be paid to the university upon your arrival in India.
22/1/24, 6:01 PM - Dev Edoofa: This eases the financial burden on the parent, as there is no immediate payment required upon the student's arrival. The $500 saved will cover the remaining fees for the semester/year, as specified in the offer letter from the university. What are your thoughts on this?
22/1/24, 6:05 PM - +263 71 399 6403: Well explained
22/1/24, 6:14 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to see that we are together so far. With this plan for the next 10 months, I am sure you must be wondering what will happen in the next 10 months, considering you have already secured your scholarship seat with the university due to your hard work in the first 10 months. Is my understanding correct?
22/1/24, 6:21 PM - +263 71 399 6403: Following
22/1/24, 6:36 PM - Dev Edoofa: Let me help you with that as well. In the 11th month, you will be guided to open an FBC Mastercard bank account in Zimbabwe with a deposit of $150. The reason for this is that when you apply for your student Visa, the Embassy asks for a Bank Statement, and this account will serve that purpose.
22/1/24, 6:36 PM - Dev Edoofa: We understand it might be expensive if you deposit another $1500 for the remaining 10 months in FB  Bank Zimbabwe, so to avoid the same challenges, we have designed the plan accordingly. You will only be depositing for the 11th, 12th, 13th, and 14th month, which is 4 months.
22/1/24, 6:36 PM - Dev Edoofa: Once the 4 months are completed, our Department of Student Welfare (DSW) team will assist you with your visa process. The bank statement will act as one of the required documents, and once you receive the visa, you can withdraw the amount from FBC and book the flight ticket. This will help you utilize the money as well.
22/1/24, 6:37 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, from the 16th Month till the 20th month, considering it is a 6-month window, you can again continue depositing the money ($150) with Edoofa which can be used in the fee as and when required or you can decide to save this $900 of these 6 months with you as well. This is something which you are free to choose. I hope you have understood the financial secure plan now?
22/1/24, 7:29 PM - +263 71 399 6403: Good idea
22/1/24, 7:31 PM - +263 71 399 6403: Okay
22/1/24, 7:34 PM - +263 71 399 6403: Well understood
22/1/24, 9:19 PM - Dev Edoofa: That's great. Now that you have all the information, I want you to take some time and discuss the financial security plan with your family members. Help them understand its importance and details. Once you're done, we can reconnect, have a discussion, and address any queries you may have. After resolving your concerns, I'll guide you through starting your financial security plan.
22/1/24, 9:20 PM - Dev Edoofa: We will conclude today's conversation, and I will connect with you on tomorrow at 4:00PM to resume our discussion. In the meantime, I hope you'll have a detailed discussion with your family and jot down any questions or thoughts you have regarding the Financial Secure plan.

Wishing you a good night, and please extend our regards to your family.
22/1/24, 9:24 PM - +263 71 399 6403: Same to you and thank you
23/1/24, 4:11 PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Afternoon Mrs. Chavendire and Russell!

23/1/24, 4:57 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to know that, may I know if you have any queries regarding the Edoofa financial Secure Plan?
23/1/24, 4:58 PM - +263 71 399 6403: No queries so far
23/1/24, 5:03 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that! Now moving forward, to ensure the efficient implementation of this plan, we need to decide upon the month from which this plan is going to start and a fixed date on which you will positively deposit $150 every month. 


Our complete focus is on providing students and parents with the best ways to avail of these opportunities, We completely understand that every parent can't make the payment on our specified date. So considering this situation, we let them decide the plan initiation month and date according to their comfort. So, may I know from what month you wish to start this plan, as well as the fixed date of every month on which you will be able to deposit $150 every month?
23/1/24, 5:19 PM - +263 71 399 6403: As of now l don't have specific month for payment commencement because l am a hustler l can even do once of payment in the last month
23/1/24, 5:23 PM - Dev Edoofa: I understand @263713996403. But may I know how are your preparations going on for Russell's future education? God forbid, if you are unable to arrange the finances for a month, Russell's admission may be affected. So please help me understand your preparations?
23/1/24, 5:24 PM - +263 71 399 6403: Even in March 2024
23/1/24, 5:32 PM - Dev Edoofa: May I please ask you to explain the above message? I was not able to understand it.
23/1/24, 5:37 PM - +263 71 399 6403: <Media omitted>

26/1/24, 2:51 PM - Dev Edoofa: Also, as this plan commences from the month of January, for the efficient implementation of this plan, we need to decide on a fixed date on which you will deposit $150 every month. This will provide you with the flexibility to align your finances accordingly.
26/1/24, 2:51 PM - Dev Edoofa: Our complete focus is on providing students and parents with the best ways to avail themselves of these opportunities. We understand that every parent may not be able to make the payment on our specified date. Therefore, considering this situation, we allow them to decide the payment date according to their comfort. In light of the same, may I know the fixed date every month on which you will deposit $150?
