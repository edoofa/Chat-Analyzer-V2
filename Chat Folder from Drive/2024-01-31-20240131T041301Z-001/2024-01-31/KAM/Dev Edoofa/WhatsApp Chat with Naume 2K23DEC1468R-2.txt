If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion? <This message was edited>
18/1/24, 1:11 PM - +263 77 616 8836: Yes I am

18/1/24, 1:15 PM - Dev Edoofa: <Media omitted>
18/1/24, 1:29 PM - +263 77 616 8836: You can go ahead now
18/1/24, 1:39 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
18/1/24, 1:39 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.
18/1/24, 1:39 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
18/1/24, 1:39 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.
18/1/24, 1:40 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process, the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
18/1/24, 1:40 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.
18/1/24, 1:40 PM - Dev Edoofa: I hope these steps are clear?
18/1/24, 1:54 PM - +263 77 616 8836: Okey thank you so much
18/1/24, 2:04 PM - Dev Edoofa: You are most welcome!  If we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*? <This message was edited>
18/1/24, 2:23 PM - +263 77 616 8836: Sorry I have got network challenge but as for now we may start
18/1/24, 2:25 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that!
18/1/24, 2:27 PM - Dev Edoofa: This message was deleted
18/1/24, 2:27 PM - Dev Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
18/1/24, 2:27 PM - Dev Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding until you are ready, shall we start with our discussion with me individually? 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention.
18/1/24, 2:27 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students*

This is a video by the founders of EDOOFA, in which they share 2 important qualities of successful Edoofians- who've secured a maximum scholarship and earned scholarship credits.

18/1/24, 2:27 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

The third video is about Schools, Colleges, and Universities. I'm sure you're excited to learn more about the schools, colleges, and universities on the Edoofa Platform. Founders talk about their decade-long journey of discovering these schools and the experiences that students are having in these schools.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DW82emflFHw&feature=youtu.be
18/1/24, 2:28 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP*

The fourth video is about the Statement of Purpose (SOP). The most important step towards securing a good scholarship is to write the Statement of Purpose but to know why it is important, watching this video will clear your doubts and questions.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftsGGGBYMrs&feature=youtu.be
18/1/24, 2:29 PM - Dev Edoofa: @263776168836 , I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes if you have a smooth internet connection.

22/1/24, 9:58 PM - Dev Edoofa: You are most welcome!
23/1/24, 2:10 PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Afternoon Mr. and Mrs. Sabiti and Naume!
I hope you are doing well. May I know what is the update on the tasks that were assigned to you yesterday?
23/1/24, 2:35 PM - +263 77 616 8836: Fine thanks and how are you
23/1/24, 2:36 PM - +263 77 616 8836: Shall we send now
23/1/24, 2:39 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am doing well. Thanks for asking. You can surely send them now.
23/1/24, 2:40 PM - +263 77 616 8836: <Media omitted>
23/1/24, 2:42 PM - +263 77 616 8836: 2. Explain the difference between rights and duties and give a further explanation of the difference in human rights and civil rights.

Rights are what one want others to do for him/her, whereas duties are those acts that one should perform for others. Thus a right comes with an obligation to show respect for the rights of others. The obligations that  accompany rights are in form of duties.

Rights and duties are interrelated in every social and political activity of man. While rights exalt individual liberty, duties express the dignity of that liberty. Duties of a juridical nature presuppose others of amoral nature which support them in principle and constitute their basis.

The main difference between human rights and civil rights include that human rights are rights one acquires by being alive whilst civil rights are rights that one obtains by being a legal member of a certain political state .

Civil rights are legal rights that protect individuals from discrimination based on race, sex and other characteristics. Human rights are rights you are born with-you have them simply by being human, whether or not they have been put into the form of a law in the country where you reside.

Civil rights are granted by government and human rights are rights that everyone has simply because they are human.
Thus, these are the difference between human rights and civil rights
23/1/24, 2:42 PM - +263 77 616 8836: 3. What is the difference between a prosecutor and an attorney?

One of the critical distinguishing factors is that a prosecutor typically works for the government agency bringing criminal charges and must prove the defendant's guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, while the defense attorney represents the person accused of a crime and attempts to maintain the clients innocence.

A prosecutor and a defense attorney are both lawyers who have completed law school and passed the bar examination. However, a defense attorney defends the individual that a prosecutor is trying to convince the jury is guilty.

Typically the prosecutor will ask easy soft ball questions like what did you see? or what did you do? This style of questioning is called direct examination and it is completely different from cross examinations. A prosecutor's job is easier than a defense attorney generally .
23/1/24, 2:42 PM - +263 77 616 8836: 4. Why am l interested in criminal law?
Criminal justice is a fantastic field to enter if you want to do something different from sitting at a desk all day and if you want to avoid being bored.  Those considering a career in the criminal justice sector may also benefit significantly from their formative experiences while working there. 

The reason makes criminal law interesting is that the wrong committed is considered against society, not just the individual. This makes studying and practicing criminal law much more exciting and challenging at the same time.

I'm passionate about my community and determined to do my part to keep residents safe. Criminal justice gives a chance to accomplish just that while also pursuing a unique career path that is simultaneously exciting, interesting and highly gratifying.

If someone is facing criminal charges that may result in paying a fine, probation or possible jail time, they need a defence lawyer to represent them. 

One likely needs a defense lawyer if they have been charged with a felony, but may need one for a miscellaneous charges such as a traffic ticket
23/1/24, 2:42 PM - +263 77 616 8836: 5. I am a strategic thinker and l have problem solving abilities. The best lawyers are creative especially when managing a firm and representing clients at the same time. My ability to think creatively can make the difference between finding a unique solution or ultimately losing in court.

I have knowledge of law practices , communication, protocols and regulations, interpersonal skills and the ability to think outside the box and solve problems.

Soft skills play a significant role in the legal profession complementing of technical knowledge and experience that lawyers possess. These personal attributes and abilities are essential for effective communication, collaboration and interaction with others in the legal field.

I have the ability to conduct legal research and writing, analysing the law , explaining legal  information to clients, providing legal advice , being knowledgeable and remaining current in legal events.
23/1/24, 2:56 PM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the responses to the documents. May I please get to know if you are done with the Statement of Purpose as well?
23/1/24, 2:57 PM - +263 77 616 8836: Am not sure if I left out something, may you please assist us
23/1/24, 2:58 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am talking about this form. Have you filled this one?
23/1/24, 3:15 PM - +263 77 616 8836: It's not opening maybe due to poor network connection
23/1/24, 3:17 PM - +263 77 616 8836: I will keep on opening it , I will let you know when am done
23/1/24, 3:26 PM - Dev Edoofa: Okay, @263776168836! Thanks for letting me know. In that case, we will be concluding the conversation for now and we will reconnect tomorrow at 4:00 pm for our next session. 

I hope by then you will be able to fill out all the forms. If you have any queries or concerns before then, feel free to share them here in your admission group. Wish you a blessed day and please ensure to extend our regards to your family as well.
23/1/24, 3:31 PM - +263 77 616 8836: Let's make it 11:30 up to 12 because we might be busy at 4pm
23/1/24, 3:35 PM - Dev Edoofa: I understand @263776168836! We will have our session tomorrow at 11:30 am to take forward our conversation. Make sure you are filling out the SOP form before that. Till then I hope you have a great day ahead!
23/1/24, 4:14 PM - +263 77 616 8836: Okey thank you
24/1/24, 11:36 AM - +263 77 616 8836: Greetings, she managed to complete you gave her
24/1/24, 11:37 AM - +263 77 616 8836: We may continue with our today's session
24/1/24, 11:37 AM - +263 77 616 8836: She completed the task you gave her
24/1/24, 11:39 AM - Dev Edoofa: Good Afternoon @263776168836!
I hope you are doing well. I have taken note of her completing the tasks that were shared with her. Thank you for completing the tasks on time.
24/1/24, 11:40 AM - Dev Edoofa: With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey. we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*.
24/1/24, 11:41 AM - +263 77 616 8836: We are doing very well thanks
24/1/24, 11:41 AM - Dev Edoofa: You are most welcome. I am glad to hear that!
24/1/24, 11:43 AM - Dev Edoofa: In the meantime. Let us move forward with our discussion. To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is BBA and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2025. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
24/1/24, 11:45 AM - +263 77 616 8836: Yes she is planning to come to India in 2025
24/1/24, 11:46 AM - +263 77 616 8836: Yes during August intake.
24/1/24, 11:47 AM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. Based on our experience of over 14 years and having assisted over 5000 students from different countries, we have realized that financial planning is the most important factor when a student plans for his/her higher education abroad.
24/1/24, 11:47 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am sure that you must be aware that 20-30% of students who are admitted into universities abroad are unable to fulfill their dream and come to India due to a lack of financial planning. The funds needed for booking flights, accommodation, and covering living expenses after arrival often become overwhelming, leading to the decision to defer their admission for a year. This, in turn, creates a gap in the child's education.
24/1/24, 11:47 AM - Dev Edoofa: To assist both students and parents in this regard, Edoofa Management has designed a Financial Secure Plan that aims to help you prepare for your higher educational finances without experiencing stress or last-minute rushes. I believe you must be wondering about the details of the same plan and how it helps the parents?
24/1/24, 11:49 AM - +263 77 616 8836: You are 100% correct
24/1/24, 11:52 AM - +263 77 616 8836: Yes the is much need time for preparation that's is the reason for the why she is coming  in 2025.So that we will spend the whole year processing everything without rushing
24/1/24, 12:04 PM - Dev Edoofa: Yes, keeping that in mind, we designed a new beneficial plan for the parents. Edoofa Secure Plan is important for parents who have children joining the university for tertiary education in the next one to two years for several reasons:
24/1/24, 12:04 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Financial Preparedness:* The Edoofa Secure plan helps parents prepare financially for the costs after the Scholarship being offered so that they are not caught off guard.

*Reduced Financial Stress:* Having the Edoofa Secure Plan in place can significantly reduce the financial stress on you as parents when your child is about to enter university. Knowing that there is a dedicated fund for education expenses provides peace of mind.
24/1/24, 12:04 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Avoiding Debt*: Without proper savings, some parents may resort to taking out loans or accumulating credit card debt to cover their child's education costs. This Educational savings plan helps avoid the burden of debt and high-interest payments.

*Compound Interest:* By starting to save early and consistently contributing to the savings plan, parents can take advantage of compound interest, which can significantly increase the amount available for education expenses.
24/1/24, 12:04 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Flexibility and Control:* The Edoofa Secure savings plans allow parents to have greater control over their finances and how they allocate funds for their child's education. They can choose investment options that align with their risk tolerance and financial goals.

*Encouraging Responsibility*: Involving your child in the process of saving for their education teaches them financial responsibility and the value of higher education. It also motivates them to outperform in Academics.
24/1/24, 12:04 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Adapting to Unexpected Changes*: Life is full of surprises, and circumstances can change especially when there are political reforms changing each day impacting the Local Currency. Having an Edoofa Secure Plan allows parents to adapt to unexpected changes in their financial situation while still prioritizing their child's education.

*Peace of Mind:* Overall, having the Edoofa Secure plan provides parents with peace of mind, knowing that they are actively planning for their child's future and increasing the likelihood of providing them with a solid education.
24/1/24, 12:04 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, when you go through all the above benefits, I am sure you can see that the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan is an important financial tool for parents/students who are supposed to enter the university soon. 

It helps ensure that the financial aspect of tertiary education is well-managed, reduces stress, and allows parents to provide the best opportunities for their children without resorting to debt or financial hardship. Isn't this something you and your family also wish to have?
24/1/24, 12:15 PM - +263 77 616 8836: That's sounds great.we wish that too.
24/1/24, 12:16 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through the above points, do you want me to help you understand how the Edoofa Secure Plan works?
24/1/24, 12:18 PM - +263 77 616 8836: Yes you may go ahead
24/1/24, 12:19 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, as you are aware, we are currently in January 2024, and we have a good 20 months to plan for your finances before you start your university education in 2025.
24/1/24, 12:19 PM - Dev Edoofa: This message was deleted
24/1/24, 12:20 PM - Dev Edoofa: During the counseling session, you were informed that at Edoofa, we guarantee a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship on the tuition fees. Hence, the cost of education, including food and accommodation after the scholarship, would be between $2000-$3000, and it could be even less. Not more than that.
24/1/24, 12:20 PM - Dev Edoofa: This means that if you can save $150 per month for the next 20 months, you will be able to save $3000. This amount is more than enough for the first year of university fees, including tuition fees (if any), food, and accommodation. I hope you agree with this?
24/1/24, 12:22 PM - +263 77 616 8836: That's  great but I think we will start to pay in April.
24/1/24, 12:26 PM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. I have taken note of it. But I would recommend you first understand the whole plan and then decide what is going to be good for you. I hope you understand my concern?
24/1/24, 12:28 PM - +263 77 616 8836: Yes i am getting you Sir.Thank you for that
24/1/24, 12:33 PM - Dev Edoofa: You are most welcome! Now moving forward, After saving for 20 months, it means that by the time you are in India, you will have already saved the $3000 that will cover the first-year fee.
24/1/24, 12:33 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, in these next 20 months, I am sure you would also be engaged in the EWYL program, and if you secure a minimum of $1000 in 20 months, that means the fees for 1.5 years are already secured.
24/1/24, 12:33 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, for a 3-year course, if we follow the same approach for the remaining 1.5 years, the educational journey for the student and the financial journey for the parent will be easy and smooth. I believe you must be able to see this perspective?
24/1/24, 12:41 PM - +263 77 616 8836: Okey that's wonderful
24/1/24, 12:52 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. With that said, there is also another benefit, I am sure being in Zimbabwe you know how drastically the exchange rate fluctuates.
24/1/24, 12:52 PM - Dev Edoofa: If you are buying a dollar today, you might be spending 7000 bonds, but if you buy a dollar after a month, the rate would be different.
24/1/24, 12:52 PM - Dev Edoofa: Also, even if you choose to buy dollars every month and save at your home, it is not safe since there is news of robbery, and mugging every day.
24/1/24, 12:52 PM - Dev Edoofa: In that case, you will opt to save in the Bank, but again we know that savings in the Bank require a Nostro Account which means you have to pay the bank to keep your money safe, right?
24/1/24, 1:11 PM - +263 77 616 8836: True that
24/1/24, 1:13 PM - +263 77 616 8836: Yes you have to bank so  that you will save your money
24/1/24, 1:13 PM - Dev Edoofa: Exactly,  considering these constraints, Edoofa Management has decided to help the parents and students prepare for the journey way ahead of time by helping them save money with Edoofa without any additional charges but rather saving additional money as well. Do you want me to explain how this has been achieved?
24/1/24, 1:14 PM - +263 77 616 8836: Am sure it will be safe to send you there so that we won't face financial challenges
24/1/24, 1:14 PM - +263 77 616 8836: Yes tell us
24/1/24, 1:15 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Program Fee (Enrollment Fee) that you were asked to pay is $350.
24/1/24, 1:15 PM - Dev Edoofa: Under the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan, a parent has to deposit a small amount of money which is $150 every month for the next 10 months. 

That means, in 10 months, the money saved will be $1500.
24/1/24, 1:15 PM - Dev Edoofa: Imagine you paying $15 every month to the Bank of Zimbabwe to keep your money safe, and here Edoofa is paying you $15 every month to keep your money safe. Now, you must be wondering, why only for 10 months and not for 20 months, right?
24/1/24, 1:16 PM - +263 77 616 8836: Sure so it's safe to send you there and we will definitely do that
24/1/24, 1:22 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you have immense faith in us. Do you want to know, why you need to deposit $150 for 10 days and why not 20 days?
24/1/24, 1:26 PM - +263 77 616 8836: We will definitely do that after 2 month because as for now we are paying fees for the other young sister
24/1/24, 1:27 PM - +263 77 616 8836: Am sure  after that all things will move smoothly
24/1/24, 1:33 PM - Dev Edoofa: I completely understand, @263776168836! But as we discussed before, I would recommend you to first understand the plan completely, we can decide other specifications later on. I hope you understand?
24/1/24, 1:48 PM - +263 77 616 8836: Okey
24/1/24, 1:48 PM - +263 77 616 8836: Yes I understand
24/1/24, 1:53 PM - Dev Edoofa: Great! Now let me answer this question that may arise in your mind. If you see the bigger picture, you will realize that the reason is quite simple. Upon the completion of the 10 installments, the Edoofa Admissions team will initiate the Child’s Admission Process by applying early to the universities to secure their scholarship and their university seat.
24/1/24, 1:53 PM - Dev Edoofa: Reserving seats earlier increases the chances of obtaining a maximum scholarship. A higher scholarship means lower fees, and by securing the seat, you will be entitled to pay the fees as per the old fee structure of the university, not the new one implemented in January 2025. Furthermore, when applying to the universities, you will receive an offer letter or a letter of intent detailing the fees, scholarship, and registration fees.
24/1/24, 1:53 PM - Dev Edoofa: As explained during the enrollment process, the registration fee is a portion of your first-year university fee, paid to reserve the seat. It ranges from $500-$1000 and is not an additional fee. 

From the $1500 you saved with Edoofa, the registration fee will be paid to the university, securing the seat. For instance, if the registration fee is $1000, Edoofa will pay $1000 from the $1500 saved in 10 months. The updated balance with Edoofa will be $500, which will be paid to the university upon your arrival in India.
24/1/24, 1:53 PM - Dev Edoofa: This eases the financial burden on the parent, as there is no immediate payment required upon the student's arrival. The $500 saved will cover the remaining fees for the semester/year, as specified in the offer letter from the university. What are your thoughts on this?
24/1/24, 2:45 PM - Dev Edoofa: Are you still available, @263776168836?
24/1/24, 4:09 PM - +263 77 616 8836: Network connection
26/1/24, 9:22 AM - Dev Edoofa: Good Afternoon Mr. and Mrs. Sabiti and Naume!
I hope you are doing well and are having a wonderful start to the day. I felt a bit under the weather yesterday, so I took a day off to focus on my health. Today, I am feeling better and completely ready to take our conversation forward. I completely understand the network challenges you were facing. We will have our conversation at 3:00 PM to take forward our conversation, Plaese let me know if you are going  to be available at that time?
26/1/24, 3:06 PM - +263 77 616 8836: Okey we may continue
26/1/24, 3:07 PM - +263 77 616 8836: We doing well thanks and you
26/1/24, 3:07 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that! I am doing fine as well. May I know if you were able to understand the last messages that were shared in our last conversation?
26/1/24, 3:18 PM - +263 77 616 8836: We were discussing about financial plan
26/1/24, 3:22 PM - Dev Edoofa: Yes, @263776168836! So shall we move forward?
26/1/24, 3:28 PM - +263 77 616 8836: Yes
26/1/24, 3:36 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to see that we are together so far. With this plan for the next 10 months, I am sure you must be wondering what will happen in the next 10 months, considering you have already secured your scholarship seat with the university due to your hard work in the first 10 months. Is my understanding correct?
26/1/24, 3:38 PM - +263 77 616 8836: Yes we will definitely go to the next step
26/1/24, 3:44 PM - Dev Edoofa: Let me help you with that as well. In the 11th month, you will be guided to open an FBC Mastercard bank account in Zimbabwe with a deposit of $150. The reason for this is that when you apply for your student Visa, the Embassy asks for a Bank Statement, and this account will serve that purpose.
26/1/24, 3:44 PM - Dev Edoofa: We understand it might be expensive if you deposit another $1500 for the remaining 10 months in FB  Bank Zimbabwe, so to avoid the same challenges, we have designed the plan accordingly. You will only be depositing for the 11th, 12th, 13th, and 14th month, which is 4 months.
26/1/24, 3:45 PM - Dev Edoofa: Once the 4 months are completed, our Department of Student Welfare (DSW) team will assist you with your visa process. The bank statement will act as one of the required documents, and once you receive the visa, you can withdraw the amount from FBC and book the flight ticket. This will help you utilize the money as well. How does it sound?
26/1/24, 3:59 PM - +263 77 616 8836: Okey Okey
26/1/24, 4:00 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, from the 16th Month till the 20th month, considering it is a 6-month window, you can again continue depositing the money ($150) with Edoofa which can be used in the fee as and when required or you can decide to save this $900 of these 6 months with you as well. This is something which you are free to choose. I hope you have understood the financial secure plan now?
26/1/24, 4:01 PM - +263 77 616 8836: Yes I understand that.
26/1/24, 4:01 PM - Dev Edoofa: That's great. Now that you have all the information, I want you to take some time and discuss the financial security plan with your family members. Help them understand its importance and details. Once you're done, we can reconnect, have a discussion, and address any queries you may have. After resolving your concerns, I'll guide you through starting your financial security plan.
26/1/24, 4:02 PM - Dev Edoofa: Could you let me know when you think you'll have the discussion with your family? This way, we can schedule our next session accordingly.
26/1/24, 4:07 PM - +263 77 616 8836: We have already discuss with them.They just wanted to know the banking details so that they will start paying on April.I am happy now because you already talk about it .So we will use FBC.
26/1/24, 4:07 PM - +263 77 616 8836: How about account number
26/1/24, 4:09 PM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know about your comfortable dates, but @263776168836 at the time the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan is not going to be valid as this plan ensures that the parents or guardians can start preparing at the start of this plan and eventually save the amount accordingly. But if you start around the end of April, you may not have sufficient savings for the finances of Naume's higher education. This will eventually become a roadblock in Naume's admission journey. I hope you understand my concern?
26/1/24, 4:15 PM - +263 77 616 8836: We will manage even before the end of April.Even if we earn money before April we will pay after crop harvest
26/1/24, 4:24 PM - Dev Edoofa: I completely understand your situation but if you see that if you start saving from February to November, you will be able to save $1500, but if you start saving from April to November, you will be able to save $1200, which will in the end become a problem in the end. I hope you understand?
26/1/24, 4:25 PM - +263 77 616 8836: We will pay double amount of $150
26/1/24, 4:27 PM - +263 77 616 8836: We are sure that we will manage because as for now we have a little bit pressure.
26/1/24, 4:34 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you will be able to manage @263776168836 . So may I please ask you to send me a breakup of the finances, starting from April to November, how much money you will deposit every month so that you can save $1500 at the end of November? It will help us to get clarity on your plan of preparation and prepare for further timelines as well.
26/1/24, 4:35 PM - +263 77 616 8836: Not sure that we will  make a plan
26/1/24, 4:40 PM - Dev Edoofa: Okay, I understand. But can you please let us know in which two months will you be able to pay $300 to cover the deficit if you start in April?
26/1/24, 4:43 PM - +263 77 616 8836: Okey will let you know
26/1/24, 4:48 PM - Dev Edoofa: Sure, may I know till when will you be able to decide that?
29/1/24, 3:40 PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Naume!
I hope you are doing well and had a great weekend. May I know if you were able to discuss the breakup of finances for each month till November so that we can move forward accordingly?
29/1/24, 3:44 PM - +263 77 616 8836: Afternoon how are you
29/1/24, 3:44 PM - +263 77 616 8836: We will decide after the crop harvest
29/1/24, 3:46 PM - +263 77 616 8836: We will make sure that we will meet all the requirements needed for to proceed with her scholarship
29/1/24, 4:05 PM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for letting us know but I want you to understand that we cannot provide Naume with the Edoofa Secure Plan until and unless we have proper breakup finances because there are 27 seats for this plan and there are many students who are elegible for this seat. But since Naume has been one of the most dedicated students with great aspirations, I don't want her to miss out on this opportunity. I hope you understand?
29/1/24, 4:14 PM - +263 77 616 8836: Okey let's discuss on Wednesday at 1130.
29/1/24, 5:16 PM - Dev Edoofa: Sure, @263776168836! We will reconnect on Wednesday to move forward with the discussion. Till then I wish you a great evening ahead.
