For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts, I will explain to you it in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them.

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
2/1/24, 10:43 AM - +263 71 231 2401: Yes we can
2/1/24, 10:44 AM - Dev Edoofa: <Media omitted>
2/1/24, 10:46 AM - +263 71 231 2401: I'm done
2/1/24, 10:50 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
2/1/24, 10:50 AM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
2/1/24, 10:52 AM - +263 71 231 2401: Yes they are
2/1/24, 10:53 AM - Dev Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
2/1/24, 10:53 AM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
2/1/24, 10:54 AM - +263 71 231 2401: Yes I am
2/1/24, 10:57 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
2/1/24, 10:58 AM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
2/1/24, 11:00 AM - +263 71 231 2401: Yes very clear
2/1/24, 11:04 AM - Dev Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
2/1/24, 11:05 AM - +263 71 231 2401: Yes we can
2/1/24, 11:10 AM - Dev Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
2/1/24, 11:10 AM - Dev Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding you are ready, shall we start with our discussion with me individually? 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
2/1/24, 11:14 AM - +263 71 231 2401: Yes you can  share the videos
2/1/24, 11:17 AM - Dev Edoofa: *Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students*

This is a video by the founders of EDOOFA, in which they share 2 important qualities of successful Edoofians- who've secured a maximum scholarship and earned scholarship credits.

https://youtu.be/SIh6DcQsqYM

4/1/24, 1:13 PM - +263 71 231 2401: Question 2
Primary memory refers to a group of chips inside the processing unit where data and instructions are held whilst processing takes place. It is fast and reliable to use. Data can be instantly accessed due to its proximity of the processor. Primary storage is also known as Main memory or Immediate access storage. It can be used for input of data before processing. It is grouped into RAM and ROM. RAM IS volatile which means it loses its contents when power is switched. ROM standing for read only memory cannot be arased. They are 2 types of RAM  memory  dynamic and static. 

Secondary storage is devices used to data and programs for future use. For secondary we have magnetic storage and magnetic tapes. We also have hard drives and disketes.Secondary storage can also be called Backing storage, Auxillary storage and external storage <This message was edited>
4/1/24, 1:16 PM - +263 71 231 2401: Question 3
4/1/24, 1:32 PM - +263 71 231 2401: The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a conceptual framework that defines a networking architecture and establishes a set of rules and protocols for how different computer systems should communicate with each other. It is used to standardize the communication process between multiple devices and networks.

The model is divided into seven layers, each responsible for a specific set of tasks. These layers work in a hierarchical manner and ensure that data can flow seamlessly from one system to another. The layers are as follows:

1. Physical Layer: This layer deals with the transmission of raw data bits over physical communication media, such as cables or wireless signals. It defines the electrical, mechanical, and physical specifications of the network.

2. Data Link Layer: The data link layer provides reliable point-to-point or point-to-multipoint communication between devices on the same network. It is responsible for error detection and correction of the physical layer, as well as organizing data into frames for transmission.

3. Network Layer: The network layer handles the addressing, routing, and forwarding of data packets across different networks. It chooses the best path for delivering data from a source to a destination based on the network's topology and congestion.

4. Transport Layer: The transport layer ensures that data is reliably and accurately transported between the source and destination. It establishes a connection, breaks data into segments, adds sequence numbers for reassembling at the destination, and provides flow control and error recovery mechanisms.

5. Session Layer: The session layer establishes, manages, and terminates communication sessions between devices. It allows two systems to establish a session, coordinate the dialogue between them, and ensure that it is properly closed when the session ends.

6. Presentation Layer: The presentation layer is responsible for the formatting, encryption, and compression of data to be transmitted over the network. It ensures that the data sent by one system is readable by the receiving system.

7. Application Layer: The application layer provides services to end-users and enables them to access various network resources. It includes protocols for specific applications such as email, web browsing, file transfer, and remote access.
4/1/24, 1:41 PM - +263 71 231 2401: Fourth Question
Operator overloading is a feature available in C++, Python, and Java that allows programmers to redefine the behavior of operators for specific classes or types.

In C++:
- C++ offers extensive support for operator overloading. Programmers can define how operators such as +, -, *, /, etc., should behave for their own classes or data types by overloading them.
- Operator overloading in C++ is achieved by defining specific member functions or global functions with special syntax and naming conventions.

In Python:
- Python also supports operator overloading but approaches it in a different way compared to C++.
- In Python, operator overloading is achieved by implementing special methods or functions, often referred to as magic methods or dunder methods, with double underscores (__).
- These magic methods are called by the interpreter when specific operators are used on objects of user-defined classes.

In Java:
- Java, on the other hand, does not directly support operator overloading.
- In Java, the behavior of operators is fixed and predefined for each data type, and it is not possible to overload them or redefine their behavior.
- However, Java does provide some limited form of operator overloading for string concatenation, where the '+' operator can concatenate strings together.

It's important to note that while C++ offers more flexibility and control over operator overloading, Python and Java have their own ways of achieving similar results or providing alternative features to manipulate objects with operators. <This message was edited>

15/1/24, 11:07 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that!
15/1/24, 11:07 AM - Dev Edoofa: With great excitement and pride, I want to share that over the past few days, the Edoofa team has been immersed in an exciting event we had in store for our students. Edoofa hosted a conference - the Symposium of Leaders, Innovators, and Creators at Edoofa, also known as 'SLICE-CON.'

The conference was attended by all the Edoofians of 2023 and a few senior Edoofians from previous batches. It focused on the art of creation, innovation, and, most importantly, the mindset required to make an impact in one's career.
15/1/24, 11:07 AM - Dev Edoofa: During this Industrial Visit and the conference - SLICE CON, Corporate leaders, such as the CEOs and Co-founders from renowned companies like Rage Coffee, Sirona Hygiene, Jolin New York, and more, shared their insights and experience. These individuals are at the helm of multi-millionaire brands, leading large marketing teams. Their presence added immense value, providing students with the opportunity to engage in transformative conversations.
15/1/24, 11:07 AM - Dev Edoofa: We believe that interactions with such industry leaders can bring significant transformations to students' lives, enhancing their business acumen. Our Edoofians maximized this opportunity, having life-changing conversations with these influential figures. The main objective of the event was to emphasize the importance of thinking outside the box, encouraging students to believe in themselves and their dreams. Before we start our session today, I wanted to share a glimpse of the event, and I hope you are excited to attend similar events when you come to India.
15/1/24, 11:08 AM - Dev Edoofa: <Media omitted>
15/1/24, 11:08 AM - Dev Edoofa: <Media omitted>
15/1/24, 11:13 AM - +263 73 478 3724: Good to hear
15/1/24, 11:16 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to know that!
15/1/24, 11:18 AM - Dev Edoofa: Do you want to see Chidochashe attend these kinds of conference when she comes to India for her higher education?
15/1/24, 11:19 AM - +263 73 478 3724: Yes. Exposure is key to our children. You learn a lot if you get exposed to such conferences
15/1/24, 11:26 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that! On that note, let us start with our session!
15/1/24, 11:42 AM - +263 73 478 3724: Well noted
15/1/24, 11:45 AM - Dev Edoofa: That is great to know!  we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey. we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*.
15/1/24, 11:46 AM - Dev Edoofa: However, before we do the same, I was going through your scholarship application file and noticed that you are supposed to make the payment of your remaining part of Edoofa Enrollment fee. Hence, I thought of sharing a gentle reminder with you and trying to understand how your preparation has been so far? Have you been able to align your preparations in the right direction?
15/1/24, 11:49 AM - +263 73 478 3724: Thank you for the reminder. All is on course. I am anticipating my salary to come through end of this week or early next week. This payment will be on top of the priority list.
15/1/24, 11:49 AM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. We will reconnect with each other a few days before your due date to take a follow up on this and understand your preparations better,
15/1/24, 11:50 AM - Dev Edoofa: In the meantime. Let us move forward with our discussion. To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is B.Tech (Computer Science Engineering) and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2025. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
15/1/24, 11:50 AM - +263 73 478 3724: Great. We can do that.
15/1/24, 11:50 AM - +263 73 478 3724: Correct.
15/1/24, 11:52 AM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. Based on our experience of over 14 years and having assisted over 5000 students from different countries, we have realized that financial planning is the most important factor when a student plans for his/her higher education abroad.
15/1/24, 11:52 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am sure that you must be aware that 20-30% of students who are admitted into universities abroad are unable to fulfill their dream and come to India due to a lack of financial planning. The funds needed for booking flights, accommodation, and covering living expenses after arrival often become overwhelming, leading to the decision to defer their admission for a year. This, in turn, creates a gap in the child's education.
15/1/24, 11:52 AM - Dev Edoofa: To assist both students and parents in this regard, Edoofa Management has designed a Financial Secure Plan that aims to help you prepare for your higher educational finances without experiencing stress or last-minute rushes. I believe you must be wondering about the details of the same plan and how it helps the parents?
15/1/24, 11:54 AM - +263 73 478 3724: Good idea. Please share more details
15/1/24, 11:59 AM - Dev Edoofa: Edoofa Secure Plan is important for parents who have children joining the university for tertiary education in the next one to two years for several reasons:

*Financial Preparedness:* The Edoofa Secure plan helps parents prepare financially for the costs after the Scholarship being offered so that they are not caught off guard.

*Reduced Financial Stress:* Having the Edoofa Secure Plan in place can significantly reduce the financial stress on you as parents when your child is about to enter university. Knowing that there is a dedicated fund for education expenses provides peace of mind.
15/1/24, 11:59 AM - Dev Edoofa: *Avoiding Debt*: Without proper savings, some parents may resort to taking out loans or accumulating credit card debt to cover their child's education costs. This Educational savings plan helps avoid the burden of debt and high-interest payments.

*Compound Interest:* By starting to save early and consistently contributing to the savings plan, parents can take advantage of compound interest, which can significantly increase the amount available for education expenses.
15/1/24, 11:59 AM - Dev Edoofa: *Flexibility and Control:* The Edoofa Secure savings plans allow parents to have greater control over their finances and how they allocate funds for their child's education. They can choose investment options that align with their risk tolerance and financial goals.

*Encouraging Responsibility*: Involving your child in the process of saving for their education teaches them financial responsibility and the value of higher education. It also motivates them to outperform in Academics.
15/1/24, 11:59 AM - Dev Edoofa: *Adapting to Unexpected Changes*: Life is full of surprises, and circumstances can change especially when there are political reforms changing each day impacting the Local Currency. Having an Edoofa Secure Plan allows parents to adapt to unexpected changes in their financial situation while still prioritizing their child's education.

*Peace of Mind:* Overall, having the Edoofa Secure plan provides parents with peace of mind, knowing that they are actively planning for their child's future and increasing the likelihood of providing them with a solid education.
15/1/24, 11:59 AM - Dev Edoofa: Now, when you go through all the above benefits, I am sure you can see that the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan is an important financial tool for parents/students who are supposed to enter the university soon. 

It helps ensure that the financial aspect of tertiary education is well-managed, reduces stress, and allows parents to provide the best opportunities for their children without resorting to debt or financial hardship. Isn't this something you and your family also wish to have?
15/1/24, 12:06 PM - +263 73 478 3724: What a nobble plan. It is worth starting
15/1/24, 12:08 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through the above points, do you want me to help you understand how the Edoofa Secure Plan works?
15/1/24, 12:10 PM - +263 73 478 3724: Yes please
15/1/24, 12:12 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, as you are aware, we are currently in January 2024, and we have a good 20-21 months to plan for your finances before you start your university education in 2025.
15/1/24, 12:12 PM - Dev Edoofa: During the counseling session, you were informed that at Edoofa, we guarantee a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship on the tuition fees. Hence, the cost of education, including food and accommodation after the scholarship, would be between $2000-$3000, and it could be even less. Not more than that.
15/1/24, 12:12 PM - Dev Edoofa: This means that if you can save $150 per month for the next 20 months, you will be able to save $3000. This amount is more than enough for the first year of university fees, including tuition fees (if any), food, and accommodation. I hope you agree with this?
15/1/24, 12:15 PM - +263 73 478 3724: Sure
15/1/24, 12:19 PM - Dev Edoofa: Right, this means that by the time you would be in India, you would have already saved the $3000 that will cover the first-year fee.
15/1/24, 12:19 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, in these next 20 months, I am sure you would also be engaged in the EWYL program, and if you secure a minimum of $1000 in 20 months, that means the fees for 1.5 years are already secured.
15/1/24, 12:19 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, for a 3-year course, if we follow the same approach for the remaining 1.5 years, the educational journey for the student and the financial journey for the parent will be easy and smooth. I believe you must be able to see this perspective?
15/1/24, 12:54 PM - Dev Edoofa: Are you still available? @263734783724
15/1/24, 1:22 PM - +263 73 478 3724: I see.
15/1/24, 1:22 PM - +263 73 478 3724: Sorry had a few issues to attend to at work
15/1/24, 1:23 PM - Dev Edoofa: No worries. I completely understand.
15/1/24, 1:23 PM - Dev Edoofa: With that said, there is also another benefit, I am sure being in Zimbabwe you know how drastically the exchange rate fluctuates.
15/1/24, 1:23 PM - Dev Edoofa: If you are buying a dollar today, you might be spending 7000 bonds, but if you buy a dollar after a month, the rate would be different.
15/1/24, 1:23 PM - Dev Edoofa: Also, even if you choose to buy dollars every month and save at your home, it is not safe since there is news of robbery, and mugging every day.
15/1/24, 1:23 PM - Dev Edoofa: In that case, you will opt to save in the Bank, but again we know that savings in the Bank require a Nostro Account which means you have to pay the bank to keep your money safe, right?
15/1/24, 1:24 PM - +263 73 478 3724: 100% correct
15/1/24, 1:25 PM - Dev Edoofa: That is great to hear, considering these constraints, Edoofa Management has decided to help the parents and students prepare for the journey way ahead of time by helping them save money with Edoofa without any additional charges but rather saving additional money as well. Do you want me to explain how this has been achieved?
15/1/24, 1:27 PM - +263 73 478 3724: Sure. Please explain
15/1/24, 1:28 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Program Fee (Enrollment Fee) that you were asked to pay is $350. From the $350, you have already paid $200, and the remaining $150 is what you are planning to pay by tomorrow before your due date of 27-January-2024
15/1/24, 1:29 PM - Dev Edoofa: Under the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan, a parent has to deposit a small amount of money which is $150 every month for the next 10 months. 

That means, in 10 months, the money saved will be $1500. When this money is saved, Edoofa will waive off the remaining $150 which was due from the Edoofa Program/Enrollment Fee of $350, thereby making a straight saving of $150 in 10 months.
15/1/24, 1:29 PM - Dev Edoofa: Imagine you paying $15 every month to the Bank of Zimbabwe to keep your money safe, and here Edoofa is paying you $15 every month to keep your money safe. Now, you must be wondering, why only for 10 months and not for 20 months, right?
15/1/24, 1:32 PM - +263 73 478 3724: This is good
15/1/24, 1:33 PM - +263 73 478 3724: I am willing to consider this option
15/1/24, 1:33 PM - Dev Edoofa: If you see the bigger picture, you will realize that the reason is quite simple. Upon the completion of the 10 installments, the Edoofa Admissions team will initiate the Child’s Admission Process by applying early to the universities to secure their scholarship and their university seat.
15/1/24, 1:33 PM - Dev Edoofa: Reserving seats earlier increases the chances of obtaining a maximum scholarship. A higher scholarship means lower fees, and by securing the seat, you will be entitled to pay the fees as per the old fee structure of the university, not the new one implemented in January 2025. Furthermore, when applying to the universities, you will receive an offer letter or a letter of intent detailing the fees, scholarship, and registration fee.
15/1/24, 1:33 PM - Dev Edoofa: As explained during the enrollment process, the registration fee is a portion of your first-year university fee, paid to reserve the seat. It ranges from $500-$1000 and is not an additional fee. 

From the $1500 you saved with Edoofa, the registration fee will be paid to the university, securing the seat. For instance, if the registration fee is $1000, Edoofa will pay $1000 from the $1500 saved in 10 months. The updated balance with Edoofa will be $500, which will be paid to the university upon your arrival in India.
15/1/24, 1:33 PM - Dev Edoofa: This eases the financial burden on the parent, as there is no immediate payment required upon the student's arrival. The $500 saved will cover the remaining fees for the semester/year, as specified in the offer letter from the university. What are your thoughts on this?
15/1/24, 1:39 PM - +263 73 478 3724: Well understood
15/1/24, 1:39 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to see that we are together so far. With this plan for the next 10 months, I am sure you must be wondering what will happen in the next 10 months, considering you have already secured your scholarship seat with the university due to your hard work in the first 10 months. Is my understanding correct?
15/1/24, 1:43 PM - +263 73 478 3724: Will need to plan and see when will I create space to start this
15/1/24, 1:44 PM - Dev Edoofa: Yes, @263734783724, Surely!
15/1/24, 1:45 PM - Dev Edoofa: Do you want to know how do we proceed after depositing $150 for 10 months?
15/1/24, 1:45 PM - +263 73 478 3724: Yes. Please explain
15/1/24, 1:47 PM - Dev Edoofa: Let me help you with that as well. In the 11th month, you will be guided to open an FBC Mastercard bank account in Zimbabwe with a deposit of $150. The reason for this is that when you apply for your student Visa, the Embassy asks for a Bank Statement, and this account will serve that purpose.
15/1/24, 1:47 PM - Dev Edoofa: We understand it might be expensive if you deposit another $1500 for the remaining 10 months in FB  Bank Zimbabwe, so to avoid the same challenges, we have designed the plan accordingly. You will only be depositing for the 11th, 12th, 13th, and 14th month, which is 4 months.
15/1/24, 1:47 PM - Dev Edoofa: Once the 4 months are completed, our Department of Student Welfare (DSW) team will assist you with your visa process. The bank statement will act as one of the required documents, and once you receive the visa, you can withdraw the amount from FBC and book the flight ticket. This will help you utilize the money as well. How does it sound?
15/1/24, 1:49 PM - +263 73 478 3724: Quite an eye opener
15/1/24, 1:51 PM - Dev Edoofa: That is good to know! Now, from the 16th Month till the 20th month, considering it is a 6-month window, you can again continue depositing the money ($150) with Edoofa which can be used in the fee as and when required or you can decide to save this $900 of these 6 months with you as well. This is something which you are free to choose. I hope you have understood the financial secure plan now?
15/1/24, 1:53 PM - +263 73 478 3724: Understood
15/1/24, 1:55 PM - Dev Edoofa: That's great. Now that you have all the information, I want you to take some time and discuss the financial security plan with your family members. Help them understand its importance and details. Once you're done, we can reconnect, have a discussion, and address any queries you may have. After resolving your concerns, I'll guide you through starting your financial security plan. 
Could you let me know when you think you'll have the discussion with your family? This way, we can schedule our next session accordingly.
15/1/24, 1:59 PM - +263 73 478 3724: Can discuss tomorrow and we connect on Wednesday
15/1/24, 1:59 PM - Dev Edoofa: That's perfectly fine. In that case, we will conclude today's conversation, and I will connect with you on Wednesday to resume our discussion. In the meantime, I hope you'll have a detailed discussion with your family and jot down any questions or thoughts you have regarding the Financial Secure plan.

Wishing you a good day ahead, and please extend our regards to your family.
15/1/24, 2:17 PM - +263 73 478 3724: Thank you
15/1/24, 2:20 PM - Dev Edoofa: You are most welcome.
20/1/24, 8:44 AM - Dev Edoofa: Good Morning Mr. and Mrs. Gurure and Chidochashe,

I hope you are doing well, and that this message finds you in the best of spirits. Please excuse me for not being able to connect with you in the past couple of days, I was a bit under the weather and had to take some time off to focus on my health.
20/1/24, 8:44 AM - Dev Edoofa: During this period, I couldn't communicate about my unavailability. However, I am feeling much better today and am available to resume all operations.
20/1/24, 8:44 AM - Dev Edoofa: This message was deleted
20/1/24, 9:01 AM - Dev Edoofa: Additionally, since it has been a while since we last connected, I was wondering how you and your family are doing?
27/1/24, 9:53 AM - Dev Edoofa: Good Morning Mr. and Mrs. Gurure!
I hope you are doing well and are having a wonderful start to the day. For the past few days, I have noticed that you are unresponsive and due to that, we were not able to take forward our conversation. I understand that Chidochashe is at school, and you may be busy with your work schedules, but, I would like to tell you that you need to be available for a couple of sessions only, and after that, we will have sessions on a need basis. So, may I know if you have any kind of challenges in attending the sessions for a couple of days? Please let us know about it as it will help us to align ourselves accordingly and help you tackle them as well.
30/1/24, 2:49 PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Chidochashe

I hope you are doing well. I was expecting a response from your end the past couple of days and hence I wanted to reach out to you once again and see if we are still connected. 

At the same time, I was going through your application file and as per the same, you are supposed to make the payment of your remaining part of the Edoofa Enrollment fee of $150 before 27 January 2024. 

In light of this, I wanted to reach out to you, share a gentle reminder, and try to understand if you have been able to make the payment of your fee by now so that we can update the academic board accordingly?
30/1/24, 5:37 PM - +263 73 478 3724: Good day to you. We are doing fine. Unfortunately it has been a bit hectic during the day and I ended up forgetting to communicate.

There has been a bad financial downturn this side. As a result, we will not be able to to meet our financial obligations in the next couple of months.

Sincere apologies please
30/1/24, 6:03 PM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for updating us on your situation. May I know what challenges you are facing financially? It will help us to understand your situation better and help you tackle them accordingly.
30/1/24, 6:14 PM - +263 73 478 3724: Demands for cash to fund the final stages of education for my daughter as well as my some extended family members has pushed me down such that I am now thinking of suspending this program. When I look at it, I won't be able to cope with the monthly savings I had committed to.
30/1/24, 6:23 PM - Dev Edoofa: If you don't mind, may I plesae ask you to please help me understand what your extended family members think about this?
30/1/24, 6:24 PM - +263 73 478 3724: I haven't told the extended family about it
30/1/24, 6:27 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am asking about, what were the circumstances that your extended family members have pushed you down that you are now thinking of suspending this program?
30/1/24, 6:41 PM - +263 73 478 3724: The biggest issue is that I need to first allocate resources for my daughter to pass her final exams right now. That's top priority. When I see her in safe position then I can relook at this. Extended family is the usual care I give to my own parents to enable survival. If I withdraw, I would have also made a blunder
30/1/24, 6:42 PM - +263 73 478 3724: I have to balance with the other kids who are also preparing for final exams next year
