For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts, I will explain to you it in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them.

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
3/1/24, 10:13 AM - +263 78 235 4301: Yes please
3/1/24, 10:15 AM - Dev Edoofa: <Media omitted>
3/1/24, 10:18 AM - +263 78 235 4301: I'm done
3/1/24, 11:06 AM - Dev Edoofa: There was a technical glitch which led to the delay. I hope you understand.
3/1/24, 11:06 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
3/1/24, 11:06 AM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
3/1/24, 11:30 AM - +263 78 235 4301: Yes they are clear.Thanks
3/1/24, 11:36 AM - Dev Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
3/1/24, 11:36 AM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
3/1/24, 11:57 AM - Dev Edoofa: Are you there Michelle?
3/1/24, 11:58 AM - +263 78 235 4301: Yes I'm here
3/1/24, 11:59 AM - Dev Edoofa: Okay, please let me know if you are clear about the above two steps?
3/1/24, 12:00 PM - +263 78 235 4301: Yes I'm clear
3/1/24, 12:01 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
3/1/24, 12:01 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
3/1/24, 12:05 PM - +263 78 235 4301: Yes they are
3/1/24, 12:08 PM - Dev Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
3/1/24, 12:08 PM - Dev Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding you are ready, shall we start with our discussion with me individually? 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
3/1/24, 12:13 PM - +263 78 235 4301: Yes
3/1/24, 12:19 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that!

8/1/24, 10:45 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that.
8/1/24, 10:47 AM - Dev Edoofa: So before moving forward, as I had asked before, May I please get to know your understanding of the 4 videos that were shared with you?
8/1/24, 10:53 AM - +263 78 235 4301: I managed to watch the first two videos and l understood the Edoofa's vision for us in the second video
8/1/24, 10:54 AM - +263 78 235 4301: The other two videos l will watch them when l get to where there is WiFi
8/1/24, 10:55 AM - Dev Edoofa: Okay, Michelle. I would recommend you to watch the videos as soon as possible, as the videos are essential for building a mindset of growth and proactiveness.
8/1/24, 10:56 AM - +263 78 235 4301: Yes l will
8/1/24, 10:57 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that!
8/1/24, 10:58 AM - Dev Edoofa: We will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.
8/1/24, 10:58 AM - +263 78 235 4301: Okay
8/1/24, 10:58 AM - Dev Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by tomorrow 12:30 PM.
8/1/24, 10:58 AM - Dev Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

16/1/24, 12:25 PM - Dev Edoofa: You are most welcome!
16/1/24, 8:47 PM - +263 78 235 4301: <Media omitted>
16/1/24, 9:00 PM - +263 78 235 4301: Question 2

-There are many areas under the umbrella nutrition that interest me, but I'm particularly drawn to clinical dietetics. I find it fascinating how nutrition can be used to prevent and treat diseases. I'm also interested in how diet can affect overall health and wellness. As a clinical dietitian, l want to focus on cancer nutrition. Cancer nutrition is a rapidly growing field within clinical dietitics. I wish to research in this area because it focuses on how nutrition can be used to support cancer patients before, during and after treatment. It also explores how diet may affect cancer risk and prevention. I want to research more on the impact of nutrition on cancer recurrence. I wish to know more on how the certain aspects of a person's diet may be linked to an increased risk of cancer coming back for example some researches have shown that a diet high on sugar may be linked to an increased risk or breast cancer recurrence. I would love to conduct research in this area to help improve people's lives through better nutrition.
16/1/24, 9:17 PM - Dev Edoofa: Since your EWYL session was not able to start on the agreed-upon date, They are prepared to initiate your EWYL program on Friday, 

To kickstart the process, your dedicated EWYL Mentor has established your EWYL Group and shared the invitation link with us. Here's what you and your parents/guardian/sponsor need to do:
16/1/24, 9:18 PM - Dev Edoofa: https://chat.whatsapp.com/JtxkeHtSAjM3wofljGrYtI

Use the above-provided link to join your group. Once both you and your parents have joined, please send the following message to the group:

*Dear Mentor, my name is Michelle Gorekore, and my EWYL group name is Michelle EWYL23E1085. I am excited to begin my EWYL Journey. As discussed with the admission team, I am committed to being available on 19/01/2024 to commence the procedures. Kindly schedule my session for the same date so that I can maximize the benefits and start on the right track.*" <This message was edited>
16/1/24, 9:18 PM - Dev Edoofa: Once you start with the EWYL Program and are able to connect with your mentor, please update the same here as well by sending the below message -

*Hello Admission officer, I am now in touch with my EWYL Mentor. The name of my Mentor is _________ and he/she has scheduled my session for ________*(mention the date)
16/1/24, 9:19 PM - +263 78 235 4301: Question 3

-There are several common nutritional diseases that can affect children and can often be corrected through dietary changes. One example is iron deficiency anemia, which is a condition where the body doesn't have enough iron. This canead to fatigue, weakness and other health problems. It can be corrected by increasing iron  intake through food or supplements. Another example is Vitamin D deficiency, which can cause rickets in children. This can be corrected by getting more vitamin D through food or supplements. There is also protein - energy  malnutrition which is a lack of proteins and calories in the diet. This can cause growth failure, muscle wasting and other problems in children. In order to correct this, it's important to increase protein and calorie intake through a healthy diet. Next we can talk about goiter which is caused by lack of iodine. This can be corrected through eating sea foods and iodized salt. There is also lack of zinc which causes stunted growth, diarrhea and can be corrected by increasing zinc intake through foods like meats, legumes and whole grains. Lastly there is fluoride deficiency which can cause dental caries or cavities in children. This can be corrected by increasing fluoride intake through fluoridated water or supplements
16/1/24, 9:52 PM - +263 78 235 4301: Question 4

Micro nutrients are nutrients that the body needs in smaller amounts and macro nutrients are nutrients that the body needs in large amounts. Examples of macro nutrients include carbohydrates, proteins and fats. Carbohydrates are the main source of energy in the body and are found in foods like bread, rice and pasta. Fats are also a source of energy and they provide warmth. They are found in foods like oils,nuts and avocados. Proteins are also essential in the body. There are two main types of proteins : complete and incomplete proteins. Complete proteins contain all essential amino acids the body needs. They are found in animal sources like meat, fish, poultry and dairy products. Incomplete proteins also known as low quality proteins are missing one or more essential amino acids. They are found in plant sources like legumes.,nuts and grains. Examples of micro nutrients are vitamins, minerals, calcium, iron and magnesium. Vitamin D is for bone health, calcium absorption and immune function. Vitamin A is for vision  and skin health. Vitamin E is an antioxidant that helps protect cells from damage. Vitamin K is for blood clotting and bone health. Calcium is for bone health,muscle function and blood cell production. Iron is for red blood cell production and magnesium is for nerve and muscle function.
16/1/24, 10:05 PM - +263 78 235 4301: Noted
17/1/24, 7:01 AM - Dev Edoofa: Good Morning Michelle and Parents! I hope you are doing great! We will have our session today at 2:30pm to take forward our conversation.
17/1/24, 7:02 AM - +263 78 235 4301: Morning we are doing well thanks
17/1/24, 7:02 AM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the screenshot of SOP and answers. I have taken note of it and will update it in our records as well. <This message was edited>
17/1/24, 7:03 AM - +263 78 235 4301: Thank you
17/1/24, 2:44 PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Afternoon Michelle and Parents!
How are you all doing?
17/1/24, 2:55 PM - +263 78 235 4301: We're doing well thanks
17/1/24, 3:01 PM - Dev Edoofa: That is great!
17/1/24, 3:02 PM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the screenshots and answers to the document. We have taken note of it and will update them in our records!
17/1/24, 3:03 PM - Dev Edoofa: With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey. we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*.
17/1/24, 3:03 PM - Dev Edoofa: Let us move forward with our discussion. To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is B.Sc (Nutrition and Dietetics) and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2025. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
17/1/24, 3:04 PM - +263 78 235 4301: Yes it is accurate
17/1/24, 3:08 PM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. Based on our experience of over 14 years and having assisted over 5000 students from different countries, we have realized that financial planning is the most important factor when a student plans for his/her higher education abroad.
17/1/24, 3:08 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am sure that you must be aware that 20-30% of students who are admitted into universities abroad are unable to fulfill their dream and come to India due to a lack of financial planning. The funds needed for booking flights, accommodation, and covering living expenses after arrival often become overwhelming, leading to the decision to defer their admission for a year. This, in turn, creates a gap in the child's education.
17/1/24, 3:08 PM - Dev Edoofa: To assist both students and parents in this regard, Edoofa Management has designed a Financial Secure Plan that aims to help you prepare for your higher educational finances without experiencing stress or last-minute rushes. I believe you must be wondering about the details of the same plan and how it helps the parents?
17/1/24, 3:33 PM - +263 78 235 4301: Yes
17/1/24, 3:41 PM - Dev Edoofa: Edoofa Secure Plan is important for parents who have children joining the university for tertiary education in the next one to two years for several reasons:

*Financial Preparedness:* The Edoofa Secure plan helps parents prepare financially for the costs after the Scholarship being offered so that they are not caught off guard.

*Reduced Financial Stress:* Having the Edoofa Secure Plan in place can significantly reduce the financial stress on you as parents when your child is about to enter university. Knowing that there is a dedicated fund for education expenses provides peace of mind.
17/1/24, 3:41 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Avoiding Debt*: Without proper savings, some parents may resort to taking out loans or accumulating credit card debt to cover their child's education costs. This Educational savings plan helps avoid the burden of debt and high-interest payments.

*Compound Interest:* By starting to save early and consistently contributing to the savings plan, parents can take advantage of compound interest, which can significantly increase the amount available for education expenses.
17/1/24, 3:41 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Flexibility and Control:* The Edoofa Secure savings plans allow parents to have greater control over their finances and how they allocate funds for their child's education. They can choose investment options that align with their risk tolerance and financial goals.

*Encouraging Responsibility*: Involving your child in the process of saving for their education teaches them financial responsibility and the value of higher education. It also motivates them to outperform in Academics.
17/1/24, 3:41 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Adapting to Unexpected Changes*: Life is full of surprises, and circumstances can change especially when there are political reforms changing each day impacting the Local Currency. Having an Edoofa Secure Plan allows parents to adapt to unexpected changes in their financial situation while still prioritizing their child's education.

*Peace of Mind:* Overall, having the Edoofa Secure plan provides parents with peace of mind, knowing that they are actively planning for their child's future and increasing the likelihood of providing them with a solid education.
17/1/24, 3:41 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, when you go through all the above benefits, I am sure you can see that the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan is an important financial tool for parents/students who are supposed to enter the university soon. 

It helps ensure that the financial aspect of tertiary education is well-managed, reduces stress, and allows parents to provide the best opportunities for their children without resorting to debt or financial hardship. Isn't this something you and your family also wish to have?
17/1/24, 4:40 PM - +263 78 235 4301: Yes it is
17/1/24, 4:47 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through the above points, do you want me to help you understand how the Edoofa Secure Plan works?
17/1/24, 4:49 PM - +263 78 235 4301: Yes please
17/1/24, 5:01 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, as you are aware, we are currently in January 2024, and we have a good 20-21 months to plan for your finances before you start your university education in 2025.
17/1/24, 5:01 PM - Dev Edoofa: During the counseling session, you were informed that at Edoofa, we guarantee a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship on the tuition fees. Hence, the cost of education, including food and accommodation after the scholarship, would be between $2000-$3000, and it could be even less. Not more than that.
17/1/24, 5:01 PM - Dev Edoofa: This means that if you can save $150 per month for the next 20 months, you will be able to save $3000. This amount is more than enough for the first year of university fees, including tuition fees (if any), food, and accommodation. I hope you agree with this?
17/1/24, 5:04 PM - +263 78 235 4301: Yes l do
17/1/24, 5:09 PM - Dev Edoofa: Right, this means that by the time you would be in India, you would have already saved the $3000 that will cover the first-year fee.
17/1/24, 5:09 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, in these next 20 months, I am sure you would also be engaged in the EWYL program, and if you secure a minimum of $1000 in 20 months, that means the fees for 1.5 years are already secured.
17/1/24, 5:09 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, for a 3-year course, if we follow the same approach for the remaining 1.5 years, the educational journey for the student and the financial journey for the parent will be easy and smooth. I believe you must be able to see this perspective?
17/1/24, 5:10 PM - +263 78 235 4301: Yes
17/1/24, 5:18 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. With that said, there is also another benefit, I am sure being in Zimbabwe you know how drastically the exchange rate fluctuates.
17/1/24, 5:18 PM - Dev Edoofa: If you are buying a dollar today, you might be spending 7000 bonds, but if you buy a dollar after a month, the rate would be different.
17/1/24, 5:18 PM - Dev Edoofa: Also, even if you choose to buy dollars every month and save at your home, it is not safe since there is news of robbery, and mugging every day.
17/1/24, 5:18 PM - Dev Edoofa: In that case, you will opt to save in the Bank, but again we know that savings in the Bank require a Nostro Account which means you have to pay the bank to keep your money safe, right?
17/1/24, 5:20 PM - +263 78 235 4301: Yes
17/1/24, 5:22 PM - Dev Edoofa: That is great to hear, considering these constraints, Edoofa Management has decided to help the parents and students prepare for the journey way ahead of time by helping them save money with Edoofa without any additional charges but rather saving additional money as well. Do you want me to explain how this has been achieved?
17/1/24, 5:23 PM - +263 78 235 4301: Yes please
17/1/24, 5:26 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Program Fee (Enrollment Fee) that you were asked to pay is $350.
17/1/24, 5:26 PM - Dev Edoofa: Under the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan, a parent has to deposit a small amount of money which is $150 every month for the next 10 months. 

That means, in 10 months, the money saved will be $1500.
17/1/24, 5:26 PM - Dev Edoofa: Imagine you paying $15 every month to the Bank of Zimbabwe to keep your money safe, and here Edoofa is paying you $15 every month to keep your money safe. Now, you must be wondering, why only for 10 months and not for 20 months, right?
17/1/24, 5:45 PM - +263 78 235 4301: Yes
17/1/24, 5:49 PM - Dev Edoofa: If you see the bigger picture, you will realize that the reason is quite simple. Upon the completion of the 10 installments, the Edoofa Admissions team will initiate the Child’s Admission Process by applying early to the universities to secure their scholarship and their university seat.
17/1/24, 5:49 PM - Dev Edoofa: Reserving seats earlier increases the chances of obtaining a maximum scholarship. A higher scholarship means lower fees, and by securing the seat, you will be entitled to pay the fees as per the old fee structure of the university, not the new one implemented in January 2025. Furthermore, when applying to the universities, you will receive an offer letter or a letter of intent detailing the fees, scholarship, and registration fee.
17/1/24, 5:49 PM - Dev Edoofa: As explained during the enrollment process, the registration fee is a portion of your first-year university fee, paid to reserve the seat. It ranges from $500-$1000 and is not an additional fee. 

From the $1500 you saved with Edoofa, the registration fee will be paid to the university, securing the seat. For instance, if the registration fee is $1000, Edoofa will pay $1000 from the $1500 saved in 10 months. The updated balance with Edoofa will be $500, which will be paid to the university upon your arrival in India.
17/1/24, 5:49 PM - Dev Edoofa: This eases the financial burden on the parent, as there is no immediate payment required upon the student's arrival. The $500 saved will cover the remaining fees for the semester/year, as specified in the offer letter from the university. What are your thoughts on this?
17/1/24, 5:57 PM - +263 78 235 4301: I think it's a good idea
17/1/24, 6:03 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to see that we are together so far. With this plan for the next 10 months, I am sure you must be wondering what will happen in the next 10 months, considering you have already secured your scholarship seat with the university due to your hard work in the first 10 months. Is my understanding correct?
17/1/24, 6:07 PM - +263 78 235 4301: Yes
17/1/24, 6:57 PM - Dev Edoofa: Let me help you with that as well. In the 11th month, you will be guided to open an FBC Mastercard bank account in Zimbabwe with a deposit of $150. The reason for this is that when you apply for your student Visa, the Embassy asks for a Bank Statement, and this account will serve that purpose.
17/1/24, 6:58 PM - Dev Edoofa: We understand it might be expensive if you deposit another $1500 for the remaining 10 months in FB  Bank Zimbabwe, so to avoid the same challenges, we have designed the plan accordingly. You will only be depositing for the 11th, 12th, 13th, and 14th month, which is 4 months.
17/1/24, 6:58 PM - Dev Edoofa: Once the 4 months are completed, our Department of Student Welfare (DSW) team will assist you with your visa process. The bank statement will act as one of the required documents, and once you receive the visa, you can withdraw the amount from FBC and book the flight ticket. This will help you utilize the money as well.
17/1/24, 6:58 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, from the 16th Month till the 20th month, considering it is a 6-month window, you can again continue depositing the money ($150) with Edoofa which can be used in the fee as and when required or you can decide to save this $900 of these 6 months with you as well. This is something which you are free to choose. I hope you have understood the financial secure plan now?
17/1/24, 9:00 PM - +263 78 235 4301: Yes l have
17/1/24, 10:16 PM - Dev Edoofa: That's great. Now that you have all the information, I want you to take some time and discuss the financial security plan with your family members. Help them understand its importance and details. Once you're done, we can reconnect, have a discussion, and address any queries you may have. After resolving your concerns, I'll guide you through starting your financial security plan.
17/1/24, 10:17 PM - Dev Edoofa: We will reconnect tomorrow at 4:30 PM to resume our discussion. In the meantime, I hope you'll have a detailed discussion with your family and jot down any questions or thoughts you have regarding the Financial Secure plan.

Wishing you a good night, and please extend our regards to your family.
20/1/24, 12:35 PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Michelle!

I hope you are doing well, and this message finds you in the best of spirits. Please excuse me for not being able to connect with you in the past couple of days, I was a bit under the weather and had to take some time off to focus on my health.
20/1/24, 12:35 PM - Dev Edoofa: During this period, I couldn't communicate about my unavailability. However, I am feeling much better today and am available to resume all operations.
20/1/24, 12:35 PM - Dev Edoofa: Additionally, since it has been a while since we last connected, I was wondering how you and your family are doing?
20/1/24, 1:16 PM - +263 78 235 4301: Good afternoon... We are doing well thanks
20/1/24, 1:16 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that! Before reaching out to you today, I was going through pictures and videos from Edoofa's very first SLICE CON held last week, and that sparked my curiosity about whether you are familiar with what SLICE CON is or not?
20/1/24, 1:19 PM - +263 78 235 4301: No I'm not familiar with it
20/1/24, 1:19 PM - Dev Edoofa: Let me tell you a bit about the same.  Recently, Edoofa hosted a conference called the Symposium of Leaders, Innovators, and Creators at Edoofa, also known as 'SLICE-CON.'
20/1/24, 1:19 PM - Dev Edoofa: The conference was attended by all the Edoofians of 2023 and a few senior Edoofians from previous batches. It focused on the art of creation, innovation, and, most importantly, the mindset required to make an impact in one's career.

Malnutrition refers to a condition in which an individual does not get the right amount or type of nutrients they need for their body to function properly. It can be broken down to under-nutrition and over-nutrition. Under-nutrition is when a person does not get enough nutrients, while over-nutrition is when a person gets many nutrients. Malnutrition, over-nutrition and under-nutrition can place a burden to the health care system. When people are suffering from under-nutrition they are likely to get sick and their illnesses are more severe and hard to treat. This can lead to more hospitalizations and longer stays in the hospital, which increases costs for the health care system. Over nutrition can also be a burden to the health care system. For example obesity can lead to chronic diseases like diabetes and heart disease which requires expensive and ongoing medical treatment. Obesity can lead to disability which further increases costs for the health care system. Steps that should be taken at grass root level to correct this situation are :
1.raise awareness about the issue and educate people about importance of a healthy diet.

2.improve access to nutritious foods especially to those who are most at risk for malnutrition.

3.Adress underlying causes of malnutrition.
