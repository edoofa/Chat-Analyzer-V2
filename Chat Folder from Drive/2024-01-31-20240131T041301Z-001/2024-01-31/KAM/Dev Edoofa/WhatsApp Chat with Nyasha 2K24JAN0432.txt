23/1/24, 9:16 AM - Dev Edoofa: Good Morning Mr. and Mrs. Mukarati and Nyasha!
I hope you are doing well. I understand your concern and I know that you are still in A- Level and have not appeared for the exams, so for the time being, you can request a letter of Recommendation from your school for which we have the following guidelines.
23/1/24, 9:16 AM - Dev Edoofa: Here are some key points to consider when requesting the letter from your school:

1. *Visit Your School*: Approach your school administration or the designated authority for issuing such letters.

2. *Provide Necessary Information*: Ensure that the drafted letter includes essential details such as your identity as a student of the school, your subject combination for A Level exams, and your intention to sit for the exams this academic year.

3. *Printing and Signing*: Request the school to print the letter on official letterhead and have it signed/stamped by the appropriate authority.

4. *Include Authority Details*: Ensure that the letter contains the details of the signing authority, including their full name, contact number, and email ID.
23/1/24, 9:20 AM - Dev Edoofa: Yes, Nyasha! You can change your course even after the results are declared, however, you need to understand that in the Indian Education System, your eligibility for a course depends on the combination of subjects the student had in school. I hope you understand what I am trying to convey?
23/1/24, 9:21 AM - Dev Edoofa: Okay, Nyasha, for today we can have our session at 1:00 pm.

26/1/24, 1:26 PM - Dev Edoofa: 1. The admissions group *Nyasha 2K24JAN0432*  will be the platform where we, as your admission officers, will be communicating with you. This group is dedicated to all-important discussions like your university admission process, offer letter discussion, and ultimately your university registration and reservation of your scholarship along with the Visa process. This group will continue to assist you with your admission-related queries while you are here in India.
26/1/24, 1:27 PM - Dev Edoofa: 2. Earn While You Learn Program *Nyasha EWYL23E1203*. In this group, your EWYL mentor, head of the department, and head coach will be present. With this group, we will make sure you are prepared to self-finance your education here in India. With your dedicated efforts in the EWYL program, you will earn maximum scholarship credits.

This group will keep a record of the tasks and projects you undertake. You will be provided with the link to the group after the completion of the admission process session and on the dedicated date for your EWYL session, where you will be able to directly speak to your EWYL mentor. I hope you are clear about the purpose of the two groups.
26/1/24, 1:29 PM - +263 71 692 1784: Yes it's clear
26/1/24, 1:31 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to know that you are clear about the purpose of the two WhatsApp groups and it's reassuring to hear this from your end. I also had a recent conversation with your counselor, during which he provided me with some insights into your academic background and career aspirations. I must commend you as a family, you must take great pride in your achievements and be dedicated to ensuring your access to the finest opportunities to launch your career.

Speaking of valuable opportunities, I am also curious to learn more about your counseling session with your counselor and to understand which aspects of the Edoofa Scholarship Program have particularly impressed you thus far. Can you share this with me?
26/1/24, 1:37 PM - +263 71 692 1784: l learned more about Edoofa scholarship through my counselor and I was impressed by many things .l was impressed by the EWYL program and that if l involve myself into this program my parents won't be burdened by the university costs .
l was also impressed that Edoofa will be with me till l finish my studies in India
26/1/24, 1:40 PM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for the kind words of feedback, Nyasha! I have known Mr. Kunal for a long time and he always ensures that each and every student of his gets personalized attention so that he can ensure their academic career is on track.

EWYL program provides the opportunity to the hardworking students to self-finance their higher education on top of the scholarship provided in the Edoofa scholarship program.
This program also assists the students to have a finesse on skills that are pre-requisites before venturing into any field and climb the ladder of success.
26/1/24, 1:41 PM - Dev Edoofa: Moving forward in today's session, we will discuss a bit about your university admission journey. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts. I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them.

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
26/1/24, 1:42 PM - +263 71 692 1784: Yes
26/1/24, 1:42 PM - Dev Edoofa: <Media omitted>
26/1/24, 1:45 PM - +263 71 692 1784: l am done
26/1/24, 1:46 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
26/1/24, 1:46 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
26/1/24, 1:50 PM - +263 71 692 1784: Yes
26/1/24, 1:50 PM - Dev Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps - 

*Step 3: Introduction to the Financial Secure Plan* - Parents with children embarking on their university journey within the next one to two years face important decision-making and rigorous financial planning. Edoofa recognizes the significance of this transition and hence has introduced the Edoofa Secure Plan - a unique and systematic strategy to empower parents in financial planning and preparing for their child's tertiary education well in advance.
26/1/24, 1:50 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Scholarship Offer Letter from the university would be issued next year in the month of August.

I hope you are following?
26/1/24, 1:52 PM - +263 71 692 1784: Yes l am
26/1/24, 1:57 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. The registration fee will be paid through the savings you have accumulated visa the Financial Secure Plan. After the registration fee is paid, for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
26/1/24, 1:57 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
26/1/24, 1:58 PM - +263 71 692 1784: It's all clear
26/1/24, 2:04 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through all 6 steps, if we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
26/1/24, 2:05 PM - +263 71 692 1784: Yes l will be available for stage one only
26/1/24, 2:05 PM - +263 71 692 1784: For today
26/1/24, 2:05 PM - Dev Edoofa: Sure, Nyasha!
26/1/24, 2:06 PM - Dev Edoofa: In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
26/1/24, 2:06 PM - Dev Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding.

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you? <This message was edited>
26/1/24, 2:11 PM - Dev Edoofa: Shall I share the videos? <This message was edited>

Founders talk about their decade-long journey of discovering these schools and the experiences that students are having in these schools.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DW82emflFHw&feature=youtu.be
26/1/24, 2:14 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP*

The fourth video is about the Statement of Purpose (SOP). The most important step towards securing a good scholarship is to write the Statement of Purpose but to know why it is important, watching this video will clear your doubts and questions.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftsGGGBYMrs&feature=youtu.be
26/1/24, 2:16 PM - Dev Edoofa: I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection. 

Please go through the 4 videos, our next session will be scheduled for tomorrow after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarize your understanding. Hence, I would like you to watch the videos by today. We will have our session tomorrow at 12:30 PM to take forward our session.

I hope you are doing well and had a wonderful weekend. I was hoping to get a response from your side in your last session. However, since you were not available for the session, we were not able to take forward your admission journey. So, may I know if you are going to be comfortable with taking forward our conversation today? I also want to iterate that delays can seriously affect your admission journey.

29/1/24, 4:48 PM - +263 71 692 1784: Ok
29/1/24, 4:49 PM - Dev Edoofa: Glad to hear that.

29/1/24, 4:49 PM - Dev Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded.

30/1/24, 10:08 AM - Dev Edoofa: Good Morning Mr. & Mrs. Mukarati and Nyasha!
I hope you are doing well. Thank you for sharing the responses to the document. I have taken complete note of it and will update it in our records. Please fill the the SOP form as well before our session, so that we can take forward our conversation during our session at 12:30pm.
30/1/24, 10:10 AM - Dev Edoofa: I want to also assist you in getting started with your EWYL Journey. Based on your EWYL application form, you are scheduled to commence your EWYL journey today (30th January).
30/1/24, 10:10 AM - Dev Edoofa: With your intention and commencement date in mind, we have already communicated this information to the EWYL team. They are prepared to initiate your EWYL program today, as previously agreed upon.

To kick-start the process, your dedicated EWYL Mentor has established your EWYL Group and shared the invitation link with us. Here's what you and your parents/guardian/sponsor need to do:
30/1/24, 10:12 AM - Dev Edoofa: https://chat.whatsapp.com/EVCLWeYcYMe2ndmqMTDUpi

"Use the above-provided link to join your group. Once both you and your parents have joined, please send the following message to the group:

*Dear Mentor, my name is Nyasha Mukarati, and my EWYL group name is Nyasha EWYL23E1203. I am excited to begin my EWYL Journey.

30/1/24, 10:12 AM - Dev Edoofa: Once you start with the EWYL Program and are able to connect with your mentor, please update the same here as well by sending the below message -

*Hello Admission officer, I am now in touch with my EWYL Mentor. The name of my Mentor is _________ and he/she has scheduled my session for ________*(mention the date)
30/1/24, 10:12 AM - Dev Edoofa: I hope these instructions are clear?
30/1/24, 1:13 PM - +263 71 692 1784: Yes they are clear
30/1/24, 1:27 PM - Dev Edoofa: That is good to know, you can follow the instructions now.
30/1/24, 1:28 PM - Dev Edoofa: Also, may I know if you were able to fill the SOP form?
30/1/24, 3:41 PM - +263 71 692 1784: <Media omitted>
30/1/24, 3:42 PM - +263 71 692 1784: Yes l did
30/1/24, 3:47 PM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. I have taken note of it and the responses as well. I will update this in our records as well.
30/1/24, 4:12 PM - +263 71 692 1784: Ok thank you
30/1/24, 4:12 PM - Dev Edoofa: You are most welcome.
30/1/24, 4:12 PM - Dev Edoofa: With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey, i.e. *Introduction to Financial Secure Plan*.
30/1/24, 4:13 PM - +263 71 692 1784: Ok
30/1/24, 4:13 PM - Dev Edoofa: However, before we start the same, I was going through your scholarship application file and noticed that you are supposed to make the payment of the remaining part of the Edoofa Enrollment fee. Hence, I thought of sharing a gentle reminder with you and trying to understand how your preparation has been so far? Have you been able to align your preparations in the right direction?
30/1/24, 4:15 PM - +263 71 692 1784: Thank you for the reminder I had forgotten
30/1/24, 4:18 PM - Dev Edoofa: No worries, may I know what is the update on the preparation of the fees?
30/1/24, 4:26 PM - +263 71 692 1784: Will give you the update when my father is back
30/1/24, 4:37 PM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. We will reconnect with each other a few days before your due date to take a follow up on this and understand your preparations better.
30/1/24, 4:37 PM - Dev Edoofa: In the meantime, Let us move forward with our discussion. To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is BCom and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2025. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
30/1/24, 4:43 PM - +263 71 692 1784: Yes it's correct
30/1/24, 4:44 PM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. Based on our experience of over 14 years and having assisted over 5000 students from different countries, we have realized that financial planning is the most important factor when a student plans for their higher education abroad.
30/1/24, 4:44 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am sure that you must be aware that 20-30% of students who are admitted into universities abroad are unable to fulfill their dream and come to India due to a lack of financial planning. The funds needed for booking flights, accommodation, and covering living expenses after arrival often become overwhelming, leading to the decision to defer their admission for a year. This, in turn, creates a gap in the child's education.
30/1/24, 4:44 PM - Dev Edoofa: To assist both students and parents in this regard, Edoofa Management has designed a Financial Secure Plan that aims to help you prepare for your higher educational finances without experiencing stress or last-minute rushes. I believe you must be wondering about the details of the same plan and how it helps the parents?
30/1/24, 4:45 PM - +263 71 692 1784: Yes
30/1/24, 4:46 PM - Dev Edoofa: Edoofa Secure Plan is important for parents who have children joining the university for tertiary education in the next one to two years for several reasons:
30/1/24, 4:46 PM - Dev Edoofa: 1. *Financial Preparedness:* The Edoofa Secure plan helps parents prepare financially for the costs after the Scholarship being offered so that they are not caught off guard.

2. *Reduced Financial Stress:* Having the Edoofa Secure Plan in place can significantly reduce the financial stress on you as parents when your child is about to enter university. Knowing that there is a dedicated fund for education expenses provides peace of mind.
30/1/24, 4:46 PM - Dev Edoofa: 3. *Avoiding Debt*: Without proper savings, some parents may resort to taking out loans or accumulating credit card debt to cover their child's education costs. This Educational savings plan helps avoid the burden of debt and high-interest payments.

4. *Compound Interest:* By starting to save early and consistently contributing to the savings plan, parents can take advantage of compound interest, which can significantly increase the amount available for education expenses.
30/1/24, 4:46 PM - Dev Edoofa: 5. *Flexibility and Control:* The Edoofa Secure savings plans allow parents to have greater control over their finances and how they allocate funds for their child's education. They can choose investment options that align with their risk tolerance and financial goals.

6. *Encouraging Responsibility*: Involving your child in the process of saving for their education teaches them financial responsibility and the value of higher education. It also motivates them to outperform in Academics.
30/1/24, 4:46 PM - Dev Edoofa: 7. *Adapting to Unexpected Changes*: Life is full of surprises, and circumstances can change especially when there are political reforms changing each day impacting the Local Currency. Having an Edoofa Secure Plan allows parents to adapt to unexpected changes in their financial situation while still prioritizing their child's education.

8. *Peace of Mind:* Overall, having the Edoofa Secure plan provides parents with peace of mind, knowing that they are actively planning for their child's future and increasing the likelihood of providing them with a solid education.
30/1/24, 4:46 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, when you go through all the above benefits, I am sure you can see that the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan is an important financial tool for parents/students who are supposed to enter the university soon. 

It helps ensure that the financial aspect of tertiary education is well-managed, reduces stress, and allows parents to provide the best opportunities for their children without resorting to debt or financial hardship. Isn't this something you and your family also wish to have?
30/1/24, 4:50 PM - +263 71 692 1784: Yes it is
30/1/24, 4:55 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through the above points, do you want me to help you understand how the Edoofa Secure Plan works?
30/1/24, 4:55 PM - +263 71 692 1784: Yes
30/1/24, 4:55 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, as you are aware, we are currently in January 2024, and we have a good 20 months to plan for your finances before you start your university education in 2025.
30/1/24, 4:55 PM - Dev Edoofa: During the counseling session, you were informed that at Edoofa, we guarantee a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship on the tuition fees. Hence, the cost of education, including food and accommodation after the scholarship, would be between $2000-$3000, and it could be even less. Not more than that.
30/1/24, 4:55 PM - Dev Edoofa: This means that if you can save $150 per month for the next 20 months, you will be able to save $3000. This amount is more than enough for the first year of university fees, including tuition fees (if any), food, and accommodation. I hope you agree with this?
30/1/24, 5:01 PM - +263 71 692 1784: Yeah that's great
30/1/24, 5:03 PM - Dev Edoofa: Right, this means that by the time you would be in India, you would have already saved the $3000 that will cover the first-year fee.
30/1/24, 5:03 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, in these next 20 months, I am sure you would also be engaged in the EWYL program, and if you secure a minimum of $1000 in 20 months, that means the fees for 1.5 years are already secured.
30/1/24, 5:03 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, for a 3-year course, if we follow the same approach for the remaining 1.5 years, the educational journey for the student and the financial journey for the parent will be easy and smooth. I believe you must be able to see this perspective?
30/1/24, 5:19 PM - +263 71 692 1784: Yes it's clear
30/1/24, 5:22 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. With that said, there is also another benefit, I am sure being in Zimbabwe you know how drastically the exchange rate fluctuates.
30/1/24, 5:22 PM - Dev Edoofa: If you are buying a dollar today, you might be spending 7000 bonds, but if you buy a dollar after a month, the rate would be different.
30/1/24, 5:22 PM - Dev Edoofa: Also, even if you choose to buy dollars every month and save at your home, it is not safe since there is news of robbery, and mugging every day.
30/1/24, 5:22 PM - Dev Edoofa: In that case, you will opt to save in the Bank, but again we know that savings in the Bank require a Nostro Account which means you have to pay the bank to keep your money safe, right?
