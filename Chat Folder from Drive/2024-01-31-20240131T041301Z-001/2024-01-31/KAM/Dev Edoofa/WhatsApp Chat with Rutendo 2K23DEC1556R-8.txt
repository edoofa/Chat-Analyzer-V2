I hope all of you are doing great. While I was wrapping up my day, I observed that we were not able to have a smooth discussion for the past couple of days, which has led to some delay in the admission process. We are aware of your immense trust in us and we surely care about your future. Considering that in mind, I wanted to schedule a specific session tomorrow at 8:30 am so that we can cover the process we are lagging behind,  and ensure that your admission process is on track. I am aware that Rutendo is now at school. Hence, I wanted to understand if you as parents/guardians will be available for our session at 8:30am. If not, I would like you to please let me know at what time between 8:30 am to 4 pm will you be available?

9/1/24, 10:15 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that!  First and foremost, allow me to extend my heartfelt congratulations to you and your family for making the wonderful decision to enroll in the Edoofa program.

Could you kindly provide an introduction of hers and also share details about your family, sponsor, or guardians who will play a role in shaping Rutendo's educational plans?
9/1/24, 12:38 PM - +263 77 386 0303: Rutendo Bongozozo a young lady aged   17 years currently doing A levels studies at Loreto High School
Rutendo is born in a family 2,

9/1/24, 3:29 PM - +263 77 386 0303: Hello
9/1/24, 8:02 PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Rutendo.

I hope all of you are having a wonderful day. Today I had a meeting with the academic board and I was discussing the current status of your application file and in the same discussion, the team higjlighted that we have been a bit off track for the discusisons we were suppsed to completed and hence I wanted to reach out to you and just reiteratre the agenda of the sessions/discusisons we have in place.
9/1/24, 8:02 PM - Dev Edoofa: The agenda for these sessions is to help you understand the process Rutendo will undertake for his university admission journey and what your family will be experiencing with the Edoofa Scholarship Program over the next one and a half years. However, since Rutendo is in school and you are occupied with work during the day, it seems that the same challenge in connectivity is going to persist for the next couple of months as well. <This message was edited>
9/1/24, 8:03 PM - Dev Edoofa: If you see, our goal is to help you prepare for your child's education abroad, that is something that is going to require a significant time. It requires months of planning. Hence, to do that perfectly and be prepared, as a parent, you would have to contribute an hour daily for at least 10 days so that we can be in sync and make the right decisions.
9/1/24, 8:03 PM - Dev Edoofa: We, at Edoofa, are determined to provide affordable higher education to hardworking students and assist them in launching their careers to greater heights. We will be able to help you only if we can connect timely and have healthy discussions.
9/1/24, 8:03 PM - Dev Edoofa: With that being said, what I can do right now to solve this constraint is give you the freedom to choose the time slot for our sessions over the next 10 days [till 20th January]. This way, we can align it with our availability as well and help you move forward and make progress in a streamlined manner. Could you please let me know at what time you would be available from Monday to Friday between 08:00 AM and 06:00 PM? This would help us factor in your inputs and find the right time for our sessions.
10/1/24, 8:31 AM - +263 77 386 0303: Good morning for today we can start but going forward her mother will tell yu  the time she can avail  her  self

I hope you are doing well. I have taken note of the timings that you have shared with us. Kindly provide me some time to reschedule the sessions and give you the confirmation accordingly. I hope you understand?
12/1/24, 2:34 PM - Dev Edoofa: Till then with great excitement and pride, I want to share that over the past few days, the Edoofa team has been immersed in an exciting event we had in store for our students. Edoofa hosted a conference - the Symposium of Leaders, Innovators, and Creators at Edoofa, also known as 'SLICE-CON.'

The conference was attended by all the Edoofians of 2023 and a few senior Edoofians from previous batches. It focused on the art of creation, innovation, and, most importantly, the mindset required to make an impact in one's career.
12/1/24, 2:35 PM - Dev Edoofa: During this Industrial Visit and the conference - SLICE CON, Corporate leaders, such as the CEOs and Co-founders from renowned companies like Rage Coffee, Sirona Hygiene, Jolin New York, and more, shared their insights and experience. These individuals are at the helm of multi-millionaire brands, leading large marketing teams. Their presence added immense value, providing students with the opportunity to engage in transformative conversations.
12/1/24, 2:35 PM - Dev Edoofa: We believe that interactions with such industry leaders can bring significant transformations to students' lives, enhancing their business acumen. Our Edoofians maximized this opportunity, having life-changing conversations with these influential figures. The main objective of the event was to emphasize the importance of thinking outside the box, encouraging students to believe in themselves and their dreams. Before we start our session today, I wanted to share a glimpse of the event, and I hope you are excited to attend similar events when you come to India.

29/1/24, 9:48 AM - Dev Edoofa: Good Afternoon @263773860303 and  @263712355969!

29/1/24, 12:15 PM - +263 71 235 5969: Yes
29/1/24, 12:34 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that! Moving forward in today's session, we will discuss a bit about your university admission journey. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts. I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them.

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
29/1/24, 12:36 PM - +263 71 235 5969: Yes we can proceed with the session
29/1/24, 12:43 PM - Dev Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/1/24, 12:44 PM - +263 71 235 5969: Oky u can explain
29/1/24, 12:45 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
29/1/24, 12:45 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
29/1/24, 12:48 PM - +263 71 235 5969: Yes can proceed
29/1/24, 12:50 PM - Dev Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps - 

*Step 3: Introduction to the Financial Secure Plan* - Parents with children embarking on their university journey within the next one to two years face important decision-making and rigorous financial planning. Edoofa recognizes the significance of this transition and hence has introduced the Edoofa Secure Plan - a unique and systematic strategy to empower parents in financial planning and preparing for their child's tertiary education well in advance.
29/1/24, 12:50 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Scholarship Offer Letter from the university would be issued next year in the month of August.

I hope you are following?
29/1/24, 12:53 PM - +263 71 235 5969: Noted
29/1/24, 12:56 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. The registration fee will be paid through the savings you have accumulated visa the Financial Secure Plan. After the registration fee is paid, for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
29/1/24, 12:56 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
29/1/24, 12:58 PM - +263 71 235 5969: Quite clear thank u
29/1/24, 12:59 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through all 6 steps, if we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
29/1/24, 1:00 PM - +263 71 235 5969: Oky let's proceed
29/1/24, 1:05 PM - Dev Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
29/1/24, 1:05 PM - Dev Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding. For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
29/1/24, 1:07 PM - +263 71 235 5969: Oky
29/1/24, 1:08 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students*

This is a video by the founders of EDOOFA, in which they share 2 important qualities of successful Edoofians- who've secured a maximum scholarship and earned scholarship credits.

29/1/24, 1:08 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s vision for you*

This is another video of the founders, where they share the vision of Edoofa at a core level. Founders also talk more about the most important character trait that distinguishes a successful student from the rest of the crowd.

29/1/24, 1:08 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

The third video is about Schools, Colleges, and Universities. I'm sure you're excited to learn more about the schools, colleges, and universities on the Edoofa Platform. Founders talk about their decade-long journey of discovering these schools and the experiences that students are having in these schools.

29/1/24, 1:08 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP*

The fourth video is about the Statement of Purpose (SOP). The most important step towards securing a good scholarship is to write the Statement of Purpose but to know why it is important, watching this video will clear your doubts and questions.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftsGGGBYMrs&feature=youtu.be
29/1/24, 1:10 PM - Dev Edoofa: I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection. I would recommend you to watch the videos now, so that we can reconnect after you have watched the videos and share your understanding of these, and we can move forward. May I know if you are clear with this?
29/1/24, 1:13 PM - +263 71 235 5969: Unfortunately I dont have internet connection only WhatsApp bundle
29/1/24, 1:14 PM - Dev Edoofa: Okay, let me share with you the downloaded videos here only, so as to ensure that you can watch the videos on Whatsapp only.

30/1/24, 3:30 PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Afternoon @263773860303 @263712355969 

I hope you are doing well. I was expecting a response from your end yesterday and hence I wanted to reach out to you once again and see if we are still connected. 

At the same time, I was going through your application file and as per the same, you are supposed to make the payment of your remaining part of the Edoofa Enrollment fee of $150 before 27 January 2024. 

In light of this, I wanted to reach out to you, share a gentle reminder, and try to understand if you have been able to make the payment of your fee by now so that we can update the academic board accordingly?
