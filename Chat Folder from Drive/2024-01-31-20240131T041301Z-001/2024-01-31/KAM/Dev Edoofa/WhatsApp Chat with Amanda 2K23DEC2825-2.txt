I completely understand that Amanda is in school and needs to attend the lessons, which I am extremely happy to hear about. Gaining knowledge should not be hindered.

22/1/24, 11:59 AM - Dev Edoofa: Moving forward in our today’s session, we will discuss a bit about Amanda's university admission journey. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts. I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them.

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
22/1/24, 12:01 PM - +263 77 385 0175: Yes please I am ready.
22/1/24, 12:02 PM - Dev Edoofa: <Media omitted>
22/1/24, 12:09 PM - +263 77 385 0175: I have gone through the 6 stages and what I need now is the explanations.
22/1/24, 12:09 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
22/1/24, 12:09 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
22/1/24, 12:21 PM - +263 77 385 0175: I have gone through the two and I hope more light will be given on step two.
22/1/24, 12:29 PM - Dev Edoofa: The Statement of Purpose is a form that is to be prepared by a student to send to the universities so that universities can recognize if he/she is worthy of a scholarship as well it helps them to get insights about the students and make the necessary decisions. We will help you prepare the same soon. Till then we can move forward. So shall we?
22/1/24, 12:30 PM - +263 77 385 0175: Thank you very much. I now understand and we can move forward.
22/1/24, 12:34 PM - Dev Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
22/1/24, 12:34 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
22/1/24, 12:39 PM - +263 77 385 0175: Yes I am following. You can proceed.
22/1/24, 12:40 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process, the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
22/1/24, 12:40 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
22/1/24, 12:42 PM - +263 77 385 0175: Yes they are clear.
22/1/24, 12:44 PM - Dev Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
22/1/24, 12:45 PM - +263 77 385 0175: Yes let us start. Thank you.
22/1/24, 12:47 PM - Dev Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding until you are ready, shall we start with our discussion with me individually? 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
22/1/24, 12:51 PM - +263 77 385 0175: Yes please.
22/1/24, 12:55 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students*

25/1/24, 2:16 PM - +263 77 385 0175: Good afternoon. I am submitting Amanda’s responses to the questions asked.
25/1/24, 2:16 PM - +263 77 385 0175: QUESTION 2

UI stands for “User Interface Design”. User Interface Design is a purely digital practice which considers the screens, buttons, toggles, icons and other visual elements that one interact with when using a website, app, or other electronic device. User Interface is responsible for the transference of a product’s development, research, content and layout into an attractive, guiding and responsive experience for users. The goal of User Interface Design is to visually guide the user through a product’s interface. It is all about creating an intuitive experience that does not require the user to think too much. 
UX means “User Experience Design”. User Experience refers to the entire interaction you have with a product, including how you feel about the interaction. User Experience applies to anything that can be experienced like website, a coffee machine or a visit to a supermarket. The user experience refers to the interaction between the user and a product or service looking at all the different elements that shape this experience. It is the job of User Experience and User Interface designers to make their clients digital products intuitive and accessible to target users. 

QUESTION 3

OSI stands for Open Systems Interconnection. The Open Systems Interconnection model is a conceptual framework that is used to describe how a network functions. It standardize the way computer systems send information to each other. 
It is a 7 layer architecture with each layer having specific functionality to perform. Layer 1 is the physical layer which transports data using electrical, mechanical or procedural interfaces. It sends computer bits from one device to another along the network. Later 2 is the data link or protocol layer and handles moving data into and out of a physical link in a network. It also permits the transmission of data to layer 3. Layer 3, The network layer moves data into and through other networks. Layer 4, The transport layer is responsible for transferring data across a network and provides error checking mechanisms and data flow controls. Layer 5 The session layer sets up, coordinates and terminates conventions between applications. Layer 6, The presentation layer translates or formats data for the semantics or syntax the application accepts. Layer 7, The application layer enables the user, human or software, to interact with the application or network whenever the user elects to read messages.
25/1/24, 2:17 PM - +263 77 385 0175: QUESTION 4

Programming is giving a set of instructions to a computer to execute. It is the mental process of thinking up instructions to give to a machine, like a computer. It refers to a technological process for telling a computer. Programming can be taken as a collaboration between humans and computers, in which humans create instructions for a computer to follow (code) in a language computers can understand.
Programming Language is a way for programmers (developers) to communicate with computers. Programming languages consist of a set of rules that allows string values to be converted into various ways of generating machine code or in visual programming languages graphical elements. The most commonly used languages are Python, Java and Vb.net. Python is mainly used  because it is simple, short and precise. Vb.net is used because it is understandable by both user and machine. Java is used because it had both the characteristics of Python becaus it is  precise and understandable .
25/1/24, 2:17 PM - +263 77 385 0175: QUESTION 5

A compiler is a computer program that reads statements in one programming language and translates them into another language that a computer can process. 
An Interpreter is a computer software that translates and then executes the indicated operations, that is, a program that executes each of a set of high level instructions before going to the next instruction. 
For differences, the first is the Primary Function. An interpreter typically translates lines of code or instructions one at a time as opposed to all at once as a compiler does. The second is the Capacity. Interpreters create new lines of source code each time they operate as compared to compilers. The Error of Response is the third. A compiler only offers error messages after reviewing the entire program it is trying to translate whilst an interpreter addresses errors one at a time.

26/1/24, 9:52 AM - Dev Edoofa: Good Afternoon Mr. and Mrs. Kaiboni and Amanda!
I hope you are doing well and are having a wonderful start to the day. I felt a bit under the weather yesterday, so I took a day off to focus on my health. Today, I am feeling better and completely ready to take our conversation forward. Thank you so much for sharing the responses to the document and filling out the SOP form. We will have our session at 3:00 PM. I hope that you are going to be on time?
26/1/24, 10:00 AM - +263 77 385 0175: I am fine here and I hope your health is better today. Let us meet at 3:00 PM please.
26/1/24, 10:03 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that!
26/1/24, 3:09 PM - +263 77 673 5858: Good afternoon
26/1/24, 3:11 PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Afernoon Mr. and Mrs. Kaiboni and Amanda. 
I hope you are doing well. May I know if you are ready for the session?
26/1/24, 3:11 PM - +263 77 673 5858: Yes we are
26/1/24, 3:12 PM - +263 77 385 0175: Good afternoon to you also. Yes we are ready.
26/1/24, 3:23 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that! We have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey. we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*.
26/1/24, 3:24 PM - Dev Edoofa: In the meantime. Let us move forward with our discussion. To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is Bachelors in Computer Application and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2025. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
26/1/24, 3:25 PM - +263 77 673 5858: Yes it is
26/1/24, 3:26 PM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. Based on our experience of over 14 years and having assisted over 5000 students from different countries, we have realized that financial planning is the most important factor when a student plans for his/her higher education abroad.
26/1/24, 3:26 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am sure that you must be aware that 20-30% of students who are admitted into universities abroad are unable to fulfill their dream and come to India due to a lack of financial planning. The funds needed for booking flights, accommodation, and covering living expenses after arrival often become overwhelming, leading to the decision to defer their admission for a year. This, in turn, creates a gap in the child's education.
26/1/24, 3:26 PM - Dev Edoofa: To assist both students and parents in this regard, Edoofa Management has designed a Financial Secure Plan that aims to help you prepare for your higher educational finances without experiencing stress or last-minute rushes. I believe you must be wondering about the details of the same plan and how it helps the parents?
26/1/24, 3:28 PM - +263 77 673 5858: Yea I am
26/1/24, 3:37 PM - Dev Edoofa: Edoofa Secure Plan is important for parents who have children joining the university for tertiary education in the next one to two years for several reasons:
26/1/24, 3:37 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Financial Preparedness:* The Edoofa Secure plan helps parents prepare financially for the costs after the Scholarship being offered so that they are not caught off guard.

*Reduced Financial Stress:* Having the Edoofa Secure Plan in place can significantly reduce the financial stress on you as parents when your child is about to enter university. Knowing that there is a dedicated fund for education expenses provides peace of mind.
26/1/24, 3:37 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Avoiding Debt*: Without proper savings, some parents may resort to taking out loans or accumulating credit card debt to cover their child's education costs. This Educational savings plan helps avoid the burden of debt and high-interest payments.

*Compound Interest:* By starting to save early and consistently contributing to the savings plan, parents can take advantage of compound interest, which can significantly increase the amount available for education expenses.
26/1/24, 3:37 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Flexibility and Control:* The Edoofa Secure savings plans allow parents to have greater control over their finances and how they allocate funds for their child's education. They can choose investment options that align with their risk tolerance and financial goals.

*Encouraging Responsibility*: Involving your child in the process of saving for their education teaches them financial responsibility and the value of higher education. It also motivates them to outperform in Academics.
26/1/24, 3:37 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Adapting to Unexpected Changes*: Life is full of surprises, and circumstances can change especially when there are political reforms changing each day impacting the Local Currency. Having an Edoofa Secure Plan allows parents to adapt to unexpected changes in their financial situation while still prioritizing their child's education.

*Peace of Mind:* Overall, having the Edoofa Secure plan provides parents with peace of mind, knowing that they are actively planning for their child's future and increasing the likelihood of providing them with a solid education.
26/1/24, 3:37 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, when you go through all the above benefits, I am sure you can see that the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan is an important financial tool for parents/students who are supposed to enter the university soon. 

It helps ensure that the financial aspect of tertiary education is well-managed, reduces stress, and allows parents to provide the best opportunities for their children without resorting to debt or financial hardship. Isn't this something you and your family also wish to have?
26/1/24, 3:41 PM - +263 77 673 5858: Yes it is
26/1/24, 3:48 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through the above points, do you want me to help you understand how the Edoofa Secure Plan works?
26/1/24, 3:49 PM - +263 77 385 0175: Yes please.
26/1/24, 3:58 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, as you are aware, we are currently in January 2024, and we have a good 20 months to plan for your finances before you start your university education in 2025.
26/1/24, 3:58 PM - Dev Edoofa: During the counseling session, you were informed that at Edoofa, we guarantee a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship on the tuition fees. Hence, the cost of education, including food and accommodation after the scholarship, would be between $2000-$3000, and it could be even less. Not more than that.
26/1/24, 3:58 PM - Dev Edoofa: This means that if you can save $150 per month for the next 20 months, you will be able to save $3000. This amount is more than enough for the first year of university fees, including tuition fees (if any), food, and accommodation. I hope you agree with this?
26/1/24, 4:12 PM - +263 77 673 5858: Yes we do
26/1/24, 4:14 PM - Dev Edoofa: Right, this means that by the time you would be in India, you would have already saved the $3000 that will cover the first-year fee.
26/1/24, 4:14 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, in these next 20 months, I am sure you would also be engaged in the EWYL program, and if you secure a minimum of $1000 in 20 months, that means the fees for 1.5 years are already secured.
26/1/24, 4:14 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, for a 3-year course, if we follow the same approach for the remaining 1.5 years, the educational journey for the student and the financial journey for the parent will be easy and smooth. I believe you must be able to see this perspective?
26/1/24, 4:15 PM - +263 77 673 5858: Yes I am
26/1/24, 4:19 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. With that said, there is also another benefit, I am sure being in Zimbabwe you know how drastically the exchange rate fluctuates.
26/1/24, 4:19 PM - Dev Edoofa: If you are buying a dollar today, you might be spending 7000 bonds, but if you buy a dollar after a month, the rate would be different.
26/1/24, 4:19 PM - Dev Edoofa: Also, even if you choose to buy dollars every month and save at your home, it is not safe since there is news of robbery, and mugging every day.
26/1/24, 4:19 PM - Dev Edoofa: In that case, you will opt to save in the Bank, but again we know that savings in the Bank require a Nostro Account which means you have to pay the bank to keep your money safe, right?
26/1/24, 4:22 PM - +263 77 673 5858: Yes
26/1/24, 4:32 PM - Dev Edoofa: That is great to hear, considering these constraints, Edoofa Management has decided to help the parents and students prepare for the journey way ahead of time by helping them save money with Edoofa without any additional charges but rather saving additional money as well. Do you want me to explain how this has been achieved?
26/1/24, 4:32 PM - +263 77 673 5858: Yes
26/1/24, 4:43 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Program Fee (Enrollment Fee) that you were asked to pay is $350.
26/1/24, 4:44 PM - Dev Edoofa: Under the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan, a parent has to deposit a small amount of money which is $150 every month for the next 10 months. 

That means, in 10 months, the money saved will be $1500.
26/1/24, 4:44 PM - Dev Edoofa: Imagine you paying $15 every month to the Bank of Zimbabwe to keep your money safe, and here Edoofa is paying you $15 every month to keep your money safe. Now, you must be wondering, why only for 10 months and not for 20 months, right?
26/1/24, 4:47 PM - +263 77 673 5858: Yes you are
26/1/24, 4:51 PM - Dev Edoofa: If you see the bigger picture, you will realize that the reason is quite simple. Upon the completion of the 10 installments, the Edoofa Admissions team will initiate the Child’s Admission Process by applying early to the universities to secure their scholarship and their university seat.
26/1/24, 4:51 PM - Dev Edoofa: Reserving seats earlier increases the chances of obtaining a maximum scholarship. A higher scholarship means lower fees, and by securing the seat, you will be entitled to pay the fees as per the old fee structure of the university, not the new one implemented in January 2025. Furthermore, when applying to the universities, you will receive an offer letter or a letter of intent detailing the fees, scholarship, and registration fees.
26/1/24, 4:51 PM - Dev Edoofa: As explained during the enrollment process, the registration fee is a portion of your first-year university fee, paid to reserve the seat. It ranges from $500-$1000 and is not an additional fee. 

From the $1500 you saved with Edoofa, the registration fee will be paid to the university, securing the seat. For instance, if the registration fee is $1000, Edoofa will pay $1000 from the $1500 saved in 10 months. The updated balance with Edoofa will be $500, which will be paid to the university upon your arrival in India.
26/1/24, 4:51 PM - Dev Edoofa: This eases the financial burden on the parent, as there is no immediate payment required upon the student's arrival. The $500 saved will cover the remaining fees for the semester/year, as specified in the offer letter from the university. What are your thoughts on this?
26/1/24, 4:55 PM - +263 77 673 5858: I understand the part on saving money but I'm still trying to understand why because , correct me if I'm wrong but Edoofa suppose to help me with most of the expenses?
26/1/24, 4:55 PM - +263 77 673 5858: And I'm suppose to contribute through the EWYL Program?
26/1/24, 5:07 PM - Dev Edoofa: Yes, Amanda, that is absolutely correct. Normally, in India, the cost of education ranges from $6000-$8000. Edoofa with it's experience of 15 years in the field of education has able to cut the expenses to $2000-$3000 with the help of scholarships for the students. After, that we are also providing with students to self finance their education even after receiving scholarships. But, still, students face some or the other constraints in properly preparing for the finances, and eventually miss out on grabbing this opportunity of studying here. To eradicate this, we have carefully designed this plan to make sure that you are able to prepare properly for the finances and come to India to fulfill your dreams. I hope you are able to understand what I am trying to convey?
26/1/24, 5:10 PM - +263 77 673 5858: Yes I do but let's say I happen to attain a full scholarship from Edoofa will all the expanses be covered or is there a certain amount I have to pay including the registration fee ? Even if we still do the whole saving of money?
26/1/24, 5:39 PM - Dev Edoofa: I completely understand your concern, but you need to understand that you will get the scholarship on the tuition fees but not all the expenses, that are going to be such as registration fees, accommodation, food expenses, and other basic university expenses, that you have to bear. So to help the students prepare their finances accordingly, this plan is designed so that don't face such kind of constraints with their finances. I hope you understand?
26/1/24, 5:40 PM - +263 77 673 5858: Yes I do
26/1/24, 5:40 PM - +263 77 673 5858: Thank you
26/1/24, 5:41 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that! Shall we move forward?
26/1/24, 5:42 PM - +263 77 385 0175: Yes
26/1/24, 5:43 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to see that we are together so far. With this plan for the next 10 months, I am sure you must be wondering what will happen in the next 10 months, considering you have already secured your scholarship seat with the university due to your hard work in the first 10 months. Is my understanding correct?
26/1/24, 5:44 PM - +263 77 673 5858: Yes
26/1/24, 5:46 PM - Dev Edoofa: Let me help you with that as well. In the 11th month, you will be guided to open an FBC Mastercard bank account in Zimbabwe with a deposit of $150. The reason for this is that when you apply for your student Visa, the Embassy asks for a Bank Statement, and this account will serve that purpose.
26/1/24, 5:46 PM - Dev Edoofa: We understand it might be expensive if you deposit another $1500 for the remaining 10 months in FB  Bank Zimbabwe, so to avoid the same challenges, we have designed the plan accordingly. You will only be depositing for the 11th, 12th, 13th, and 14th month, which is 4 months.
26/1/24, 5:46 PM - Dev Edoofa: Once the 4 months are completed, our Department of Student Welfare (DSW) team will assist you with your visa process. The bank statement will act as one of the required documents, and once you receive the visa, you can withdraw the amount from FBC and book the flight ticket. This will help you utilize the money as well. How does it sound?
26/1/24, 5:50 PM - +44 7947 178735: What’s the merit of having an FBC Account in Zimbabwe
26/1/24, 5:53 PM - Dev Edoofa: It is just an example through which we are helping you understand. You can use any of the bank which allows bank transfers. I hope I was able to clear your query?
26/1/24, 5:58 PM - +44 7947 178735: Very clear. Can a student save any amount with Edoofa?
26/1/24, 6:01 PM - Dev Edoofa: The students need to save $1500 starting from now till October, to ensure that they can save sufficient amount for the university expenses and are able to prepare their finances accordingly.
26/1/24, 6:08 PM - +263 77 385 0175: Thank you very much for the information. I do understand now what is needed in the future and when.
29/1/24, 3:36 PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Afternoon Mr. and Mrs. Kaiboni!
I hope you are doing well and had a great weekend. May I please ask you to confirm what is Amanda's year of admission intake?
29/1/24, 3:40 PM - +263 77 385 0175: Good afternoon to you too. We are well and fine. How are you also. Amanda’s year of admission is intake is 2025. Thank you.
29/1/24, 3:42 PM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. I have taken note of it as well.
29/1/24, 3:43 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, regarding the discussion we had the other day about the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan, I wanted to follow up on our last conversation. Have you, as a family, been able to discuss it? If so, I would like to understand how the discussion went. What were their thoughts about it? Did they have any specific queries or concerns that you would like us to address?
29/1/24, 3:58 PM - +263 77 385 0175: Yes we discussed it at length. The aspect of depositing for the 11th, 12th, 13th, and 14th month which is 4 months is not a problem. However, on the aspect of 1500 we will be able to raise it by the due date because our finances are not consistent. They do come after about two months. I can definitely confirm that by the due date the money will be there.
29/1/24, 4:27 PM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know about your concern and I completely understand it as well. But I want you to understand that parents need to manage their finances accordingly so that in the end at the time of admissions, the students do not face any roadblock in their journey of tertiary education. To help them face this problem, Edoofa has designed this plan, to make sure that students can come to India after enrolling into the scholarship program. Now, I understand that you have stable flow of every two months, so we can also propose you to pay $300 for every two months to ensure that you are able to save $1500 at the end of 10th month. I hope you understand what I am trying to convey?
29/1/24, 4:49 PM - +263 77 385 0175: I get your suggestion, however, since Amanda is going next year I was proposing that I pay 300 every 3 months. I will be more comfortable with it.
29/1/24, 4:55 PM - Dev Edoofa: I want you to understand that the admissions for 2025 are going to start in August 2024 and at that time you will have to pay for the registration fees as well as start preparing for the first-year fees as well, so, there will be no point in the Edoofa Secure Plan, if you are not able to save for it. I hope you understand?
29/1/24, 5:06 PM - +263 77 385 0175: I am very much interested in this EDOOFA Secure Plan. I had the misconception that all will be done next year. So this 150 per month when does it start and when will it end.
29/1/24, 5:12 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you are interested in this plan. The plan starts from February and continues till November, i.e. 10th month. I hope you are clear now?
29/1/24, 5:29 PM - +263 77 385 0175: I like the idea and I am going for it. Can I have some details on how to do it.
29/1/24, 5:37 PM - Dev Edoofa: Surely, @263773850175! Further, we will be deciding on the fixed date of every month on which you will be paying the amount and after that, an agreement will be sent to you regarding this plan. Post the agreement, we will help you with the different modes of payments through which you can make payments.
29/1/24, 5:47 PM - +263 77 385 0175: Noted thank you. We will be waiting to hear from you.
29/1/24, 5:49 PM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know, @263773850175. For the current round of students, there are only 27 seats available for the students who can benefit from the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan. 

Since Amanda has been one of the most dedicated students, and I see she has great aspirations, I wanted her to be a part of the same set of students and start with her future planning the right way.
29/1/24, 5:50 PM - Dev Edoofa: Also, as this plan commences from the month of February, for the efficient implementation of this plan, we need to decide on a fixed date on which you will deposit $150 every month. This will provide you with the flexibility to align your finances accordingly.
29/1/24, 5:50 PM - Dev Edoofa: Our complete focus is on providing students and parents with the best ways to avail themselves of these opportunities. We understand that every parent may not be able to make the payment on our specified date. Therefore, considering this situation, we allow them to decide the payment date according to their comfort. In light of the same, may I know the fixed date every month on which you will deposit $150?
29/1/24, 6:10 PM - +263 77 385 0175: Let us have 26 of every month as the fixed date.
30/1/24, 10:03 AM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for sharing these details, your commitment to securing a seat in this exclusive program is appreciated.
