22/1/24, 12:14 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
22/1/24, 12:14 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
22/1/24, 12:16 PM - +263 77 642 4175: Yes they are
22/1/24, 12:19 PM - Dev Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
22/1/24, 12:19 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
22/1/24, 12:22 PM - +263 77 642 4175: Yes l am
22/1/24, 12:29 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process, the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
22/1/24, 12:29 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
22/1/24, 12:36 PM - +263 77 642 4175: They are clear my question is on Admission fee of 500 to 1000 maybe if you can clarify on the two figures
22/1/24, 12:38 PM - Dev Edoofa: Yes, @263776424175! May I please ask you to please let us know what clarity you need on these two figures? It will help us to align you better accordingly.
22/1/24, 12:47 PM - +263 77 642 4175: Maybe let me put it this way , what conditions will make the figure to be 500 or to be 1000  does it depends with the University the student would have been enrolled
 or
22/1/24, 1:03 PM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for making yourself clear, @263776424175! The registration fee totally depends on the university from which you have received the offer letter. I hope you are clear now?
22/1/24, 1:05 PM - +263 77 642 4175: It's now clear thank you
22/1/24, 1:06 PM - Dev Edoofa: You are most welcome! If we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
22/1/24, 1:06 PM - +263 77 642 4175: I,m available
22/1/24, 1:06 PM - Dev Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
22/1/24, 1:06 PM - Dev Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding until you are ready, shall we start with our discussion with me individually? 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
22/1/24, 1:09 PM - +263 77 642 4175: Yes l,m ready
22/1/24, 1:10 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students*

24/1/24, 1:40 PM - +263 77 642 4175: From the 4 videos l watched l understood that Edoofa has invested a lot of time identifying good schools, colleges and Universities for students becoz there are some colleges and universities which are after money and neglect the welfare and education of the enrolled students
_Edoofa also helps increase student,s capacity for success thus making them more responsible and independent
_It makes students employable
_ students should also follow Edoofa instructions and be teachable and open minded
_ There's is also the statement of purpose form which is an important document of which students should be prompt in taking and diligent in filling the form
#That,s what l understood from the 4 videos 
_
24/1/24, 1:51 PM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your detailed understanding of the videos that were shared with you. I believe that you were able to feel the essence of the videos and able to grasp the information that was shared with you.
24/1/24, 1:52 PM - +263 77 642 4175: Definitely
24/1/24, 2:03 PM - Dev Edoofa: Great!  Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
24/1/24, 2:04 PM - +263 77 642 4175: Yes we are
24/1/24, 2:13 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move Elexise's application ahead and help Elexise write a proper statement of purpose so that she can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to a Job. So, for the team to work on Elexise's application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, we would require Elexise's availability for approximately 30 minutes. If she is unavailable, she can provide you with her input, and you can proceed with the statement of purpose on her behalf. <This message was edited>
24/1/24, 2:21 PM - +263 77 642 4175: Let me ask for her input so that we proceed
24/1/24, 2:22 PM - Dev Edoofa: No worries, @263776424175! You will be provided to do the tasks. The following are the tasks that need to be completed:
24/1/24, 2:23 PM - Dev Edoofa: 1. I am sure you have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in Elexise's admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier.

24/1/24, 8:23 PM - +263 78 441 4013: 2) Entrepreneurship is defined as the risk which is taken by a person in injecting or investing his or her Capital into a business venture . There is a relationship between entrepreneurship and economic development, Entrepreneurship is mainly supported by any government in the world for it's contribution to the gross domestic product of any ec
onomy due to taxation.

Entrepreneurship also leads to employement creation , that is if an entrepreneur is able to employ 5 to 20 people this lessens the government's burden on cushioning the poor members of the society.
Employment creation also helps in eliminating the gap between the rich and the poor which is shown on the Lorenz curve.

Entrepreneurship also helps improve the balance of payments for any country. Most entrepreneurs export goods and services to other countries by so doing there is inflow of foreign currency in a country thereby reducing acute shortages of foreign currency.

Through ploughing back into the community entrepreneurs often develop roads and can even offer merit goods and services such as clinics and schools. This lessens the government's burden on providing for these merit goods and funds can be diverted to economic development.
24/1/24, 8:25 PM - +263 78 441 4013: As for question 3 can you please elaborate it for me l am not used to abbreviations
24/1/24, 8:40 PM - +263 78 441 4013: 4) Accounting Standards can be defined as rules of bookkeeping that are put in place to ensure that companies or firms are in compliance with the true and fair view concept 


Accounting Standards helps to ensure that financial statements globally are prepared in a uniform manner and help also to reduce the subjective element in the disclosure of information.

They also help in avoiding window dressing mostly practiced by many companies globally and makes sure that financial statements are prepared faithfully presenting all the facts free from bias and material error.

Companies are also helped to adapt to certain bases and principles so that they can easily compare accounting information from one Accounting period to the next .


By using accounting standards accounting information users will be left with a clear framework of the activities of a firm and will not be left in suspense.

Firms are also guided on what they are expected to do to tackle certain challenges they incur and for them also to adapt to the ever-changing economic environment.
24/1/24, 8:58 PM - +263 78 441 4013: 5) Accounting is the recording of transactions in the books of accounts whilst auditing is the inspection of accounting information to assess whether it is in line with accounting standards or not .

Accounting is done by an internal employee or accountant of a firm whilst auditing is done by either an accountant or not who is independent.

Accounting involves preparation of financial statements In the most understandable way whilst auditing involves inspection of already prepared statements.

Accounting involves presentation of information that is written down whilst auditing allows the auditor to give his or her point of view .


Accounting is preparation of financial statements for future use whilst auditing aims to bring about transparency to the shareholders and stakeholders of a firm

25/1/24, 7:41 PM - +263 78 441 4013: 3) GAAP refers to accounting standards and policies that are recognized globally.


According to my understanding,it is mandatory for every company to comply with the true and fair view concept .

Company auditors should make sure that all financial statements are prepared in accordance with the standards.

It covers many areas which include but not limited to IAS 1 , 2,7,8,10,16,,18,23,33,36,37and38

It also provides accounting concepts such as the  prudence concept which ensure that profits are not overstated.The going concern concept which makes sure that financial statements are prepared in a way that shows the business intends to continue operating in the future e.t.c.

It also covers contents of the auditor and director's reports . According to the GAAP accounting statements should have the four characteristics namely relevance, reliability, understandability and comparability so that they can be used by anyone around the globe.

26/1/24, 8:51 AM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you so much for your kind words
26/1/24, 9:02 AM - +263 77 642 4175: You are welcome Sir
26/1/24, 3:04 PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Afetrnoon @263776424175 !
I hope you are doing well. May I know if you are ready to take forward our conversation?
26/1/24, 3:08 PM - +263 77 642 4175: Yes l,m ready l hope you are feeling better now
26/1/24, 3:12 PM - Dev Edoofa: Yes, I am doing good. Thanks for your wishes.
26/1/24, 3:12 PM - Dev Edoofa: With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey. we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*.
26/1/24, 3:13 PM - +263 77 642 4175: Noted
26/1/24, 3:14 PM - Dev Edoofa: In the meantime. Let us move forward with our discussion. To confirm our records: the course Elexise has selected for her higher education is BA LLB and it's my understanding that she is planning to arrive in India in August 2025. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
26/1/24, 3:17 PM - +263 77 642 4175: Bachelor of Commerce Degree l don't know if it's the same with BA LLB
26/1/24, 3:20 PM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for noticing @263776424175. I have taken note of this mistake. It is supposed to be Bcom. only.
26/1/24, 3:20 PM - Dev Edoofa: I hope you understand?
26/1/24, 3:23 PM - +263 77 642 4175: Initially she applied for B.Com and after B.Com she will later advance to ACCA
26/1/24, 3:25 PM - +263 77 642 4175: So l don't know if those initials are referring to that
26/1/24, 3:25 PM - Dev Edoofa: This message was deleted
26/1/24, 3:25 PM - Dev Edoofa: yes it is!
26/1/24, 3:26 PM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. Based on our experience of over 14 years and having assisted over 5000 students from different countries, we have realized that financial planning is the most important factor when a student plans for his/her higher education abroad.
26/1/24, 3:26 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am sure that you must be aware that 20-30% of students who are admitted into universities abroad are unable to fulfill their dream and come to India due to a lack of financial planning. The funds needed for booking flights, accommodation, and covering living expenses after arrival often become overwhelming, leading to the decision to defer their admission for a year. This, in turn, creates a gap in the child's education.
26/1/24, 3:26 PM - Dev Edoofa: To assist both students and parents in this regard, Edoofa Management has designed a Financial Secure Plan that aims to help you prepare for your higher educational finances without experiencing stress or last-minute rushes. I believe you must be wondering about the details of the same plan and how it helps the parents?
26/1/24, 3:29 PM - +263 77 642 4175: Yes l am
26/1/24, 3:39 PM - Dev Edoofa: Edoofa Secure Plan is important for parents who have children joining the university for tertiary education in the next one to two years for several reasons:
26/1/24, 3:40 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Financial Preparedness:* The Edoofa Secure plan helps parents prepare financially for the costs after the Scholarship being offered so that they are not caught off guard.

*Reduced Financial Stress:* Having the Edoofa Secure Plan in place can significantly reduce the financial stress on you as parents when your child is about to enter university. Knowing that there is a dedicated fund for education expenses provides peace of mind.
26/1/24, 3:40 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Avoiding Debt*: Without proper savings, some parents may resort to taking out loans or accumulating credit card debt to cover their child's education costs. This Educational savings plan helps avoid the burden of debt and high-interest payments.

*Compound Interest:* By starting to save early and consistently contributing to the savings plan, parents can take advantage of compound interest, which can significantly increase the amount available for education expenses.
26/1/24, 3:40 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Flexibility and Control:* The Edoofa Secure savings plans allow parents to have greater control over their finances and how they allocate funds for their child's education. They can choose investment options that align with their risk tolerance and financial goals.

*Encouraging Responsibility*: Involving your child in the process of saving for their education teaches them financial responsibility and the value of higher education. It also motivates them to outperform in Academics.
26/1/24, 3:40 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Adapting to Unexpected Changes*: Life is full of surprises, and circumstances can change especially when there are political reforms changing each day impacting the Local Currency. Having an Edoofa Secure Plan allows parents to adapt to unexpected changes in their financial situation while still prioritizing their child's education.

*Peace of Mind:* Overall, having the Edoofa Secure plan provides parents with peace of mind, knowing that they are actively planning for their child's future and increasing the likelihood of providing them with a solid education.
26/1/24, 3:40 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, when you go through all the above benefits, I am sure you can see that the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan is an important financial tool for parents/students who are supposed to enter the university soon. 

It helps ensure that the financial aspect of tertiary education is well-managed, reduces stress, and allows parents to provide the best opportunities for their children without resorting to debt or financial hardship. Isn't this something you and your family also wish to have?
26/1/24, 3:43 PM - +263 77 642 4175: We wish to have that too
26/1/24, 3:48 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through the above points, do you want me to help you understand how the Edoofa Secure Plan works?
26/1/24, 3:50 PM - +263 77 642 4175: Yes l do
26/1/24, 3:58 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, as you are aware, we are currently in January 2024, and we have a good 20 months to plan for your finances before you start your university education in 2025.
26/1/24, 3:58 PM - Dev Edoofa: During the counseling session, you were informed that at Edoofa, we guarantee a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship on the tuition fees. Hence, the cost of education, including food and accommodation after the scholarship, would be between $2000-$3000, and it could be even less. Not more than that.
26/1/24, 3:58 PM - Dev Edoofa: This means that if you can save $150 per month for the next 20 months, you will be able to save $3000. This amount is more than enough for the first year of university fees, including tuition fees (if any), food, and accommodation. I hope you agree with this?
26/1/24, 4:01 PM - +263 77 642 4175: Yes l do
26/1/24, 4:05 PM - Dev Edoofa: Right, this means that by the time you would be in India, you would have already saved the $3000 that will cover the first-year fee.
26/1/24, 4:05 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, in these next 20 months, I am sure you would also be engaged in the EWYL program, and if you secure a minimum of $1000 in 20 months, that means the fees for 1.5 years are already secured.
26/1/24, 4:06 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, for a 3-year course, if we follow the same approach for the remaining 1.5 years, the educational journey for the student and the financial journey for the parent will be easy and smooth. I believe you must be able to see this perspective?
26/1/24, 4:09 PM - +263 77 642 4175: Yes l,m seeing that
26/1/24, 4:13 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. With that said, there is also another benefit, I am sure being in Zimbabwe you know how drastically the exchange rate fluctuates.
26/1/24, 4:13 PM - Dev Edoofa: If you are buying a dollar today, you might be spending 7000 bonds, but if you buy a dollar after a month, the rate would be different.
26/1/24, 4:13 PM - Dev Edoofa: Also, even if you choose to buy dollars every month and save at your home, it is not safe since there is news of robbery, and mugging every day.
26/1/24, 4:13 PM - Dev Edoofa: In that case, you will opt to save in the Bank, but again we know that savings in the Bank require a Nostro Account which means you have to pay the bank to keep your money safe, right?
26/1/24, 4:34 PM - +263 77 642 4175: Yes you are right
26/1/24, 4:45 PM - Dev Edoofa: That is great to hear, considering these constraints, Edoofa Management has decided to help the parents and students prepare for the journey way ahead of time by helping them save money with Edoofa without any additional charges but rather saving additional money as well. Do you want me to explain how this has been achieved?
26/1/24, 4:52 PM - +263 77 642 4175: Yes
26/1/24, 4:56 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Program Fee (Enrollment Fee) that you were asked to pay is $350.
26/1/24, 4:56 PM - Dev Edoofa: Under the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan, a parent has to deposit a small amount of money which is $150 every month for the next 10 months. 

That means, in 10 months, the money saved will be $1500.
26/1/24, 4:56 PM - Dev Edoofa: Imagine you paying $15 every month to the Bank of Zimbabwe to keep your money safe, and here Edoofa is paying you $15 every month to keep your money safe. Now, you must be wondering, why only for 10 months and not for 20 months, right?
26/1/24, 4:59 PM - +263 77 642 4175: Yes
26/1/24, 5:11 PM - Dev Edoofa: If you see the bigger picture, you will realize that the reason is quite simple. Upon the completion of the 10 installments, the Edoofa Admissions team will initiate the Child’s Admission Process by applying early to the universities to secure their scholarship and their university seat.
26/1/24, 5:11 PM - Dev Edoofa: Reserving seats earlier increases the chances of obtaining a maximum scholarship. A higher scholarship means lower fees, and by securing the seat, you will be entitled to pay the fees as per the old fee structure of the university, not the new one implemented in January 2025. Furthermore, when applying to the universities, you will receive an offer letter or a letter of intent detailing the fees, scholarship, and registration fees.
26/1/24, 5:11 PM - Dev Edoofa: As explained during the enrollment process, the registration fee is a portion of your first-year university fee, paid to reserve the seat. It ranges from $500-$1000 and is not an additional fee. 

From the $1500 you saved with Edoofa, the registration fee will be paid to the university, securing the seat. For instance, if the registration fee is $1000, Edoofa will pay $1000 from the $1500 saved in 10 months. The updated balance with Edoofa will be $500, which will be paid to the university upon your arrival in India.
26/1/24, 5:11 PM - Dev Edoofa: This eases the financial burden on the parent, as there is no immediate payment required upon the student's arrival. The $500 saved will cover the remaining fees for the semester/year, as specified in the offer letter from the university. What are your thoughts on this?
26/1/24, 5:17 PM - +263 77 642 4175: It's a good idea
26/1/24, 5:20 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to see that we are together so far. With this plan for the next 10 months, I am sure you must be wondering what will happen in the next 10 months, considering you have already secured your scholarship seat with the university due to your hard work in the first 10 months. Is my understanding correct?
26/1/24, 5:23 PM - +263 77 642 4175: Yes
26/1/24, 5:23 PM - Dev Edoofa: Let me help you with that as well. In the 11th month, you will be guided to open an FBC Mastercard bank account in Zimbabwe with a deposit of $150. The reason for this is that when you apply for your student Visa, the Embassy asks for a Bank Statement, and this account will serve that purpose.
26/1/24, 5:23 PM - Dev Edoofa: We understand it might be expensive if you deposit another $1500 for the remaining 10 months in FB  Bank Zimbabwe, so to avoid the same challenges, we have designed the plan accordingly. You will only be depositing for the 11th, 12th, 13th, and 14th month, which is 4 months.
26/1/24, 5:24 PM - Dev Edoofa: Once the 4 months are completed, our Department of Student Welfare (DSW) team will assist you with your visa process. The bank statement will act as one of the required documents, and once you receive the visa, you can withdraw the amount from FBC and book the flight ticket. This will help you utilize the money as well.
26/1/24, 5:24 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, from the 16th Month till the 20th month, considering it is a 6-month window, you can again continue depositing the money ($150) with Edoofa which can be used in the fee as and when required or you can decide to save this $900 of these 6 months with you as well. This is something which you are free to choose. I hope you have understood the financial secure plan now?
26/1/24, 5:30 PM - +263 77 642 4175: I have understood but my question now is if the money l would have saved is the one which is going to be used to secure a seat at the University where does the scholarship come in now becoz at first l thought the 2000_3000 will be paid when the student would have arrived in lndia before commencing lessons maybe l,m lost somewhere
26/1/24, 5:39 PM - Dev Edoofa: I completely understand your concern, but you need to understand that you will get the scholarship on the tuition fees but not all the expenses, that are going to be such as registration fee, accommodation, food expenses, and other basic university expenses, that you have to bear. So to help the students prepare their finances accordingly, this plan is designed so that don't face such kind of constraints with their finances. I hope you understand?
26/1/24, 5:46 PM - +263 77 642 4175: I do
26/1/24, 5:47 PM - Dev Edoofa: That's great. Now that you have all the information, I want you to take some time and discuss the financial security plan with your family members. Help them understand its importance and details. Once you're done, we can reconnect, have a discussion, and address any queries you may have. After resolving your concerns, I'll guide you through starting your financial security plan.
26/1/24, 5:54 PM - +263 77 642 4175: Noted
26/1/24, 5:56 PM - Dev Edoofa: Could you let me know when you think you'll have the discussion with your family? This way, we can schedule our next session accordingly.
26/1/24, 5:58 PM - +263 77 642 4175: By Monday becoz right now we are entering the Sabbath till tomorrow sunset so we will have our discussion on Sunday by Monday we will be done
26/1/24, 6:02 PM - Dev Edoofa: That's perfectly fine. In that case, we will conclude today's conversation, and I will connect with you on Monday to resume our discussion. In the meantime, I hope you'll have a detailed discussion with your family and jot down any questions or thoughts you have regarding the Financial Secure plan.

Wishing you a good day ahead, and please extend our regards to your family.
26/1/24, 7:19 PM - +263 77 642 4175: Thank you
26/1/24, 8:26 PM - Dev Edoofa: You are most welcome!
27/1/24, 11:53 AM - Dev Edoofa: Good Afternoon @263776424175!

Please, how are you doing today? With regards to our discussion yesterday, I wanted to reach out and enquire if you are available for us to have a brief conversation?
27/1/24, 1:37 PM - +263 77 642 4175: Right now we are attending church service till 5pm l don't know if it's possible to have it after 5 or we can have it tomorrow
29/1/24, 10:44 AM - Dev Edoofa: Good Morning @263776424175!
I hope you are doing well and had a great weekend. May I know if you were able to discuss the Edoofa Secure Plan in detail wit h your family and jot down any queries that may have raised?
29/1/24, 12:22 PM - +263 77 642 4175: I,m doing well how are you?Yes we managed to discuss about it
29/1/24, 12:33 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am doing absolutely fine. Thanks for asking. I am glad to hear that you were able to discuss it. May I know if you have any queries regarding the plan?
29/1/24, 12:59 PM - +263 77 642 4175: We don't have queries as such but we did our calculations looking at the amount of money we get per month and our expenditure and the money which we will be suppose to be paying per month  and considering the current situation in the country we cannot afford that
29/1/24, 1:38 PM - Dev Edoofa: I completely understand your concern and where you are coming from, however, I need you to understand that this plan helps you prepare for the finances of higher education, and ensures that Elexise does not face any kind of roadblock during her admission as well as when she is in college here in India. Now, if you wish to not opt for the Edoofa Secure Plan now and at the time of admissions, due to some or other reason, you are not able to raise the registration fees. In this scenario, Elexise will not be able to reserve her seat in the universities, and her dream of becoming and your dream to see her become a successful individual in her life. I believe that you do not want to take this kind of risk. I hope you understand what I am trying to convey?
29/1/24, 2:01 PM - +263 77 642 4175: Yes l do
29/1/24, 2:50 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that! Now, if you will not be able to afford this, then may I know if you have any alternative plan to make sure that you do not face any financial constraints in Elexise's admission journey?
29/1/24, 3:36 PM - +263 77 642 4175: From what we discussed we later realized that we might face challenges in the near future of failing to pay the fees taking into consideration that life is unpredictable so myself being the bread winner in the event that maybe l,m no longer going to work or maybe the worst i.e death and my daughter would have been admitted at a university in lndia it means she will not continue with her education and the worse part of it she will be abroad then it will be worse so other members suggested that we  do what we can afford i.e let her study locally becoz we misunderstood the concept of the scholarship
29/1/24, 5:48 PM - Dev Edoofa: I understand @263776424175, that life is unpredictable, but I think this is all the more reason to plan according to the secure plan. The Edoofa Secure Plan is to help the parents prepare for any kind of financial constraints or any other problems in your life so that the student's future is not compromised. God forbids it, if anything happens to you, then Elexise may have more opportunities to grow herself here in India than in Zimbabwe. I hope you understand?
30/1/24, 11:40 AM - +263 77 642 4175: I do
30/1/24, 12:20 PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Elexise!
