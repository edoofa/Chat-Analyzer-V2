I hope all of you are doing great. While I was wrapping up my day, I observed that we were not able to have a smooth discussion for the past couple of days, which has led to some delay in the admission process. We are aware of your immense trust in us and we surely care about your future. Considering that in mind, I wanted to schedule a specific session tomorrow at 8:30 am so that we can cover the process we are lagging behind,  and ensure that your admission process is on track. Hence, I wanted to understand if you will be available for our session at 8:30am. If not, I would like you to please let me know at what time between 8:30 am to 4 pm will you be available?
8/1/24, 9:09 PM - +263 78 164 7225: Good Evening. We understand your troubles and thank you for getting back to us. 8:30 am is okay. We will be in contact then.

9/1/24, 9:24 AM - Dev Edoofa: Right, now moving forward, let me brief you that your admissions process and your EWYL program will operate concurrently in the future, therefore you will have two Whatsapp groups to connect with the team:
9/1/24, 9:24 AM - Dev Edoofa: 1. The admissions group *Winnie 2K23DEC0895R*  will be the platform where we, as your admission officers, will be communicating with you. This group is dedicated to all-important discussions like your university admission process, offer letter discussion, and ultimately your university registration and reservation of your scholarship along with the Visa process. This group will continue to assist you with your admission-related queries while you are here in India.
9/1/24, 9:24 AM - Dev Edoofa: 2. Earn While You Learn Program *Winnie EWYL23E1049*. In this group, your EWYL mentor, head of the department, and head coach will be present. With this group, we will make sure you are prepared to self-finance your education here in India. With your dedicated efforts in the EWYL program, you will earn maximum scholarship credits.

This group will keep a record of the tasks and projects you undertake. You will be provided with the link to the group after the completion of the admission process session and on the dedicated date for your EWYL session, where you will be able to directly speak to your EWYL mentor. I hope you are clear about the purpose of the two groups.
9/1/24, 9:29 AM - +263 78 164 7225: We are clear about the purpose of the two groups.
9/1/24, 9:29 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to know that you are clear about the purpose of the two WhatsApp groups and it's reassuring to hear this from your end. I also had a recent conversation with your counselor, during which he provided me with some insights into your academic background and career aspirations. I must commend you as a family, you must take great pride in your achievements and be dedicated to ensuring your access to the finest opportunities to launch your career.

Speaking of valuable opportunities, I am also curious to learn more about your counseling session with your counselor and to understand which aspects of the Edoofa Scholarship Program have particularly impressed you thus far. Can you share this with me?
9/1/24, 9:35 AM - +263 78 164 7225: Well our experience with our counselor, Shubham Madhwal, was very pleasant. He was very reassuring and helpful. We had our questions answered before we knew. What really impressed us was the pace of our sessions, he responded quickly and rarely kept us waiting. We were also impressed by the experiences of the EDOOFA students that he shared with us to reassure us of the progress and effectiveness of the program. <This message was edited>
9/1/24, 9:46 AM - Dev Edoofa: I have known Mr. Shubham for a long time and he always ensures that each and every student of his gets personalized attention so that he can ensure their academic career is on track. 
We, at Edoofa, are determined to provide affordable higher education to all and assist hardworking students in launching their careers in their respective fields.  

We are delightful that you are impressed by the the Edoofa scholarship Program.

9/1/24, 9:50 AM - +263 78 164 7225: not yet unfortunately, printing services are not available at the moment but we will be in the city in this week and it will be done.
9/1/24, 9:53 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. But I would highly recommend you to print the forms as soon as possible. As those forms are important to move forward with our sessions.
9/1/24, 9:54 AM - Dev Edoofa: I hope you understand?

9/1/24, 9:58 AM - +263 78 164 7225: Is it possible to fill the forms in on the phone? Is that an option? <This message was edited>
9/1/24, 10:09 AM - Dev Edoofa: Since these are essential forms that need to be filled, these are supposed to be handwritten. That is why our main emphasis was on getting the forms printed.

9/1/24, 4:28 PM - +263 78 164 7225: Thank you so much
9/1/24, 8:07 PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Winnie.

I hope all of you are having a wonderful day. Today I had a meeting with the academic board and I was discussing the current status of your application file and in the same discussion, the team higjlighted that we have been a bit off track for the discusisons we were suppsed to completed and hence I wanted to reach out to you and just reiteratre the agenda of the sessions/discusisons we have in place.
9/1/24, 8:07 PM - Dev Edoofa: The agenda for these sessions is to help you understand the process Winnie will undertake for his university admission journey and what your family will be experiencing with the Edoofa Scholarship Program over the next one and a half years. However, since Winnie is in school and you are occupied with work during the day, it seems that the same challenge in connectivity is going to persist for the next couple of months as well.
9/1/24, 8:07 PM - Dev Edoofa: If you see, our goal is to help you prepare for your child's education abroad, that is something that is going to require a significant time. It requires months of planning. Hence, to do that perfectly and be prepared, as a parent, you would have to contribute an hour daily for at least 10 days so that we can be in sync and make the right decisions.
9/1/24, 8:07 PM - Dev Edoofa: We, at Edoofa, are determined to provide affordable higher education to hardworking students and assist them in launching their careers to greater heights. We will be able to help you only if we can connect timely and have healthy discussions.
9/1/24, 8:07 PM - Dev Edoofa: With that being said, what I can do right now to solve this constraint is give you the freedom to choose the time slot for our sessions over the next 10 days [till 20th January]. This way, we can align it with our availability as well and help you move forward and make progress in a streamlined manner. Could you please let me know at what time you would be available from Monday to Friday between 08:00 AM and 06:00 PM? This would help us factor in your inputs and find the right time for our sessions.
9/1/24, 8:26 PM - +263 78 164 7225: Good evening. Yes we are currently occupied at the moment. Thank you for offering us the convenience of communicating when available. *11:00 AM* is the appropriate time for us.
14/1/24, 4:12 AM - +263 78 164 7225: Hello

15/1/24, 2:12 PM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for informing @263781647225 about your situation and I completely understand.

How are you all doing?
17/1/24, 1:14 PM - +263 78 164 7225: Good afternoon sir. We are well thanks and you
17/1/24, 1:28 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am doing great as well. Thanks for asking! May I know if you are ready for our session today?

17/1/24, 1:39 PM - Dev Edoofa: That is great! Moving forward in our today’s session, we will discuss a bit about your university admission journey. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts. I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them.

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
17/1/24, 1:40 PM - +263 78 164 7225: Yes we can start
17/1/24, 1:51 PM - Dev Edoofa: <Media omitted>
17/1/24, 1:54 PM - +263 78 164 7225: I’m done
17/1/24, 2:05 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
17/1/24, 2:05 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
17/1/24, 2:07 PM - +263 78 164 7225: That’s clear
17/1/24, 2:10 PM - Dev Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
17/1/24, 2:10 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
17/1/24, 2:18 PM - +263 78 164 7225: I’m following
17/1/24, 2:23 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process, the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
17/1/24, 2:23 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
17/1/24, 2:27 PM - +263 78 164 7225: That’s all clear
17/1/24, 2:29 PM - Dev Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
17/1/24, 2:30 PM - +263 78 164 7225: Yes
17/1/24, 2:32 PM - +263 78 164 7225: <Media omitted>
17/1/24, 2:35 PM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for sharing! I have taken note of it and will update it in our records.
17/1/24, 2:36 PM - +263 78 164 7225: <Media omitted>
17/1/24, 2:36 PM - +263 78 164 7225: Thank you
17/1/24, 2:36 PM - Dev Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
17/1/24, 2:36 PM - Dev Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding until you are ready, shall we start with our discussion with me individually? 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
17/1/24, 2:37 PM - +263 78 164 7225: Yes I’m ready
17/1/24, 2:39 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students*

This is a video by the founders of EDOOFA, in which they share 2 important qualities of successful Edoofians- who've secured a maximum scholarship and earned scholarship credits.

17/1/24, 2:39 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

The third video is about Schools, Colleges, and Universities. I'm sure you're excited to learn more about the schools, colleges, and universities on the Edoofa Platform. Founders talk about their decade-long journey of discovering these schools and the experiences that students are having in these schools.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DW82emflFHw&feature=youtu.be
17/1/24, 2:39 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP*

The fourth video is about the Statement of Purpose (SOP). The most important step towards securing a good scholarship is to write the Statement of Purpose but to know why it is important, watching this video will clear your doubts and questions.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftsGGGBYMrs&feature=youtu.be
17/1/24, 2:40 PM - Dev Edoofa: I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes if you have a smooth internet connection. 

Please go through the 4 videos, our next session will be scheduled after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarize your understanding.
17/1/24, 3:44 PM - +263 78 164 7225: Thank you I’m done watching the videos
17/1/24, 3:50 PM - Dev Edoofa: That is wonderful to hear. In that case, we will be concluding the conversation for now and we will reconnect tomorrow at 1:30 pm for our next session. Wish you a blessed evening ahead and please ensure to extend our regards to your family as well.

17/1/24, 9:22 PM - +263 78 164 7225: No problem at all
18/1/24, 12:33 PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Winnie! I hope you are doing well and are off to a wonderful start to your day. We have our session right now. May I please know if you are ready for our conversation?

18/1/24, 12:48 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that! Before moving forward, may I know your understanding of each of the 4 videos?
18/1/24, 1:21 PM - +263 78 164 7225: I understand the passion of the founders in first video when I comes to helping potential students in achieving their dreams. The second one I learnt that students are helped to become successful and independent. The third one shows that Edoofa program forcus on finding the best universities and colleges for the students. The fourth video puts emphasis on how important The statement of purpose document is. <This message was edited>
18/1/24, 1:28 PM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your detailed understanding of the sessions, @263781647225. I believe that you were able to feel the essence of the videos as well.
18/1/24, 1:28 PM - Dev Edoofa: Brilliant, Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
18/1/24, 1:28 PM - +263 78 164 7225: Yes we are
18/1/24, 1:34 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that! Now, it is our responsibility to move Winnie's application ahead and help you write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, hence, Winnie has to complete the following tasks:
18/1/24, 1:35 PM - Dev Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

https://goo.gl/forms/iWss6zPuOFbnGTXK2
18/1/24, 1:35 PM - Dev Edoofa: 2. I am sharing two documents with you. Kindly go through both documents and submit your responses to the course document here in the group. Make sure you research well before starting the task. All the best!
18/1/24, 1:35 PM - Dev Edoofa: <Media omitted>
18/1/24, 1:35 PM - Dev Edoofa: <Media omitted>
18/1/24, 1:36 PM - Dev Edoofa: Once you share these documents and complete the two tasks that have been provided to you, we will have completed the second step of your university admission process.

18/1/24, 1:41 PM - +263 78 164 7225: How much time are we given to complete the two tasks?
18/1/24, 1:51 PM - Dev Edoofa: We will connect tomorrow at 3:00 PM to move ahead with our discussion and want you to complete the tasks before our session. I understand that Winnie is at school, but I would recommend she spare 30 minutes to complete the above tasks, or if not you can connect with her and complete the tasks on her behalf. I hope you understand, as delay can hamper the further process.
19/1/24, 2:54 PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Winnie!
I hope you are doing well. We have our session right now. May I know if you are ready to take forward our conversation?

19/1/24, 3:23 PM - +263 78 164 7225: Unfortunately Winnie couldn’t be available. I spoke to the school and she can contact me this afternoon
19/1/24, 3:23 PM - +263 78 164 7225: Sorry boarding schools in Zimbabwe are too strict
22/1/24, 3:44 PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Afternoon Mrs. Maruwa!
I hope you are doing well. I understand the concerns that you are facing. Schools are strict with the use of electronics on these school's premises and it is much appreciated as well. I would recommend that Winnie spare 30 minutes to provide the answers to the documents as well as the SOP form. As delays will affect her admission journey. I hope you understand my concern?
22/1/24, 3:46 PM - +263 78 164 7225: Good afternoon sir. We are well thank you. 

We are wrapping up her response. They will be ready tomorrow.
22/1/24, 3:46 PM - +263 78 164 7225: <Media omitted>
22/1/24, 3:51 PM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you so much for the SOP response. I have taken note of it and eagerly waiting for the response to the document as well.
23/1/24, 1:27 PM - +263 78 164 7225: Good afternoon sir. I hope you doing well.
23/1/24, 1:27 PM - +263 78 164 7225: <Media omitted>
23/1/24, 1:28 PM - +263 78 164 7225: 2, Rights are the basic entitlements a citizen should have, simply by being born. There are many types of rights which are meant to protect a citizen at any stage of their life. Meanwhile Duties are what individuals are obligated to do as law abiding citizens towards others, society and the government. Duties are required to maintain order and justice in the society. Examples of duties include obeying laws, paying taxes and so on.

Human Rights are the base or core of rights of human beings. They are the right to live, the right to education, protection from torture, freedom of expression and fair trial. They are the necessities of the human existence. These rights are the starting point to a civilised and functioning society. 

Civil Rights are the ones entitled to a citizen in a particular nation. They protect a citizen from discrimination such as discrimination based on race, sex, culture and other characteristics. Civil Rights also give them certain freedoms, for example, Freedom of speech, equal protection, freedom of religion and so on. These rights may differ from country to country. Civil rights stand as an agreement between the nation and the citizen in it. <This message was edited>
23/1/24, 1:30 PM - +263 78 164 7225: 3, A prosecutor is a lawyer who represents the government in criminal cases. Their role is in the presentation of evidence against certain individuals accused of committing a crime. They seek justice on behalf of the government to prove guilt of the accused individual beyond a reasonable doubt. Prosecutors are employed by the government. They can also be referred to as district attorneys.

However, an attorney is also a legal professional and provides legal advice and represents clients in legal matters that range from criminal matters to corporate matters. They can work with individuals, businesses, or organizations either in criminal and civil cases. Attorneys can specialize in criminal law, family law, corporate law or immigration law. Attorneys have the option to own their own practice or work for an already existing law firm. In the courtroom or during a case they work hard to prove beyond reasonable doubt for their client’s innocence. This is where the difference between an attorney and the prosecutor lie. <This message was edited>
23/1/24, 1:30 PM - +263 78 164 7225: 4, I’m mostly interested in corporate law. Corporate law is the perfect combination of law and business, which are my two key interests. I feel by being a corporate lawyer I get the opportunity of enjoying both worlds. Being a corporate lawyer means I can practice my passion for law while exploring the vast business world. For me exposure to big businesses will be the highlight of my career. I will love the traveling and sitting in business meetings while getting the in-depth understanding of business practices, documents and regulations. As a corporate lawyer I will have an opportunity to manage several projects simultaneously. Corporate lawyers rarely attend court. I would rather spend a lot of time in the office and taking part in meetings, writing legal documents, advising executives, and negotiating contracts. I believe the job of a corporate lawyer is diverse so I will need to study various fields such as criminal law, risk, merger, and tax. I believe by becoming a successful corporate lawyer my long term goals will broaden. Corporate law is also one of the most lucrative professions which makes my dream of independence come true. <This message was edited>
23/1/24, 1:31 PM - +263 78 164 7225: 5, From a young age public speaking was always a skill I needed and used. From addressing the school as Head Girl to improvising a disquisition as Junior Member of Parliament, this will be just one of my skills that I apply in the courtroom.
An additional skill is one I learnt from experience. Leaving one country to settle in another taught me how to be adaptable and it also taught me how to use good judgement in new situations. I had to learn to be adaptable to the new cultures of the people around me.
My organisational skills are evident in my school work. I believe organisation works hand in hand with attention to detail. I make sure everything I do is done to the best of my ability, and a bit more. 
As an aspiring lawyer it is imperative that my communication skills – especially with individuals –  are the best they can be. It is important to be able to communicate with people from all walks of life. I grew up exposed to many cultures and with many people with different backgrounds, which taught me a lot about understanding people. <This message was edited>
23/1/24, 2:33 PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parent and Winnie!
I hope you are doing well. Thank you for sharing the SOP form and responses to the form. I have taken complete note of it and will update it in our records as well. We can move forward with our session. May I know if you are ready to take forward our conversation now?
23/1/24, 2:43 PM - +263 78 164 7225: Yes sir I’m ready
23/1/24, 2:47 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that!  With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey.

Before we proceed to the next stage, I'd like to assist you in getting started with your EWYL Journey. Due to some delays, your EWYL sessions were not started on time. However, you are now scheduled to commence your EWYL journey today (23rd January 2024).

To kick-start the process, your dedicated EWYL Mentor has established your EWYL Group and shared the invitation link with us. Here's what you and your parents/guardian/sponsor need to do:

23/1/24, 3:54 PM - +263 78 164 7225: Thank you sir. Enjoy your evening.
24/1/24, 3:20 PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Winnie!
I hope you are doing well. We have our session right now. May I know if you are available for our conversation?
24/1/24, 4:30 PM - +263 78 164 7225: Good afternoon. My apologies I was not able to chat earlier
26/1/24, 9:37 AM - Dev Edoofa: Good Morning @263781647225 and Winnie!
I hope you are doing well and are having a wonderful start to the day. I felt a bit under the weather yesterday, so I took a day off to focus on my health. Today, I am feeling better and completely ready to take our conversation forward. We will have our session at 3:00 PM to take forward our conversation. May I know if you are going to be available at that time? <This message was edited>
26/1/24, 9:38 AM - Dev Edoofa: No need to apologize, @263781647225!
26/1/24, 10:14 AM - +263 78 164 7225: Good morning sir

Good to hear you feeling good today. 

Yes I will be available today at 3pm
26/1/24, 3:28 PM - Dev Edoofa: Good afternoon @263781647225!
I hope you are doing well. May I know if you are ready to take forward our conversation?
26/1/24, 3:29 PM - +263 78 164 7225: Good afternoon sir. 
Yes I’m ready
26/1/24, 3:41 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that!  We have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey. we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*.
26/1/24, 3:41 PM - Dev Edoofa: However, before we start the same, I was going through your scholarship application file and noticed that you are supposed to make the payment of your remaining part of Edoofa Enrollment fee. Hence, I thought of sharing a gentle reminder with you and trying to understand how your preparation has been so far? Have you been able to align your preparations in the right direction?
26/1/24, 3:44 PM - +263 78 164 7225: I’ve already made a payment of $350(USD) plus 12% how much is outstanding? <This message was edited>
26/1/24, 3:45 PM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. I have checked that you are done with the payment of enrollment fees. I hope you understand this genuine mistake?
26/1/24, 3:46 PM - +263 78 164 7225: No problem at all
26/1/24, 3:49 PM - Dev Edoofa: Thanks for understanding. In the meantime. Let us move forward with our discussion. To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is BA LLB and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2025. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
26/1/24, 3:51 PM - +263 78 164 7225: Yes it is correct
26/1/24, 4:00 PM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. Based on our experience of over 14 years and having assisted over 5000 students from different countries, we have realized that financial planning is the most important factor when a student plans for his/her higher education abroad.
26/1/24, 4:00 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am sure that you must be aware that 20-30% of students who are admitted into universities abroad are unable to fulfill their dream and come to India due to a lack of financial planning. The funds needed for booking flights, accommodation, and covering living expenses after arrival often become overwhelming, leading to the decision to defer their admission for a year. This, in turn, creates a gap in the child's education.
26/1/24, 4:00 PM - Dev Edoofa: To assist both students and parents in this regard, Edoofa Management has designed a Financial Secure Plan that aims to help you prepare for your higher educational finances without experiencing stress or last-minute rushes. I believe you must be wondering about the details of the same plan and how it helps the parents?
26/1/24, 4:04 PM - +263 78 164 7225: I definitely need to know the details
26/1/24, 4:05 PM - Dev Edoofa: Edoofa Secure Plan is important for parents who have children joining the university for tertiary education in the next one to two years for several reasons:
26/1/24, 4:05 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Financial Preparedness:* The Edoofa Secure plan helps parents prepare financially for the costs after the Scholarship being offered so that they are not caught off guard.

*Reduced Financial Stress:* Having the Edoofa Secure Plan in place can significantly reduce the financial stress on you as parents when your child is about to enter university. Knowing that there is a dedicated fund for education expenses provides peace of mind.
26/1/24, 4:05 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Avoiding Debt*: Without proper savings, some parents may resort to taking out loans or accumulating credit card debt to cover their child's education costs. This Educational savings plan helps avoid the burden of debt and high-interest payments.

*Compound Interest:* By starting to save early and consistently contributing to the savings plan, parents can take advantage of compound interest, which can significantly increase the amount available for education expenses.
26/1/24, 4:05 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Flexibility and Control:* The Edoofa Secure savings plans allow parents to have greater control over their finances and how they allocate funds for their child's education. They can choose investment options that align with their risk tolerance and financial goals.

*Encouraging Responsibility*: Involving your child in the process of saving for their education teaches them financial responsibility and the value of higher education. It also motivates them to outperform in Academics.
26/1/24, 4:05 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Adapting to Unexpected Changes*: Life is full of surprises, and circumstances can change especially when there are political reforms changing each day impacting the Local Currency. Having an Edoofa Secure Plan allows parents to adapt to unexpected changes in their financial situation while still prioritizing their child's education.

*Peace of Mind:* Overall, having the Edoofa Secure plan provides parents with peace of mind, knowing that they are actively planning for their child's future and increasing the likelihood of providing them with a solid education.
26/1/24, 4:05 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, when you go through all the above benefits, I am sure you can see that the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan is an important financial tool for parents/students who are supposed to enter the university soon. 

It helps ensure that the financial aspect of tertiary education is well-managed, reduces stress, and allows parents to provide the best opportunities for their children without resorting to debt or financial hardship. Isn't this something you and your family also wish to have?
26/1/24, 4:09 PM - +263 78 164 7225: We definitely wish for that
26/1/24, 4:13 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through the above points, do you want me to help you understand how the Edoofa Secure Plan works?
26/1/24, 4:15 PM - +263 78 164 7225: Yes please
26/1/24, 4:26 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that! As you are aware, we are currently in January 2024, and we have a good 20 months to plan for your finances before you start your university education in 2025.
26/1/24, 4:26 PM - Dev Edoofa: During the counseling session, you were informed that at Edoofa, we guarantee a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship on the tuition fees. Hence, the cost of education, including food and accommodation after the scholarship, would be between $2000-$3000, and it could be even less. Not more than that.
26/1/24, 4:26 PM - Dev Edoofa: This means that if you can save $150 per month for the next 20 months, you will be able to save $3000. This amount is more than enough for the first year of university fees, including tuition fees (if any), food, and accommodation. I hope you agree with this?
26/1/24, 4:29 PM - +263 78 164 7225: I agree
26/1/24, 4:35 PM - Dev Edoofa: Right, this means that by the time you would be in India, you would have already saved the $3000 that will cover the first-year fee.
26/1/24, 4:35 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, in these next 20 months, I am sure you would also be engaged in the EWYL program, and if you secure a minimum of $1000 in 20 months, that means the fees for 1.5 years are already secured.
26/1/24, 4:35 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, for a 3-year course, if we follow the same approach for the remaining 1.5 years, the educational journey for the student and the financial journey for the parent will be easy and smooth. I believe you must be able to see this perspective?
26/1/24, 4:37 PM - +263 78 164 7225: That’s true
26/1/24, 4:46 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. With that said, there is also another benefit, I am sure being in Zimbabwe you know how drastically the exchange rate fluctuates.
26/1/24, 4:46 PM - Dev Edoofa: If you are buying a dollar today, you might be spending 7000 bonds, but if you buy a dollar after a month, the rate would be different.
26/1/24, 4:46 PM - Dev Edoofa: Also, even if you choose to buy dollars every month and save at your home, it is not safe since there is news of robbery, and mugging every day.
26/1/24, 4:46 PM - Dev Edoofa: In that case, you will opt to save in the Bank, but again we know that savings in the Bank require a Nostro Account which means you have to pay the bank to keep your money safe, right?
26/1/24, 4:48 PM - +263 78 164 7225: Yes that’s all true
26/1/24, 4:51 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Program Fee (Enrollment Fee) that you were asked to pay is $350.
26/1/24, 4:51 PM - Dev Edoofa: Under the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan, a parent has to deposit a small amount of money which is $150 every month for the next 10 months. 

That means, in 10 months, the money saved will be $1500.
26/1/24, 4:51 PM - Dev Edoofa: Imagine you paying $15 every month to the Bank of Zimbabwe to keep your money safe, and here Edoofa is paying you $15 every month to keep your money safe. Now, you must be wondering, why only for 10 months and not for 20 months, right?
26/1/24, 5:00 PM - +263 78 164 7225: Yes please I would like to hear how?
26/1/24, 5:11 PM - Dev Edoofa: If you see the bigger picture, you will realize that the reason is quite simple. Upon the completion of the 10 installments, the Edoofa Admissions team will initiate the Child’s Admission Process by applying early to the universities to secure their scholarship and their university seat.
26/1/24, 5:11 PM - Dev Edoofa: Reserving seats earlier increases the chances of obtaining a maximum scholarship. A higher scholarship means lower fees, and by securing the seat, you will be entitled to pay the fees as per the old fee structure of the university, not the new one implemented in January 2025. Furthermore, when applying to the universities, you will receive an offer letter or a letter of intent detailing the fees, scholarship, and registration fees.
26/1/24, 5:11 PM - Dev Edoofa: As explained during the enrollment process, the registration fee is a portion of your first-year university fee, paid to reserve the seat. It ranges from $500-$1000 and is not an additional fee. 

From the $1500 you saved with Edoofa, the registration fee will be paid to the university, securing the seat. For instance, if the registration fee is $1000, Edoofa will pay $1000 from the $1500 saved in 10 months. The updated balance with Edoofa will be $500, which will be paid to the university upon your arrival in India.
26/1/24, 5:12 PM - Dev Edoofa: This eases the financial burden on the parent, as there is no immediate payment required upon the student's arrival. The $500 saved will cover the remaining fees for the semester/year, as specified in the offer letter from the university. What are your thoughts on this?
26/1/24, 5:16 PM - +263 78 164 7225: I think it sounds like a good plan.
26/1/24, 5:19 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to see that we are together so far. With this plan for the next 10 months, I am sure you must be wondering what will happen in the next 10 months, considering you have already secured your scholarship seat with the university due to your hard work in the first 10 months. Is my understanding correct?
26/1/24, 5:28 PM - +263 78 164 7225: Yes
26/1/24, 5:29 PM - Dev Edoofa: Let me help you with that as well. In the 11th month, you will be guided to open an FBC Mastercard bank account in Zimbabwe with a deposit of $150. The reason for this is that when you apply for your student Visa, the Embassy asks for a Bank Statement, and this account will serve that purpose.
26/1/24, 5:29 PM - Dev Edoofa: We understand it might be expensive if you deposit another $1500 for the remaining 10 months in FB  Bank Zimbabwe, so to avoid the same challenges, we have designed the plan accordingly. You will only be depositing for the 11th, 12th, 13th, and 14th month, which is 4 months.
26/1/24, 5:29 PM - Dev Edoofa: Once the 4 months are completed, our Department of Student Welfare (DSW) team will assist you with your visa process. The bank statement will act as one of the required documents, and once you receive the visa, you can withdraw the amount from FBC and book the flight ticket. This will help you utilize the money as well. How does it sound?
26/1/24, 6:15 PM - +263 78 164 7225: It sounds like a great plan
26/1/24, 6:46 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, from the 16th Month till the 20th month, considering it is a 6-month window, you can again continue depositing the money ($150) with Edoofa which can be used in the fee as and when required or you can decide to save this $900 of these 6 months with you as well. This is something which you are free to choose. I hope you have understood the financial secure plan now?
26/1/24, 6:50 PM - +263 78 164 7225: I understand the plan but I’m going to give my husband a chance to understand as well
26/1/24, 8:18 PM - Dev Edoofa: That's perfectly fine. In that case, we will conclude today's conversation, and I will connect with you tomorrow to resume our discussion. In the meantime, I hope you'll have a detailed discussion with your family and jot down any questions or thoughts you have regarding the Financial Secure plan.

Wishing you a good night, and please extend our regards to your family.
27/1/24, 11:48 AM - Dev Edoofa: Good Afternoon @263781647225!

Please, how are you doing today? With regard to our discussion yesterday, I wanted to reach out and enquire if you are available for us to have a brief conversation?
27/1/24, 12:03 PM - +263 78 164 7225: Good morning. I’m well thanks how are you?
27/1/24, 12:03 PM - +263 78 164 7225: Yes I am
27/1/24, 12:09 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you are doing well and are available for us to connect with each other. Before reaching out to you today, I was going through pictures and videos from Edoofa's very first SLICE CON held last week, and that sparked my curiosity about whether you are familiar with what SLICE CON is or not?
27/1/24, 12:16 PM - +263 78 164 7225: No I’m not
27/1/24, 12:25 PM - Dev Edoofa: That is alright, Let me tell you a bit about the same.  Recently, Edoofa hosted a conference called the Symposium of Leaders, Innovators, and Creators at Edoofa, also known as 'SLICE-CON.'
27/1/24, 12:25 PM - Dev Edoofa: The conference was attended by all the Edoofians of 2023 and a few senior Edoofians from previous batches. It focused on the art of creation, innovation, and, most importantly, the mindset required to make an impact in one's career.
27/1/24, 12:26 PM - Dev Edoofa: During this Industrial Visit and the conference - SLICE CON, Corporate leaders, such as the CEOs and Co-founders from renowned companies like Rage Coffee, Sirona Hygiene, Jolin New York, and more, shared their insights and experiences. These individuals are at the helm of multi-millionaire brands, leading large marketing teams. Their presence added immense value, providing students with the opportunity to engage in transformative conversations.
27/1/24, 12:26 PM - Dev Edoofa: Let me share a glimpse of the conference with you and your family, I am certain that Delight too would be this excited to attend such events when he comes to India.

27/1/24, 12:30 PM - Dev Edoofa: Thanks for noticing this. I hope you understand that I am conversing with many students right so such genuine mistake may happen?
27/1/24, 12:32 PM - +263 78 164 7225: Thank you for sharing the above
27/1/24, 12:34 PM - Dev Edoofa: You are most welcome!  This was indeed a momentous step for all of our students, making them employable ready and giving them access to the right opportunities for their careers ahead.
27/1/24, 12:35 PM - +263 78 164 7225: Awesome
27/1/24, 12:36 PM - Dev Edoofa: Certainly, @263781647225. Also, regarding the discussion we had the other day about the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan, I wanted to follow up on our last conversation. Have you, as a family, been able to discuss it? If so, I would like to understand how the discussion went. What were their thoughts about it? Did they have any specific queries or concerns that you would like us to address?
27/1/24, 12:38 PM - +263 78 164 7225: We discussed but unfortunately my husband will only have time this afternoon to sit down and go through our conversation as he doesn’t get much time during the day to follow our conversation.
27/1/24, 12:47 PM - Dev Edoofa: I understand @263781647225! You can surely have a discussion with your husband and let us know if you have any queries if they arise.
27/1/24, 12:47 PM - +263 78 164 7225: I will do that
27/1/24, 12:47 PM - Dev Edoofa: Great!
29/1/24, 3:31 PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Afternoon @263781647225!
I hope you are doing well and had a great weekend. May I know if you were able to discuss the plan with your family in detail?
29/1/24, 3:53 PM - +263 78 164 7225: Good afternoon sir.  

Yes we had our discussion
29/1/24, 4:06 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that! May I know if you have any queries regarding the plan?
29/1/24, 4:13 PM - +263 78 164 7225: I think we understand most of it. Is there a way of depositing the money if I’m not in Zimbabwe?
29/1/24, 4:28 PM - Dev Edoofa: May I know from which country are you planning to deposit the money? This will help us to assist accordingly.
29/1/24, 4:29 PM - +263 78 164 7225: South Africa
29/1/24, 5:00 PM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know, @263781647225. We are surely going to discuss how can we move ahead with the mode of payments further. May I know if you have any other queries regarding the plan?
29/1/24, 5:01 PM - +263 78 164 7225: No we are good
29/1/24, 5:04 PM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know, @263781647225 . For the current round of students, there are only 27 seats available for the students who can benefit from the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan. 

Since she has been one of the most dedicated students, and I see she has great aspirations, I wanted her to be a part of the same set of students and start with her future planning the right way.
29/1/24, 5:04 PM - Dev Edoofa: Also, as this plan commences from the month of January, for the efficient implementation of this plan, we need to decide on a fixed date on which you will deposit $150 every month. This will provide you with the flexibility to align your finances accordingly.
29/1/24, 5:04 PM - Dev Edoofa: Our complete focus is on providing students and parents with the best ways to avail themselves of these opportunities. We understand that every parent may not be able to make the payment on our specified date. Therefore, considering this situation, we allow them to decide the payment date according to their comfort. In light of the same, may I know the fixed date every month on which you will deposit $150?
29/1/24, 5:08 PM - +263 78 164 7225: I would like to go with the 15th
29/1/24, 5:09 PM - Dev Edoofa: Starting from which month? February, right?
29/1/24, 5:10 PM - +263 78 164 7225: Will try our best yes
29/1/24, 5:13 PM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for sharing these details, your commitment to securing a seat in this exclusive program is appreciated.

To proceed with the next steps, we will be sharing an official agreement detailing the specifics of the Financial Secure Plan along with its benefits. This agreement is a crucial document that outlines the terms and conditions of your participation in the program. It serves as a legal framework ensuring transparency and mutual understanding between all parties involved.
29/1/24, 5:13 PM - Dev Edoofa: As we prepare to send you the agreement, we kindly request the following details to personalize the document:
