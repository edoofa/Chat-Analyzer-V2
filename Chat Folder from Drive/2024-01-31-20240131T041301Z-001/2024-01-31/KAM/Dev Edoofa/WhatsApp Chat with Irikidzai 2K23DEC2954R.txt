27/1/24, 7:27 AM - Dev Edoofa: Good Morning @263776194524 @263773201523!
I hope you are doing well. Yesterday, we were not able to take forward our conversation as the forms were not filled, so may I know if the forms are completely filled?
27/1/24, 10:29 AM - +263 77 320 1523: We are working on it
27/1/24, 11:41 AM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know about it. May I know when will you be done with the forms?
27/1/24, 11:44 AM - +263 77 320 1523: Please give us more time. By end of day we will be done
27/1/24, 12:04 PM - +263 77 320 1523: There is a requirement of passport sized photos. Yet Irikidzai is at school. Please help. What do we do
27/1/24, 12:08 PM - Dev Edoofa: May I know if you have any passport-size photo of Irikidzai, which you may have used for any other paperwork?
27/1/24, 12:19 PM - +263 77 320 1523: We do not have any passport sized photos
27/1/24, 12:23 PM - Dev Edoofa: This message was deleted
27/1/24, 12:25 PM - Dev Edoofa: Okay, I understand! Do you have any photo of Irikidzai with light background so that it can be pasted on the form or any other photo of her?
27/1/24, 12:39 PM - +263 77 320 1523: We have her photos yes
27/1/24, 12:49 PM - Dev Edoofa: You can paste one one of those photos keeping in mind the size of the page and the photo.

I hope you are doing well and had a wonderful weekend. May I know if the forms are completely filled out?
29/1/24, 11:46 AM - +263 77 619 4524: Almost we are still sorting out the issues with the passport sized photo
29/1/24, 11:56 AM - Dev Edoofa: Thanks for letting me know. I would recommend you complete the forms on time as we are already lagging behind a little from the timelines, and this can eventually seriously affect Irikidzai's admission journey. I hope you understand?
