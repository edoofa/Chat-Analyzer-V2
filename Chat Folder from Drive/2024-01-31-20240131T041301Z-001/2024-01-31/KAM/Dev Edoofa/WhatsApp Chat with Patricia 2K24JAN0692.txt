18/1/24, 11:41 AM - Dev Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Amanda. I hope you are doing well and are off to a wonderful start to your day.

18/1/24, 11:41 AM - Dev Edoofa: We have our session right now. May I please know if you are ready for our conversation?
18/1/24, 12:15 PM - +263 77 116 6703: Afternoon Sir.Am ready

18/1/24, 12:19 PM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the documents. I have taken note of them and will update them in our records!
18/1/24, 12:19 PM - Dev Edoofa: Moving forward in our today’s session, we will discuss a bit about your university admission journey. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts. I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them.

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
18/1/24, 12:31 PM - +263 77 116 6703: Ready
18/1/24, 12:40 PM - Dev Edoofa: <Media omitted>
18/1/24, 1:15 PM - +263 77 116 6703: Done Sir
18/1/24, 1:17 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
18/1/24, 1:17 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
18/1/24, 1:24 PM - +263 77 116 6703: Clear Sir
18/1/24, 1:30 PM - Dev Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
18/1/24, 1:30 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
18/1/24, 1:54 PM - +263 77 116 6703: Am following Sir.
18/1/24, 1:56 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process, the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
18/1/24, 1:56 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
18/1/24, 3:06 PM - +263 77 116 6703: They are very clear sir
18/1/24, 3:19 PM - +263 78 322 2565: <Media omitted>

18/1/24, 9:14 PM - Dev Edoofa: Take note that your session is scheduled for 12:30 PM instead of 11:30 PM. There was a genuine typing mistake. I hope you understand? <This message was edited>
18/1/24, 9:15 PM - +263 78 322 2565: understand sir
19/1/24, 12:35 PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Patricia!
I hope you are doing well. We have our session right now. May I know if you are ready to take forward our conversation?
19/1/24, 1:27 PM - +263 77 116 6703: Afternoon Sir
19/1/24, 1:27 PM - +263 77 116 6703: Ready
19/1/24, 1:28 PM - Dev Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
19/1/24, 1:37 PM - +263 77 116 6703: Yes we can start
19/1/24, 1:39 PM - Dev Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
19/1/24, 1:39 PM - Dev Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding until you are ready, shall we start with our discussion with me individually? 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
19/1/24, 1:41 PM - +263 77 116 6703: Ready
19/1/24, 1:43 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students*

This is a video by the founders of EDOOFA, in which they share 2 important qualities of successful Edoofians- who've secured a maximum scholarship and earned scholarship credits.

https://youtu.be/SIh6DcQsqYM
19/1/24, 1:43 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s vision for you*

This is another video of the founders, where they share the vision of Edoofa at a core level. Founders also talk more about the most important character trait that distinguishes a successful student from the rest of the crowd.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q44qkd4wc7o
19/1/24, 1:43 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

The third video is about Schools, Colleges, and Universities. I'm sure you're excited to learn more about the schools, colleges, and universities on the Edoofa Platform. Founders talk about their decade-long journey of discovering these schools and the experiences that students are having in these schools.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DW82emflFHw&feature=youtu.be
19/1/24, 1:44 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP*

The fourth video is about the Statement of Purpose (SOP). The most important step towards securing a good scholarship is to write the Statement of Purpose but to know why it is important, watching this video will clear your doubts and questions.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftsGGGBYMrs&feature=youtu.be
19/1/24, 1:44 PM - Dev Edoofa: @263771166703 , I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes if you have a smooth internet connection. 

Please go through the 4 videos, our next session will be scheduled after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarize your understanding.
19/1/24, 1:44 PM - Dev Edoofa: I hope you are clear with the instructions?
19/1/24, 2:08 PM - +263 77 116 6703: They are clear
19/1/24, 2:09 PM - Dev Edoofa: That is wonderful to hear. In that case, we will be concluding the conversation for now and we will reconnect tomorrow at 12:30 pm for our next session.

20/1/24, 2:49 PM - +263 78 322 2565: Good Afternoon sir
20/1/24, 2:51 PM - +263 78 322 2565: From the videos that I have gone through I have understood that in order to have a successful journey with Edoofa a student has to follow instructions and be open minded. Edoofa's vision is not just to get students affordable quality education and making students employable through the SEELS program, but it is focused on increasing student's capacity for success, making students more responsible and independent. Also the founders encourage students to follow instructions so as to prepare and be qualified for the prestigious institutions that Edoofa has invested a lot of time to identify good schools, colleges and universities for passionate Edoofians. Lastly they talked about the Statement of purpose which is an important document in which students should be prompt in taking action , and be diligent in filling out the form.
22/1/24, 12:46 PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Afternoon Mr. and Mrs. Mudzuri and Patricia!

22/1/24, 2:12 PM - Dev Edoofa: You are most welcome. Shall we move ahead?
22/1/24, 2:12 PM - +263 78 322 2565: yes sir
22/1/24, 2:13 PM - Dev Edoofa: Great! Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
22/1/24, 3:26 PM - +263 77 116 6703: Afternoon sir

22/1/24, 3:31 PM - +263 78 322 2565: lets continue
22/1/24, 3:54 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, you need to complete the following tasks:
22/1/24, 3:54 PM - Dev Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded.

22/1/24, 9:59 PM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the responses to the SOP form. I am eagerly waiting for the responses to the academic document as well.
22/1/24, 10:59 PM - +263 78 322 2565: <Media omitted>
22/1/24, 11:35 PM - +263 78 322 2565: 2) To commence with Rights are entitlements that an individual has that should be respected and protected by others. Duties, on the other hand, are obligations that an individual has to others. While rights and duties may seem to be opposites, they are actually complementary and interdependent. Rights can only be exercised if there are corresponding duties that others have to respect and uphold them. Similarly, duties only make sense when there are corresponding rights to which they relate.Human rights and civil rights are closely related, but they do have some key differences. Human rights are universal and inalienable, they apply to all people regardless of their nationality, race, religion, or other factors. They are also considered to be inherent and inviolable, meaning that they cannot be taken away and must be protected at all costs. Civil rights are specific legal rights that are granted to individuals by the government, usually through legislation. Civil rights are more limited in scope and vary from country to country. They can also be changed or revoked by the government.



3) To begin with , there is a difference between a prosecutor and an attonery .A prosecutor and an attorney may seem similar, but there are some key differences between the two roles. An attorney is a general term that refers to any licensed legal professional. This can include prosecutors, as well as defense attorneys, corporate lawyers, and many other types of lawyers. A prosecutor, on the other hand, is a specific type of attorney who works for the government and represents the state in criminal cases. Prosecutors typically work to prove that the defendant is guilty, while defense attorneys work to prove their client's innocence. Prosecutors also have a higher burden of proof, as they must prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.



4) Civil law refers to the branch of law that deals with disputes between individuals or organizations, rather than criminal offenses.Iam intrested in this branch as Civil lawyers covers a wide range of issues, including contract disputes, personal injury cases, and property disputes. I also want to take part in civil law as it is my  goal  to resolve the dispute and reach a fair settlement for both parties, rather than to punish the guilty party. In addition iam intrested in Civil law because I wish to resolve through negotiations or mediation,also through a trial in a civil court. Civil law is different from criminal law, which deals with offenses against the state and focuses on punishment and this is the intresting part I endure most.



5) I believe I will be a successful lawyer because of the skills that I have . First and foremost, I am  able able to communicate effectively, both verbally and in writing. This includes me being able to argue a case persuasively, as well as draft clear and concise documents such as contracts and briefs. Another key skill that I have is critical thinking and problem-solving, as lawyer I must be able to analyze complex legal issues and find creative solutions. Additionally, I  a have strong research skills to be able to find relevant case law and other legal information to support their arguments. Finally, Ia have strong interpersonal skills to work well with clients. With all this I think I will be a successful Lawyer in the future
23/1/24, 2:27 PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Afternoon Mr. and Mrs. Patricia!
I hope you are doing well. Thank you for sending the responses to the documents. I have taken complete note of it and will update them in our records as well. We have our session right now. May I know if you are ready for the session?
23/1/24, 2:32 PM - +263 77 116 6703: Afternoon Sir.I hope you are well also.you can go ahead
23/1/24, 2:41 PM - Dev Edoofa: With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey.

Before we proceed to the next stage, I'd like to assist you in getting started with your EWYL Journey. Based on your EWYL application form, you are scheduled to commence your EWYL journey today (23rd January 2024). <This message was edited>
23/1/24, 2:41 PM - Dev Edoofa: With your intention and commencement date in mind, we have already communicated this information to the EWYL team. They are prepared to initiate your EWYL program today, as previously agreed upon.

To kick start the process, your dedicated EWYL Mentor has established your EWYL Group and shared the invitation link with us. Here's what you and your parents/guardian/sponsor need to do:
23/1/24, 2:42 PM - Dev Edoofa: https://chat.whatsapp.com/FS1dZVvFGLyIVJMetV4qR2

"Use the above-provided link to join your group. Once both you and your parents have joined, please send the following message to the group:

*Dear Mentor, my name is Patricia Tanatswa Mudzuri, and my EWYL group name is Patricia EWYL23E1187. I am excited to begin my EWYL Journey. As discussed with the admission team, I am committed to being available on 23/01/2024 to commence the procedures. Kindly schedule my session for the same date so that I can maximize the benefits and start on the right track.*"
23/1/24, 2:42 PM - Dev Edoofa: Once you start with the EWYL Program and are able to connect with your mentor, please update the same here as well by sending the below message -

*Hello Admission officer, I am now in touch with my EWYL Mentor. The name of my Mentor is _________ and he/she has scheduled my session for ________*(mention the date)
23/1/24, 3:57 PM - Dev Edoofa: I hope you are clear with this?
23/1/24, 4:19 PM - +263 78 322 2565: Hello Admission officer, I am now in touch with my EWYL Mentor. The name of my Mentor is Ms Adit and she has scheduled my session for 23/01/2024
24/1/24, 3:21 PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Patricia!
I hope you are doing well. I am glad to hear that you have initiated your EWY;L session.I wish you all the best for the same. We have our session right now. May I know if you are available for our conversation?
24/1/24, 3:51 PM - +263 78 322 2565: yes sir iam avialable
24/1/24, 3:54 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that!
24/1/24, 3:55 PM - Dev Edoofa: With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey. we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*.
24/1/24, 3:57 PM - Dev Edoofa: But before that. To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is BA LLB and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2025. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
24/1/24, 4:08 PM - +263 78 322 2565: The information i very accurate sir
24/1/24, 4:49 PM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. Based on our experience of over 14 years and having assisted over 5000 students from different countries, we have realized that financial planning is the most important factor when a student plans for his/her higher education abroad.
24/1/24, 4:49 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am sure that you must be aware that 20-30% of students who are admitted into universities abroad are unable to fulfill their dream and come to India due to a lack of financial planning. The funds needed for booking flights, accommodation, and covering living expenses after arrival often become overwhelming, leading to the decision to defer their admission for a year. This, in turn, creates a gap in the child's education.
24/1/24, 4:49 PM - Dev Edoofa: To assist both students and parents in this regard, Edoofa Management has designed a Financial Secure Plan that aims to help you prepare for your higher educational finances without experiencing stress or last-minute rushes. I believe you must be wondering about the details of the same plan and how it helps the parents?
24/1/24, 6:26 PM - +263 78 322 2565: Yes sir I wonder
24/1/24, 6:33 PM - Dev Edoofa: Let me help you here @263783222565 The *Edoofa Financial Secure Plan* is important for parents who have children joining the university for tertiary education in the next one to two years for several reasons:
24/1/24, 6:33 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Financial Preparedness:* The Edoofa Secure plan helps parents prepare financially for the costs after the Scholarship being offered so that they are not caught off guard.

*Reduced Financial Stress:* Having the Edoofa Secure Plan in place can significantly reduce the financial stress on you as parents when your child is about to enter university. Knowing that there is a dedicated fund for education expenses provides peace of mind.
24/1/24, 6:33 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Avoiding Debt*: Without proper savings, some parents may resort to taking out loans or accumulating credit card debt to cover their child's education costs. This Educational savings plan helps avoid the burden of debt and high-interest payments.

*Compound Interest:* By starting to save early and consistently contributing to the savings plan, parents can take advantage of compound interest, which can significantly increase the amount available for education expenses.
24/1/24, 6:33 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Flexibility and Control:* The Edoofa Secure savings plans allow parents to have greater control over their finances and how they allocate funds for their child's education. They can choose investment options that align with their risk tolerance and financial goals.

*Encouraging Responsibility*: Involving your child in the process of saving for their education teaches them financial responsibility and the value of higher education. It also motivates them to outperform in Academics.
24/1/24, 6:33 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Adapting to Unexpected Changes*: Life is full of surprises, and circumstances can change especially when there are political reforms changing each day impacting the Local Currency. Having an Edoofa Secure Plan allows parents to adapt to unexpected changes in their financial situation while still prioritizing their child's education.

*Peace of Mind:* Overall, having the Edoofa Secure plan provides parents with peace of mind, knowing that they are actively planning for their child's future and increasing the likelihood of providing them with a solid education.
24/1/24, 6:33 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, when you go through all the above benefits, I am sure you can see that the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan is an important financial tool for parents/students who are supposed to enter the university soon. 

It helps ensure that the financial aspect of tertiary education is well-managed, reduces stress, and allows parents to provide the best opportunities for their children without resorting to debt or financial hardship. Isn't this something you and your family also wish to have?
24/1/24, 6:37 PM - +263 78 322 2565: Yes sir it will be helpful enough to avoid certain circumstances and to be prepared in times of emegency
24/1/24, 6:37 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through the above points, do you want me to help you understand how the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan works?
24/1/24, 6:38 PM - +263 78 322 2565: Yes sir 😊
24/1/24, 6:39 PM - Dev Edoofa: Let me help you here. As you are aware, we are currently in January 2024, and we have a good 20 months to plan for your finances before you start your university education in 2025.
24/1/24, 6:40 PM - Dev Edoofa: During the counseling session, you were informed that at Edoofa, we guarantee a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship on the tuition fees. Hence, the cost of education, including food and accommodation after the scholarship, would be between $2000-$3000, and it could be even less. Not more than that.
24/1/24, 6:40 PM - Dev Edoofa: This means that if you can save $150 per month for the next 20 months, you will be able to save $3000. This amount is more than enough for the first year of university fees, including tuition fees (if any), food, and accommodation. I hope you agree with this?
24/1/24, 6:45 PM - +263 78 322 2565: Yes sir we are on the same page
24/1/24, 6:51 PM - Dev Edoofa: Right @263783222565, this means that by the time you would be in India, you would have already saved the $3000 that will cover the first-year fee.
24/1/24, 6:51 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, in these next 20 months, I am sure you would also be engaged in the EWYL program, and if you secure a minimum of $1000 in 20 months, that means the fees for 1.5 years are already secured.
24/1/24, 6:51 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, for a 3-year course, if we follow the same approach for the remaining 1.5 years, the educational journey for the student and the financial journey for the parent will be easy and smooth. I believe you must be able to see this perspective?
24/1/24, 6:54 PM - +263 78 322 2565: Yes sir
24/1/24, 6:55 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. With that said, there is also another benefit, I am sure being in Zimbabwe you know how drastically the exchange rate fluctuates.
24/1/24, 6:55 PM - Dev Edoofa: If you are buying a dollar today, you might be spending 7000 bonds, but if you buy a dollar after a month, the rate would be different.
24/1/24, 6:55 PM - Dev Edoofa: Also, even if you choose to buy dollars every month and save at your home, it is not safe since there is news of robbery, and mugging every day.
24/1/24, 6:55 PM - Dev Edoofa: In that case, you will opt to save in the Bank, but again we know that savings in the Bank require a Nostro Account which means you have to pay the bank to keep your money safe, right?
24/1/24, 6:57 PM - +263 78 322 2565: Yes sir correct✅
24/1/24, 6:58 PM - Dev Edoofa: Hence, @263783222565, considering these constraints, Edoofa Management has decided to help the parents and students prepare for the journey way ahead of time by helping them save money with Edoofa without any additional charges but rather saving additional money as well. Do you want me to explain how this has been achieved?
24/1/24, 6:59 PM - +263 78 322 2565: Yes Sir
24/1/24, 7:04 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Program Fee (Enrollment Fee) that you were asked to pay is $350. <This message was edited>
24/1/24, 7:05 PM - Dev Edoofa: Under the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan, a parent has to deposit a small amount of money which is $150 every month for the next 10 months. 

That means, in 10 months, the money saved will be $1500. When this money is saved, Edoofa will waive off the remaining $150 which was due from the Edoofa Program/Enrollment Fee of $350, thereby making a straight saving of $150 in 10 months.
24/1/24, 7:05 PM - Dev Edoofa: Imagine you paying $15 every month to the Bank of Zimbabwe to keep your money safe, and here Edoofa is paying you $15 every month to keep your money safe. Now, you must be wondering, why only for 10 months and not for 20 months, right?
24/1/24, 7:06 PM - +263 78 322 2565: yes sir
24/1/24, 7:08 PM - Dev Edoofa: @263783222565 if you see the bigger picture, you will realize that the reason is quite simple. Upon the completion of the 10 installments, the Edoofa Admissions team will initiate the Child’s Admission Process by applying early to the universities to secure their scholarship and their university seat.
24/1/24, 7:08 PM - Dev Edoofa: Reserving seats earlier increases the chances of obtaining a maximum scholarship. A higher scholarship means lower fees, and by securing the seat, you will be entitled to pay the fees as per the old fee structure of the university, not the new one implemented in January 2025. Furthermore, when applying to the universities, you will receive an offer letter or a letter of intent detailing the fees, scholarship, and registration fees.
24/1/24, 7:08 PM - Dev Edoofa: As explained during the enrollment process, the registration fee is a portion of your first-year university fee, paid to reserve the seat. It ranges from $500-$1000 and is not an additional fee. 

From the $1500 you saved with Edoofa, the registration fee will be paid to the university, securing the seat. For instance, if the registration fee is $1000, Edoofa will pay $1000 from the $1500 saved in 10 months. The updated balance with Edoofa will be $500, which will be paid to the university upon your arrival in India.
24/1/24, 7:08 PM - Dev Edoofa: This eases the financial burden on the parent, as there is no immediate payment required upon the student's arrival. The $500 saved will cover the remaining fees for the semester/year, as specified in the offer letter from the university. What are your thoughts on this?
24/1/24, 7:13 PM - +263 78 322 2565: I think this is a good idea because paying these whole figures at one goal is a bit complex
24/1/24, 7:13 PM - Dev Edoofa: Absolutely @263783222565 I am glad to see that we are together so far. With this plan for the next 10 months, I am sure you must be wondering what will happen in the next 10 months, considering you have already secured your scholarship seat with the university due to your hard work in the first 10 months. Is my understanding correct?
24/1/24, 7:17 PM - +263 78 322 2565: Yes sir
24/1/24, 7:21 PM - Dev Edoofa: Let me help you with that as well. In the 11th month, you will be guided to open an FBC Mastercard bank account in Zimbabwe with a deposit of $150. The reason for this is that when you apply for your student Visa, the Embassy asks for a Bank Statement, and this account will serve that purpose.
24/1/24, 7:21 PM - Dev Edoofa: We understand it might be expensive if you deposit another $1500 for the remaining 10 months in FBC Bank Zimbabwe, so to avoid the same challenges, we have designed the plan accordingly. You will only be depositing for the 11th, 12th, 13th, and 14th month, which is 4 months.
24/1/24, 7:21 PM - Dev Edoofa: Once the 4 months are completed, our Department of Student Welfare (DSW) team will assist you with your visa process. The bank statement will act as one of the required documents, and once you receive the visa, you can withdraw the amount from FBC and book the flight ticket. This will help you utilize the money as well. How does it sound?
24/1/24, 7:23 PM - +263 78 322 2565: Sounds great
24/1/24, 7:25 PM - Dev Edoofa: Amazing. Now, from the 16th Month till the 20th month, considering it is a 6-month window, you can again continue depositing the money ($150) with Edoofa which can be used in the fee as and when required or you can decide to save this $900 of these 6 months with you as well. This is something which you are free to choose. I hope you have understood the financial secure plan now?
24/1/24, 7:28 PM - +263 78 322 2565: Yes sir i understand
24/1/24, 7:29 PM - Dev Edoofa: That's great. Now that you have all the information, I want you to take some time and discuss the financial security plan with your family members. Help them understand its importance and details. Once you're done, we can reconnect, have a discussion, and address any queries you may have. After resolving your concerns, I'll guide you through starting your financial security plan. 

While most students can discuss this with their parents the same day, I understand everyone is different. Could you let me know when you think you'll have the discussion with your parents? This way, we can schedule our next session accordingly.
24/1/24, 7:30 PM - +263 78 322 2565: Okay sir thank you very much
24/1/24, 7:37 PM - Dev Edoofa: Yes, @263783222565 Hence, may I know by when will you be able to have a discussion with your family so that we can schedule our session accordingly?
24/1/24, 7:45 PM - +263 78 322 2565: Okay sir once my mother come online she will get to know about all of this I think about an our or so
26/1/24, 9:42 AM - Dev Edoofa: I hope you are doing well and are having a wonderful start to the day. I felt a bit under the weather yesterday, so I took a day off to focus on my health. Today, I am feeling better and completely ready to take our conversation forward. We will have our session at 3:00 PM to take forward our conversation. I hope by that time you will have discussed the Edoofa Secure Plan with your family. <This message was edited>

26/1/24, 3:11 PM - +263 78 322 2565: Good Afternoon
26/1/24, 3:15 PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Patricia!
I hope you are doing well and are having a great day.
26/1/24, 3:32 PM - Dev Edoofa: Regarding the discussion we had the other day about the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan, I wanted to follow up on our last conversation. Have you, as a family, been able to discuss it? If so, I would like to understand how the discussion went. What were their thoughts about it? Did they have any specific queries or concerns that you would like us to address?
26/1/24, 3:49 PM - +263 78 322 2565: Yes sir we discussed about the Financial Secure Plan and my family members seemed to like and thinks that is a good idea . But the question now is that how would we know that our money is safe.Is there any proof or anything so that we believe that there will be no any fraud that will take place
26/1/24, 3:52 PM - Dev Edoofa: @263783222565 , Edoofa has been working in this field of education for the past 15 years and has been providing Quality higher education at an affordable cost to more than 5000+ students. We are determined to not only help students plan their higher education but also help them plan their finances for further education. The Edoofa Secure Plan is designed to help students and their families prepare the finances for higher education here in India. As mentioned above, 20-30% of students who enroll in our program are not able to come to India, due to insufficient planning of finances. To tackle this situation, the Edoofa Secure Plan was introduced.
26/1/24, 3:52 PM - Dev Edoofa: I can completely understand your concern about scams happening all around and just like you other students and parents may also have had the same concerns in the past. But if you look at our journey, you will realize that Edoofa is one of the only genuine organizations that is helping students pursue their education and making students employable.
26/1/24, 3:55 PM - Dev Edoofa: Edoofa uses legitimate payment gateways of money transfer for example banks and at the same time, scammers use ways like bitcoins and other unreliable gateways. Also, whenever you pay it will be through banks or our associates, it will be reflected in the records of the banks and this will help you keep track of the payments from your side. Moreover, there is also going to be an agreement stating the legitimitacy of this program. I hope you understand what I am trying to convey?
26/1/24, 4:20 PM - +263 78 322 2565: I understand sir
26/1/24, 4:29 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that! Are there any more queries that you want to ask?
26/1/24, 4:32 PM - +263 78 322 2565: No sir we can proceed
26/1/24, 4:36 PM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know, Patricia. For the current round of students, there are only 27 seats available for the students who can benefit from the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan. 

Since you have been one of the most dedicated students, and I see you have great aspirations, I wanted you to be a part of the same set of students and start with your future planning the right way.
26/1/24, 4:36 PM - Dev Edoofa: Also, as this plan commences from the month of January, for the efficient implementation of this plan, we need to decide on a fixed date on which you will deposit $150 every month. This will provide you with the flexibility to align your finances accordingly.
26/1/24, 4:36 PM - Dev Edoofa: Our complete focus is on providing students and parents with the best ways to avail themselves of these opportunities. We understand that every parent may not be able to make the payment on our specified date. Therefore, considering this situation, we allow them to decide the payment date according to their comfort. In light of the same, may I know the fixed date every month on which you will deposit $150?
26/1/24, 4:41 PM - +263 78 322 2565: Okay sir I will definetly answer that after my father decides which date he is comfort to pay
26/1/24, 8:23 PM - Dev Edoofa: That's perfectly fine. In that case, we will conclude today's conversation, and I will connect with you tomorrow to resume our discussion. In the meantime, I hope you'll have a detailed discussion with your family and jot down any questions or thoughts you have regarding the Financial Secure plan.

Wishing you a good night, and please extend our regards to your family.
