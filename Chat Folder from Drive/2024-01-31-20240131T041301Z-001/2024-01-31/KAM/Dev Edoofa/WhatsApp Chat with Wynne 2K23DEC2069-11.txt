2/1/24, 2:22 PM - Dev Edoofa: Amazing, Moving forward in our today’s session, we will discuss a bit about your university admission journey. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts, I will explain to you it in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them.

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
2/1/24, 2:23 PM - +263 71 401 8032: Ooh okay okay sir  . I am ready sir
2/1/24, 2:24 PM - Dev Edoofa: <Media omitted>
2/1/24, 2:26 PM - +263 71 401 8032: I am done sir. Thank you
2/1/24, 2:27 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
2/1/24, 2:27 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
2/1/24, 2:30 PM - +263 71 401 8032: They are very clear sir . Thank you for the explanation
2/1/24, 2:31 PM - Dev Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
2/1/24, 2:31 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
2/1/24, 2:33 PM - +263 71 401 8032: I am following sir. This is understandable
2/1/24, 2:36 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
2/1/24, 2:36 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
2/1/24, 2:39 PM - +263 71 401 8032: This is pretty clear sir. Thank you
2/1/24, 2:41 PM - Dev Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
2/1/24, 2:41 PM - +263 71 401 8032: Ooh okay okay sir . We can start
2/1/24, 2:42 PM - Dev Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
2/1/24, 2:42 PM - Dev Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding you are ready, shall we start with our discussion with me individually? 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
2/1/24, 2:44 PM - +263 71 401 8032: Yes yes I am ready sir
2/1/24, 2:45 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students*

3/1/24, 4:15 PM - +263 71 401 8032: 2) To be an aerospace engineer, one need to have a combination of technical, analytical, and creative skills. Some of the most important skills for aerospace engineering include

- **Mathematics**: One need to have mathematics skills to perform calculations and apply formulas related to aircraft and spacecraft design, performance, and structures. You also need to be familiar with advanced topics such as calculus, linear algebra, differential equations, and statistics.
- **Physics**:One need to have an amazing understanding of physics to analyze the forces, motions, and energies involved in aerospace engineering. You also need to know the principles of aerodynamics, thermodynamics, fluid dynamics, and mechanics.
- **Engineering**: One need to have the ability to engineer or design aircraft, spacecraft, missiles, or other aerospace products and systems. One also need to be able to use engineering tools and software to create models, simulations, and analyses of your designs.
- **Problem-solving**: One need to have the ability to problem-solve and troubleshoot engineering issues that may arise during the design, development, testing, or operation of aerospace products and systems. You also need to be able to find innovative solutions to complex challenges.
- **Creativity**: One need to have the ability to think creatively and innovatively to design and develop new and improved aerospace products and systems. One also need to be able to adapt to changing requirements and technologies in the field.

These are some of the main skills for aerospace engineering, but there are also other skills that may be useful, such as communication, teamwork, project management, and safety.
3/1/24, 4:17 PM - +263 71 401 8032: 3) Aerodynamics is an important concept in the aerospace engineering field. Aerospace engineers use principles of aerodynamics to design aircraft, spacecraft, and other vehicles that can travel through the air or space. They use computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations to model the airflow around the vehicle and optimize its shape to reduce drag (opposing forces which delay ), increase lift, and improve performance . The aerodynamic performance, such as the lift and drag, of a body is governed by the flow of air across its surface. Applied aerodynamics seeks to understand and utilize the fundamental aspects of this fluid flow in the analysis, design, and integration of aerodynamic geometries . Engineers utilize aerodynamic principles to enhance fuel efficiency, improve stability, and minimize drag .
3/1/24, 4:21 PM - +263 71 401 8032: 4)  Lift augmentation devices are components or mechanisms that increase the amount of lift produced by the wing at low speeds, such as during takeoff(leaving) and landing. They can be classified into two main types: trailing-edge devices and leading-edge devices.

Trailing-edge devices are located on the rear part of the wing and they change the shape and area of the wing when deployed. The most common trailing-edge device is the flap, which can be lowered to increase the camber and chord of the wing, resulting in more lift and drag. There are different types of flaps, such as plainand Fowler flaps, each with different advantages and disadvantages.

Leading-edge devices are located on the front part of the wing and they modify the airflow over the wing when extended. The most common leading-edge device is the slat, which is a small movable surface that creates a gap between itself and the wing, allowing more air to flow over the upper surface of the wing and delaying the stall. Slats can be fixed or retractable, and they can also be combined with flaps to create a powerful high-lift system. Another leading-edge device is the slot, which is a fixed gap that also improves the airflow over the wing and increases the stall angle.

These are some of the lift augmentation devices used in an aircraft .
3/1/24, 4:24 PM - +263 71 401 8032: 5)Aviation is a broad field that encompasses many diverse topics and activities related to mechanical flight and the aircraft industrialization. Some of the main areas in aviation include

- **Aircraft design and engineering**: This area involves the creation and development of aircraft, spacecraft, missiles, and other flying vehicles and systems. It requires skills in mathematics, physics, engineering, and problem-solving. Some of the subfields in this area are aerodynamics, propulsion, structures, materials, and control systems.

- **Aircraft operation and maintenance**: This area involves the piloting and servicing of aircraft and their components. It requires skills in flight training, navigation, communication, and safety. Some of the subfields in this area are flight instruction, air traffic control, aircraft mechanic, and avionics technician .
- **Aircraft management and organization**: This area involves the planning and coordination of aviation activities and resources. It requires skills in business, economics, law, and leadership. Some of the subfields in this area are airline management, airport management, aviation consulting, and aviation regulation .

These are some of the main areas in aviation, but there are also other areas that are related to aviation, such as aviation history, aviation research, and aviation journalism.

5/1/24, 11:40 AM - Dev Edoofa: Hello Wynne and Parents!
Shall we start with our session?
5/1/24, 12:37 PM - +263 71 401 8032: Yes yes sir we can
5/1/24, 12:37 PM - +263 71 401 8032: How are you doing sir
5/1/24, 12:39 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am doing well. Thank you so much for asking.
5/1/24, 12:40 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that!
5/1/24, 12:41 PM - +263 71 401 8032: Oooh amazing sir
5/1/24, 12:41 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey. we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*.
5/1/24, 12:42 PM - +263 71 401 8032: Oooh okay okay sir
5/1/24, 12:42 PM - +263 71 401 8032: Thank you thank you
5/1/24, 1:04 PM - +263 71 401 8032: I am ready for the session sir.
5/1/24, 1:07 PM - Dev Edoofa: Yes, Wynne. There was a technical glitch which led to the delay. I hope you understand.
5/1/24, 1:07 PM - Dev Edoofa: We can now move ahead!
5/1/24, 1:07 PM - +263 71 401 8032: I do understand sir
5/1/24, 1:08 PM - +263 71 401 8032: Oooh okay okay sir
5/1/24, 1:09 PM - Dev Edoofa: Great!
5/1/24, 1:10 PM - Dev Edoofa: However, before we do the same, I was going through your scholarship application file and noticed that you are supposed to make the payment of your remaining part of Edoofa Enrollment fee. Hence, I thought of sharing a gentle reminder with you and trying to understand how your preparation has been so far? Have you been able to align your preparations in the right direction?
5/1/24, 1:12 PM - +263 71 401 8032: Oooh that yes my parents are working on it. They are preparing sir they will definitely do something about it . Thank you for the reminder sir
5/1/24, 1:13 PM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. We will reconnect with each other a few days before your due date to take a follow up on this and understand your preparations better,
5/1/24, 1:13 PM - Dev Edoofa: In the meantime. Let us move forward with our discussion. To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is  B.Tech (Aerospace Engineering) and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2025. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
5/1/24, 1:14 PM - +263 71 401 8032: Ooh I see sir. Thank you very much
5/1/24, 1:14 PM - +263 71 401 8032: Yes yes it is very accurate sir <This message was edited>
5/1/24, 1:20 PM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. Based on our experience of over 14 years and having assisted over 5000 students from different countries, we have realized that financial planning is the most important factor when a student plans for his/her higher education abroad.
5/1/24, 1:20 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am sure that you must be aware that 20-30% of students who are admitted into universities abroad are unable to fulfill their dream and come to India due to a lack of financial planning. The funds needed for booking flights, accommodation, and covering living expenses after arrival often become overwhelming, leading to the decision to defer their admission for a year. This, in turn, creates a gap in the child's education.
5/1/24, 1:20 PM - Dev Edoofa: To assist both students and parents in this regard, Edoofa Management has designed a Financial Secure Plan that aims to help you prepare for your higher educational finances without experiencing stress or last-minute rushes. I believe you must be wondering about the details of the same plan and how it helps the parents?
5/1/24, 1:23 PM - +263 71 401 8032: Yes sir. I am wondering can you help me please
5/1/24, 1:26 PM - Dev Edoofa: Edoofa Secure Plan is important for parents who have children joining the university for tertiary education in the next one to two years for several reasons:
5/1/24, 1:26 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Financial Preparedness:* The Edoofa Secure plan helps parents prepare financially for the costs after the Scholarship being offered so that they are not caught off guard.

*Reduced Financial Stress:* Having the Edoofa Secure Plan in place can significantly reduce the financial stress on you as parents when your child is about to enter university. Knowing that there is a dedicated fund for education expenses provides peace of mind.
5/1/24, 1:26 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Avoiding Debt*: Without proper savings, some parents may resort to taking out loans or accumulating credit card debt to cover their child's education costs. This Educational savings plan helps avoid the burden of debt and high-interest payments.

*Compound Interest:* By starting to save early and consistently contributing to the savings plan, parents can take advantage of compound interest, which can significantly increase the amount available for education expenses.
5/1/24, 1:26 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Flexibility and Control:* The Edoofa Secure savings plans allow parents to have greater control over their finances and how they allocate funds for their child's education. They can choose investment options that align with their risk tolerance and financial goals.

*Encouraging Responsibility*: Involving your child in the process of saving for their education teaches them financial responsibility and the value of higher education. It also motivates them to outperform in Academics.
5/1/24, 1:26 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Adapting to Unexpected Changes*: Life is full of surprises, and circumstances can change especially when there are political reforms changing each day impacting the Local Currency. Having an Edoofa Secure Plan allows parents to adapt to unexpected changes in their financial situation while still prioritizing their child's education.

*Peace of Mind:* Overall, having the Edoofa Secure plan provides parents with peace of mind, knowing that they are actively planning for their child's future and increasing the likelihood of providing them with a solid education
5/1/24, 1:27 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, when you go through all the above benefits, I am sure you can see that the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan is an important financial tool for parents/students who are supposed to enter the university soon. 

It helps ensure that the financial aspect of tertiary education is well-managed, reduces stress, and allows parents to provide the best opportunities for their children without resorting to debt or financial hardship. Isn't this something you and your family also wish to have?
5/1/24, 1:33 PM - +263 71 401 8032: This is exactly we wish to have sir . This is amazing. I like it sir
5/1/24, 1:40 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through the above points, do you want me to help you understand how the Edoofa Secure Plan works?
5/1/24, 1:40 PM - +263 71 401 8032: Yes yes sir
5/1/24, 1:58 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, as you are aware, we are currently in January 2024, and we have a good 20-21 months to plan for your finances before you start your university education in 2025.
5/1/24, 1:58 PM - Dev Edoofa: During the counseling session, you were informed that at Edoofa, we guarantee a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship on the tuition fees. Hence, the cost of education, including food and accommodation after the scholarship, would be between $2700-$3700, and it could be even less. Not more than that.
5/1/24, 1:58 PM - Dev Edoofa: This means that if you can save $150 per month for the next 20 months, you will be able to save $3000. This amount is more than enough for the first year of university fees, including tuition fees (if any), food, and accommodation. I hope you agree with this?
5/1/24, 2:04 PM - +263 71 401 8032: Yaaah I do agree with this sir
5/1/24, 2:08 PM - Dev Edoofa: Right, this means that by the time you would be in India, you would have already saved the $3000 that will cover the first-year fee.
5/1/24, 2:08 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, in these next 20 months, I am sure you would also be engaged in the EWYL program, and if you secure a minimum of $1000 in 20 months, that means the fees for 1.5 years are already secured.
5/1/24, 2:08 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, for a 3-year course, if we follow the same approach for the remaining 1.5 years, the educational journey for the student and the financial journey for the parent will be easy and smooth. I believe you must be able to see this perspective?
5/1/24, 2:12 PM - +263 71 401 8032: Yaaah this is clear sir
5/1/24, 2:15 PM - Dev Edoofa: This message was deleted

5/1/24, 2:21 PM - Dev Edoofa: There was a technical glitch which led to this. I hope you understand.
5/1/24, 2:21 PM - +263 71 401 8032: I do understand sir.
5/1/24, 2:23 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. With that said, there is also another benefit of Edoofa Secure Plan, I am sure being in Zimbabwe you know how drastically the exchange rate fluctuates.
5/1/24, 2:23 PM - Dev Edoofa: If you are buying a dollar today, you might be spending 7000 bonds, but if you buy a dollar after a month, the rate would be different.
5/1/24, 2:23 PM - Dev Edoofa: Also, even if you choose to buy dollars every month and save at your home, it is not safe since there is news of robbery, and mugging every day.
5/1/24, 2:23 PM - Dev Edoofa: In that case, you will opt to save in the Bank, but again we know that savings in the Bank require a Nostro Account which means you have to pay the bank to keep your money safe, right?
5/1/24, 2:25 PM - +263 71 401 8032: Exactly that's happening here
5/1/24, 2:26 PM - +263 71 401 8032: Yes yes that is it sir
5/1/24, 2:37 PM - Dev Edoofa: Considering these constraints, Edoofa Management has decided to help the parents and students prepare for the journey way ahead of time by helping them save money with Edoofa without any additional charges but rather saving additional money as well. Do you want me to explain how this has been achieved?
5/1/24, 2:39 PM - +263 71 401 8032: Yes yes sir.
5/1/24, 2:42 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Program Fee (Enrollment Fee) that you were asked to pay is $350. From the $350, you have already paid $200, and the remaining $150 is what you are planning to pay by tomorrow before your due date of 21-January-2024
5/1/24, 2:42 PM - Dev Edoofa: Under the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan, a parent has to deposit a small amount of money which is $150 every month for the next 10 months. 

That means, in 10 months, the money saved will be $1500. When this money is saved, Edoofa will waive off the remaining $150 which was due from the Edoofa Program/Enrollment Fee of $350, thereby making a straight saving of $150 in 10 months.
5/1/24, 2:42 PM - Dev Edoofa: Imagine you paying $15 every month to the Bank of Zimbabwe to keep your money safe, and here Edoofa is paying you $15 every month to keep your money safe. Now, you must be wondering, why only for 10 months and not for 20 months, right?
5/1/24, 2:49 PM - +263 71 401 8032: Mmm sir you mean $150 right
5/1/24, 2:49 PM - +263 71 401 8032: Yes yes why for 10 months
5/1/24, 2:52 PM - Dev Edoofa: If you see the bigger picture, you will realize that the reason is quite simple. Upon the completion of the 10 installments, the Edoofa Admissions team will initiate the Child’s Admission Process by applying early to the universities to secure their scholarship and their university seat.
5/1/24, 2:52 PM - Dev Edoofa: Reserving seats earlier increases the chances of obtaining a maximum scholarship. A higher scholarship means lower fees, and by securing the seat, you will be entitled to pay the fees as per the old fee structure of the university, not the new one implemented in January 2025. Furthermore, when applying to the universities, you will receive an offer letter or a letter of intent detailing the fees, scholarship, and registration fee.
5/1/24, 2:52 PM - Dev Edoofa: As explained during the enrollment process, the registration fee is a portion of your first-year university fee, paid to reserve the seat. It ranges from $500-$1000 and is not an additional fee. 

From the $1500 you saved with Edoofa, the registration fee will be paid to the university, securing the seat. For instance, if the registration fee is $1000, Edoofa will pay $1000 from the $1500 saved in 10 months. The updated balance with Edoofa will be $500, which will be paid to the university upon your arrival in India.
5/1/24, 2:52 PM - Dev Edoofa: This eases the financial burden on the parent, as there is no immediate payment required upon the student's arrival. The $500 saved will cover the remaining fees for the semester/year, as specified in the offer letter from the university. What are your thoughts on this?
5/1/24, 2:57 PM - +263 71 401 8032: I think this is any amazing Idea sir. It sounds great.
5/1/24, 3:18 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to see that we are together so far. With this plan for the next 10 months, I am sure you must be wondering what will happen in the next 10 months, considering you have already secured your scholarship seat with the university due to your hard work in the first 10 months. Is my understanding correct?
5/1/24, 3:21 PM - +263 71 401 8032: Yes yes you are very correct. What will happen after those 10 months
5/1/24, 3:29 PM - Dev Edoofa: Let me help you with that as well. In the 11th month, you will be guided to open an FBC Mastercard bank account in Zimbabwe with a deposit of $150. The reason for this is that when you apply for your student Visa, the Embassy asks for a Bank Statement, and this account will serve that purpose.
5/1/24, 3:29 PM - Dev Edoofa: We understand it might be expensive if you deposit another $1500 for the remaining 10 months in FB  Bank Zimbabwe, so to avoid the same challenges, we have designed the plan accordingly. You will only be depositing for the 11th, 12th, 13th, and 14th month, which is 4 months.
5/1/24, 3:29 PM - Dev Edoofa: Once the 4 months are completed, our Department of Student Welfare (DSW) team will assist you with your visa process. The bank statement will act as one of the required documents, and once you receive the visa, you can withdraw the amount from FBC and book the flight ticket. This will help you utilize the money as well. How does it sound?
5/1/24, 3:41 PM - +263 71 401 8032: Yaaah this sounds great sir. It a great plan
5/1/24, 3:42 PM - +263 71 401 8032: Edoofa did very well in planning this I must say
5/1/24, 3:45 PM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you so much. We appreciate your compliment.
5/1/24, 3:45 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, from the 16th Month till the 20th month, considering it is a 6-month window, you can again continue depositing the money ($150) with Edoofa which can be used in the fee as and when required or you can decide to save this $900 of these 6 months with you as well. This is something which you are free to choose. I hope you have understood the financial secure plan now?
5/1/24, 3:49 PM - +263 71 401 8032: Yes yes sir . It is understandable but I have this one question sir
5/1/24, 3:50 PM - +263 71 401 8032: Sir this $150 dollars we will be depositing every month for 10 months is possible to work for it in the EWYL programme or it can only be paid by my parents
5/1/24, 4:08 PM - Dev Edoofa: Wynne, the Financial Secure Plan is planned with respect to the EWYL program. The basic agenda behind this plan is to prepare you and your parents for the finances of your higher eductaion here in India. Along with the EWYL program, let me explain it to you in a better way:
5/1/24, 4:09 PM - +263 71 401 8032: Oooh okay okay sir thank you thank you
5/1/24, 4:12 PM - Dev Edoofa: Consider, your yearly fees for higher education is $3000. Now, EWYL program may help you prepare for the finances of 1 year. But in the long run or over the further years, you may not be able to prepare . That is why, we came up with the Financial Secure Plan. This plan will prepare you better with overall finances of your higher education.
5/1/24, 4:13 PM - Dev Edoofa: I hope I was able to make you understand!
5/1/24, 4:14 PM - +263 71 401 8032: Yes yes now it's clear sir. Thank you thank you for the explanation
5/1/24, 5:23 PM - +263 71 401 8032: This message was deleted
5/1/24, 5:24 PM - +263 71 401 8032: *Hello Admission officer, I am now in touch with my EWYL Mentor. The name of my Mentor is ___Ms Ananya______ and he/she has scheduled my session for ___11 January 2024_____*(mention the date)
6/1/24, 8:51 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that!
6/1/24, 9:46 AM - +263 71 401 8032: Thank you thank you sir. How are you doing sir
7/1/24, 8:30 AM - Dev Edoofa: Good Morning Wynne! I am doing well and hope the same for you as well.
Since it is a Sunday, we will reconnect and continue our session on Monday at 1 pm.
7/1/24, 2:22 PM - +263 71 401 8032: Oooh okay okay thank you sir
7/1/24, 4:30 PM - +263 77 388 8622: Good afternoon Mr Dev Kumar.
As Wynne's parent/ father, l am kindly asking you to have the sessions with Wynne as from 3:30 pm onwards, he will be now at home by this time. All the other times before 3:30pm he will be at school and the school does not allow students to have phones at school.
8/1/24, 3:43 PM - +263 71 401 8032: Good afternoon sir
9/1/24, 10:00 AM - Dev Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Wynne!
I hope all of you are doing great. While I was wrapping up my day yesterday, I observed that we were not able to have a smooth discussion for the past couple of days, which has led to some delay in the admission process. We are aware of your immense trust in us and we surely care about your future. Considering that in mind, I wanted to schedule a specific session today at 2:30 pm so that we can cover the process we are lagging behind,  and ensure that your admission process is on track. <This message was edited>
9/1/24, 10:08 AM - +263 71 401 8032: Mmm okay okay sir. Thank you thank you sir

20/1/24, 8:43 AM - Dev Edoofa: Good Moning Parents and Wynne,

I hope you are doing well, and that this message finds you in the best of spirits. Please excuse me for not being able to connect with you in the past couple of days, I was a bit under the weather and had to take some time off to focus on my health. <This message was edited>
20/1/24, 8:43 AM - Dev Edoofa: During this period, I couldn't communicate about my unavailability. However, I am feeling much better today and am available to resume all operations.
20/1/24, 8:43 AM - Dev Edoofa: This message was deleted
20/1/24, 9:01 AM - Dev Edoofa: Additionally, since it has been a while since we last connected, I was wondering how you and your family are doing?
20/1/24, 9:24 AM - +263 77 388 8622: Ooooh very sorry for not feeling well. We are happy to hear that that you are now feeling much better. We pray for your complete healing. Here we are fine. Unfortunately Wynne is away on school trip and where he is there is a great problem of network. He will be able to connect with you on Monday afternoon when he is back from school trip.
Sorry for the inconveniences caused.
Meanwhile we are to pay the last payment for the registration balance $150. We are paying today through Mr Kawadza.
20/1/24, 9:36 AM - Dev Edoofa: First of all! Thank you for your wishes about my recovery, @263773888622, and for letting me know about Wynne's school trip. I have taken complete note of it and hope that he has a safe trip. 
Also, I have taken note of the bout the payment of the remaining enrollment fees. Please share the receipt of the payment whenever you are done with
20/1/24, 9:38 AM - Dev Edoofa: Secondly, I believe parents should take active participation in these processes when their child is unavailable to keep the admission process on track. I hope that you are going to participate in our discussion today?
20/1/24, 10:15 AM - +263 77 388 8622: USD169 sent to SHORWI KAWADZA Approval Code: PP240120.1014.G91692. New wallet balance: USD 19.96.
20/1/24, 10:23 AM - +263 77 388 8622: This is the last balance payment for Wynne for the registration. We have paid through Mr Shorwi Kawadza' s ecocash number. This includes the 12.5% transaction charges.
As Wynne's parents we are happy about all the processes taking place and hoping that next year Wynne will make it at one of India's universities.
20/1/24, 10:24 AM - +263 77 388 8622: I am available for the participation at anytime of the day.
20/1/24, 10:30 AM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the payment message! I have taken note of it and will update it with our accounts team as well.
20/1/24, 10:34 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that! Coming back to Wynne's admission process, regarding the discussion we had the other day about the financial security plan, if I am correct, you mentioned that your family is looking forward to starting with the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan. May I know if you discussed it with your family in detail?
20/1/24, 10:41 AM - +263 77 388 8622: Today l am going to meet my wife and other family members and will have a full face to face discussion with them and in detail then will give you feedback as well. But as l see it it's just a formality nothing will stop us to progress.
20/1/24, 10:46 AM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for informing me. I have taken note of it as well. May I know if you are available to discuss the further process or would you like to first discuss the Edoofa Secure Plan with your family, and then move ahead?
20/1/24, 10:51 AM - +263 77 388 8622: I am available
20/1/24, 10:54 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that! May I know what are your thoughts on the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan? It will help us to get a better understanding of how you feel about it.
20/1/24, 11:03 AM - +263 77 388 8622: This is a good idea in that it prepares and secures finances or fees for the student. This will easy the problem of running around looking for large amounts of fees at once. One might not have the money at hand by the time it is needed. If one engages in this financial secure plan, one might not have problems in paying this money. So it's a good idea for one to engage in this program.
20/1/24, 11:16 AM - Dev Edoofa: Yes, certainly @263773888622! Thank you for sharing your thoughts about the Edoofa Secure Plan. I am glad that you were able to grasp and understand the beneficial aspects of the Edoofa Secure Plan.
20/1/24, 11:20 AM - Dev Edoofa: Now moving forward, to ensure the efficient implementation of this plan, we need to decide upon the month from which this plan is going to start and a fixed date on which you will positively deposit $150 every month. 

Our complete focus is on providing students and parents with the best ways to avail of these opportunities, We completely understand that every parent can't make the payment on our specified date. So considering this situation, we let them decide the plan initiation month and date according to their comfort. So, may I know from what month you wish to start this plan, as well as the fixed date of every month on which you will be able to deposit $150 every month?
20/1/24, 11:25 AM - +263 77 388 8622: So on this one can you kindly give me time so that l will discuss with family on how best can we do this. Right now as l have indicated l am still on my way going to where the family is.  If we can connect around 3:00 pm, l will then be by that time be at home where the family is.
20/1/24, 11:29 AM - +263 77 388 8622: Do you know why l am saying l need to discuss with, it is because the financial situation in Zimbabwe is not all that stable.
20/1/24, 11:38 AM - Dev Edoofa: I understand your concern, @263773888622! We surely understand your concern and yo ucan let us know about it after you have discussed about it with your family. <This message was edited>
20/1/24, 11:48 AM - +263 77 388 8622: Noted thank you, will let you know.
20/1/24, 11:52 AM - Dev Edoofa: You are most welcome!
22/1/24, 11:07 AM - Dev Edoofa: Good Morning Mr. Mushambi and Wynne!
I hope you are doing well. We will reconnect at 4:30 PM to take forward our conversation. Till then I wish you have a great day ahead!
22/1/24, 11:23 AM - +263 77 388 8622: Good morning good morning, how are you and work.Here we are doing well. Will be ready by 4:30 pm. Meet you then.
22/1/24, 4:38 PM - Dev Edoofa: This message was deleted
22/1/24, 4:38 PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Afternoon Mr. and Mrs. Mushambi and Wynne!
I hope you are doing well. We have our session right now. May I know if you are ready to take forward our conversation?
22/1/24, 4:40 PM - +263 77 388 8622: Good how are you. I am happy to connect and ready for the session.
22/1/24, 5:03 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that! May I know if you have discussed the Edoofa Secure Plan with your family?
22/1/24, 5:10 PM - +263 77 388 8622: Yes yes sir we had a lengthy discussion. We agreed that since our salaries are too far below poverty data line. We are getting too little in our salaries, so we have decided to kindly allow us to pay at least $30 per month so that we will be able to look for the family with the balances that we will have remained with. We had high hopes that our son might be lucky and get the full scholarship so that we will be relieved on fees. If you can allow us to sacrifice the amount l have mentioned above we will be very glad.
22/1/24, 7:13 PM - Dev Edoofa: I completely understand your concern @263773888622. But now that you know the universities that we have tie-ups with offer quality high education to its students. So, for that, they have hefty fees of around $6000-$8000 which the students have to pay, but with Edoofa, the fees are decreased to $2700-$3700 for Edoofians. Now, for preparing for the finances for the student's higher education, parents need to understand that the minimum they need to save per month is $150 to ensure that at the end of 20 months, they can save around $3000. But if the amount saved after 20 months is around $600, @263773888622 you need to understand that Wynne may miss out on the opportunity of studying in the prestigious universities of India at affordable prices. So, I wanted to understand if you have any other backup plans as well to ensure that you can fully finance Wynne's higher education here in India?
23/1/24, 4:10 PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Afternoon Mr.&Mrs. Mushambi and Wynne!
I hope you are doing well. We have our session today. May I know if you are ready for our conversation?
23/1/24, 4:24 PM - +263 77 388 8622: Hello Mr Kumar.
Very sorry for the inconvenience today. Tomorrow l will be ready and available.
23/1/24, 9:26 PM - Dev Edoofa: I understand @263773888622! We will have our session tomorrow at the same time. Till then I wish you a peaceful night!
23/1/24, 10:48 PM - +263 77 388 8622: Thank you, good night
24/1/24, 4:23 PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Afternoon Mr. Mushambi and Wynne!
I hope you are doing well. We have our session right now. May I know if you are ready to take forward our session?
24/1/24, 4:24 PM - +263 77 388 8622: Good afternoon good afternoon. I am ready for the sessions.
24/1/24, 4:52 PM - Dev Edoofa: That is good to know! May I know what do you feel about this?
24/1/24, 4:54 PM - +263 77 388 8622: It's good, we want our son to go to first class universities in India. We want him to go to the best universities.
24/1/24, 5:17 PM - Dev Edoofa: Right, we are also determined to assist you with the same. But for that we need to prepare the finances accordingly. So, I hope you are able to understand the importance of Edoofa Secure Plan?
24/1/24, 5:20 PM - +263 77 388 8622: Very true, l have come to understand it and see it as a very brilliant idea.
24/1/24, 5:29 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to know that!
24/1/24, 5:30 PM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know, Mr. Mushambi. For the current round of students, there are only 27 seats available for the students who can benefit from the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan. 

Since Wynne has been one of the most dedicated students, and I see he has great aspirations, I wanted him to be a part of the same set of students and start with your future planning the right way.
24/1/24, 5:30 PM - Dev Edoofa: Also, as this plan commences from the month of January, for the efficient implementation of this plan, we need to decide on a fixed date on which you will deposit $150 every month. This will provide you with the flexibility to align your finances accordingly.
24/1/24, 5:30 PM - Dev Edoofa: Our complete focus is on providing students and parents with the best ways to avail themselves of these opportunities. We understand that every parent may not be able to make the payment on our specified date. Therefore, considering this situation, we allow them to decide the payment date according to their comfort. In light of the same, may I know the fixed date every month on which you will deposit $150?
24/1/24, 5:40 PM - +263 77 388 8622: Great, thank you thank you.l am happy for you said Wynne has great aspirations. Thank you thank you
24/1/24, 5:42 PM - +263 77 388 8622: On the date, say one has failed to pay that month's money what will happen. Failing to pay not because of wanting to abscond but because of financial constraints.
24/1/24, 5:45 PM - +263 77 388 8622: Hello
24/1/24, 6:07 PM - Dev Edoofa: @263773888622 it is indeed reassuring to know that you have recognized the importance of the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan and that is why you shared such a concern. The plan was designed considering the challenges that students face when planning for their education abroad and how we can ensure our students are protected against them.
24/1/24, 6:07 PM - Dev Edoofa: Regarding the query you raised:

The foundation of the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan is built on the fundamentals of consistent saving, and thus, the payment installments are staggered on a monthly basis. The goal is to ensure that you, as a parent, can set aside $1500 for Wynne's education by November 2024, and hence each installment comes down to $150 per month. 

If, as a parent, you feel you cannot raise the $150 for a certain month, please share the same with us. We can better understand your situation and assess the amount you can contribute toward the installment in the same month, and help you cover the balance along with the next month's payment. This staggered structure ensures that you and Wynne don't have to worry about the educational finances when you are in India.

However, in the event a parent misses out on the entire month of payment and is unable to pay, a nominal interest/payment fine would be added to the installment. The interest decreases as you approach your goal of saving $1500 by November.
24/1/24, 6:07 PM - Dev Edoofa: <Media omitted>
24/1/24, 6:11 PM - +263 77 388 8622: Ok ok thank you thank you, will come to you shortly after doing some more consultations with family again.
24/1/24, 6:13 PM - Dev Edoofa: Surely @263773888622, however, before you do that, I would like to inquire if there are any other queries or concerns on your mind that you would like to discuss. Additionally, by when would you be able to have a discussion with your family and provide us with an update?

I want to understand this timeline since there are only 27 seats available, and as I have been working on Wynne's application all along, I want him to secure the best opportunities and be able to secure his spot in a timely manner.
24/1/24, 6:22 PM - +263 77 388 8622: Definitely if you can just give me 2 hours or less. I just want to have telephone conversation with family.
24/1/24, 6:23 PM - +263 77 388 8622: I have no queries or concerns except for doing what is required of us to do.
24/1/24, 6:35 PM - Dev Edoofa: Absolutely @263773888622, please take your time. Once you are done with your discussion, please get back to us and share the payment plan you have in place so that we can help Wynne get started with the procedures. 

Once you share the same details with us, we will proceed with the next steps, and we will be sharing an official agreement detailing the specifics of the Financial Secure Plan along with its benefits. This agreement is a crucial document that outlines the terms and conditions of your participation in the program. It serves as a legal framework ensuring transparency and mutual understanding between all parties involved.
24/1/24, 6:35 PM - Dev Edoofa: As we will prepare to send you the agreement, we will need the following details to personalize the document:

1. Full Name of Parent/Guardian/Sponsor responsible for catering to the student's finances [The representative in whose name you want the agreement to be]

2. Residential Address of the aforementioned representative.

3. Copy of Residential Address
24/1/24, 6:35 PM - Dev Edoofa: Providing accurate and up-to-date information is essential to ensure the seamless processing of your enrollment in the Financial Secure Plan. Once we receive these details, we will quickly ask the team to share the agreement with you for your review and signature.
24/1/24, 6:45 PM - +263 77 388 8622: 1.Full name of parent for catering the student's finances: Mushambi Walter.
2. Residential address for the aforementioned representative: Bspz Ministry of Primary and Secondary Education P.O Box 200, Murambinda.
3. Copy of residential address: As above.
24/1/24, 6:53 PM - Dev Edoofa: @263773888622, for the third point, you have to share a residential proof. It is a document that serves as evidence of a person's residence at a particular address. 

Residential proofs can include documents like utility bills (water, electricity, gas), rental agreements, property tax receipts, voter ID cards, and other official documents that indicate the person's residential address. Can you share such a document with us since it is a crucial part of one's financial secure agreement?
24/1/24, 7:01 PM - +263 77 388 8622: I will send, the water bill slip but the address there is different from the one above. The above one which l gave you is for where l work that is my work place. You will find that it will be different with the one on water bill slip where l stay/ live.
24/1/24, 7:03 PM - Dev Edoofa: I see @263773888622 and that would be absolutely fine. I will update the same to the team and they would process Wynne's application accordingly. There is nothing to be concerned with the same.
24/1/24, 7:05 PM - +263 77 388 8622: Thank you thank you for this move.
24/1/24, 7:44 PM - +263 77 388 8622: Hello, l talked with my wife about the issue. We agreed that we can sacrifice for every 30 of each month that is the payment of $150 towards Wynne's financial secure plan. But this is a sacrificial and we are assured that some of the days we won't have meals because all that month's money will have been paid towards this plan.
27/1/24, 10:47 AM - Dev Edoofa: Good Afternoon Mr. Mushambi!
I hope you are doing well and are having a wonderful start to the day. I felt a bit under the weather yesterday, so I took a couple of days off to focus on my health. Today, I am feeling better and completely ready to take our conversation forward.

I am glad to hear that you are ready to make short-term sacrifices and achieve the long-term goal of seeing Wynne become a successful individual in his life. I totally understand that if you follow this plan you may have some financial constraints for the next few months in your personal lives but in the end, this plan is for the betterment of Wynne only. After following this plan you would have made sure that Wynne is coming to India to pursue his dreams.

I hope you understand what I am trying to convey? <This message was edited>
27/1/24, 9:34 PM - +263 77 388 8622: Yes yes, l fully understand what you are saying. We are prepared to go an extra mile for our son to have a bright future.
29/1/24, 10:17 AM - Dev Edoofa: Good Morning @263773888622!
I hope you are doing well and had a peaceful weekend. I am glad to hear that and I must commend you and your family's mindset to provide your children with the best opportunities. For the current round of students, there are only 27 seats available for the students who can benefit from the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan. 

Since Wynne has been one of the most dedicated students, and I see he has great aspirations, I wanted him to be a part of the same set of students and start with his future planning the right way. <This message was edited>

29/1/24, 12:41 PM - Dev Edoofa: I have taken note from our previous conversations that you are ready to pay on the 30th of every month. May I please know if you have planned this date keeping in mind to initiate the plan in January, right?
30/1/24, 8:41 PM - +263 77 388 8622: Good evening good evening ma'am. It might seem as if l don't want to co-operate but it's not the case with me. It's because all these days, l am mainly doing field work at my work. So many of the times l will be out where there is no network and come back in the evening when sessions time is already lapsed. 
NB: May you kindly change my sessions schedule so that we will do it next week or next week but one. This time around l will be fully stationed at my work place without any movements. Hope you will understand me and help me in my plea. I am Wynne's father. Wynne is not allowed to have phones at his school during school time. So may you please understand me. I want Wynne to be at one of the prestigious Universities in India.
30/1/24, 8:45 PM - +263 77 388 8622: Yes, l am committed to be paying it on the 30th of every month. However l failed to beat/meet the 30 January deadline. I promise to rectify this problem in February
