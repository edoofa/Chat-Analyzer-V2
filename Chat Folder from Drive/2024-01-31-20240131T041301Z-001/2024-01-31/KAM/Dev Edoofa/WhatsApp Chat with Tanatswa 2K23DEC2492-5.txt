I hope you are clear about the purpose of the two groups.
8/1/24, 5:46 PM - +263 78 499 5799: So sir can I ask something
9/1/24, 1:34 PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Oslie!
I hope all of you are having a wonderful day ahead. We are excited to take forward the admission process and I trust that you are excited as well. Before starting our session, may I please know how are you all doing today?
9/1/24, 1:35 PM - Dev Edoofa: Since our operational hours were over yesterday, we were not able to reconnect. You can surely ask your query.
9/1/24, 1:37 PM - +263 78 499 5799: Good afternoon sir we are all fine
9/1/24, 1:39 PM - +263 78 499 5799: Sir I will be leaving for school tomorrow and we are not allowed to go with cellphones so are you comfortable to carry on without me
9/1/24, 1:48 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to know that, Mavis. I trust that you are going to excel in your semester at school.
9/1/24, 1:50 PM - Dev Edoofa: I completely understand your situation. What we can do is that, since you are going to be unavailable for further sessions, your parents/guardians can take part in these sessions and regularly update you with the proceedings in these sessions.
9/1/24, 1:51 PM - Dev Edoofa: Please let me know what do you feel about this?
9/1/24, 1:51 PM - +263 78 499 5799: Thank you so much sir I hope I will be frequently update

9/1/24, 1:57 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Moving forward in our today’s session, we will discuss a bit about your university admission journey. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts. I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them.

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
9/1/24, 1:59 PM - +263 78 499 5799: Yes we can start sir
9/1/24, 2:11 PM - +263 77 238 5097: Good afternoon,i am available for some time. We can proceed.
9/1/24, 2:21 PM - Dev Edoofa: <Media omitted>
9/1/24, 2:30 PM - +263 77 238 5097: I have gone through it.
9/1/24, 2:33 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
9/1/24, 2:33 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
9/1/24, 2:37 PM - +263 77 238 5097: Yes Mr ,they are clear.
9/1/24, 2:39 PM - +263 78 499 5799: Yes they are clear sir
9/1/24, 2:45 PM - Dev Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
9/1/24, 2:45 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
9/1/24, 2:50 PM - +263 78 499 5799: Yes I am following
9/1/24, 2:50 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process, the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
9/1/24, 2:50 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
9/1/24, 2:54 PM - +263 78 499 5799: Yes sir
9/1/24, 2:54 PM - +263 78 499 5799: Does the student acquire the VISA on their own or you will assist
9/1/24, 3:01 PM - +263 77 238 5097: We will assist her.
9/1/24, 3:06 PM - Dev Edoofa: Our DSW team is going to assist you in acquiring a visa and help you with the total process. I hope I was able to clear your query?
9/1/24, 3:09 PM - +263 78 499 5799: Yes you did clear it sir
9/1/24, 4:14 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that! Since our operational hours are over, we will reconnect tomorrow to move forward with our session. Till then I will share with you the First step, i.e., *Message from the founder's office*.
9/1/24, 4:15 PM - Dev Edoofa: In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
9/1/24, 4:15 PM - Dev Edoofa: For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention.
9/1/24, 4:15 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students*

This is a video by the founders of EDOOFA, in which they share 2 important qualities of successful Edoofians- who've secured a maximum scholarship and earned scholarship credits.

9/1/24, 4:15 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

The third video is about Schools, Colleges, and Universities. I'm sure you're excited to learn more about the schools, colleges, and universities on the Edoofa Platform. Founders talk about their decade-long journey of discovering these schools and the experiences that students are having in these schools.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DW82emflFHw&feature=youtu.be
9/1/24, 4:15 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP*

The fourth video is about the Statement of Purpose (SOP). The most important step towards securing a good scholarship is to write the Statement of Purpose but to know why it is important, watching this video will clear your doubts and questions.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftsGGGBYMrs&feature=youtu.be
9/1/24, 4:16 PM - Dev Edoofa: Tanatswa, I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection. 

Please go through the 4 videos, our next session will be scheduled after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarize your understanding.
9/1/24, 4:16 PM - Dev Edoofa: Have a great evening ahead!
9/1/24, 4:17 PM - +263 77 238 5097: Same to you Mr Kumar.
12/1/24, 12:54 PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Tanatswa!

With great excitement and pride, I want to share that over the past few days, the Edoofa team has been immersed in an exciting event we had in store for our students. Edoofa hosted a conference - the Symposium of Leaders, Innovators, and Creators at Edoofa, also known as 'SLICE-CON.'

The conference was attended by all the Edoofians of 2023 and a few senior Edoofians from previous batches. It focused on the art of creation, innovation, and, most importantly, the mindset required to make an impact in one's career.
12/1/24, 12:54 PM - Dev Edoofa: During this Industrial Visit and the conference - SLICE CON, Corporate leaders, such as the CEOs and Co-founders from renowned companies like Rage Coffee, Sirona Hygiene, Jolin New York, and more, shared their insights and experience. These individuals are at the helm of multi-millionaire brands, leading large marketing teams. Their presence added immense value, providing students with the opportunity to engage in transformative conversations.
12/1/24, 12:54 PM - Dev Edoofa: We believe that interactions with such industry leaders can bring significant transformations to students' lives, enhancing their business acumen. Our Edoofians maximized this opportunity, having life-changing conversations with these influential figures. The main objective of the event was to emphasize the importance of thinking outside the box, encouraging students to believe in themselves and their dreams. Before we start our session today, I wanted to share a glimpse of the event, and I hope you are excited to attend similar events when you come to India.

15/1/24, 11:03 AM - +263 77 238 5097: These days Tanatswa is not available because she has gone back to school.
15/1/24, 11:06 AM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for informing @263772385097. I completely understand. Since Tanatswa is going to be unavailable for further sessions, I believe parents should actively participate in these sessions, as delays in these sessions may seriously affect the timelines of Tanatswa's admission journey. So, May I please know if you are available for the sessions?
15/1/24, 11:18 AM - +263 77 238 5097: Yes i am available maybe up to 1300 hrs

15/1/24, 11:26 AM - +263 77 238 5097: I will update her sometime later because she doesn't use her phone at school.
15/1/24, 11:28 AM - Dev Edoofa: No worries, @263772385097. I understand.
15/1/24, 11:28 AM - Dev Edoofa: May I please know your understanding of each of the 4 videos that were shared with you?

15/1/24, 11:55 AM - Dev Edoofa: That is great to hear! Now, it is our responsibility to move NAME’S application ahead and help NAME to write a proper statement of purpose so that she can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on Tanatswa’s application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, we would require Tanatswa’s availability for approximately 30 minutes. If she is unavailable, she can provide you with her input, and you can proceed with the statement of purpose on her behalf.
15/1/24, 11:56 AM - Dev Edoofa: 1. I am sure you have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in Tanatswa's admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

15/1/24, 12:03 PM - +263 77 238 5097: As i have indicated above that Tanatswa is at school these days and it's a boarding schoo. I will have to get in touch with her today or tomorrow so that she completes her part of questions.So i will get in touch with you tomorrow.

16/1/24, 10:12 AM - Dev Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Tanatswa!
How are you all doing today?
17/1/24, 9:34 AM - +263 77 238 5097: Good morning. Just to update you. As we have said before, Tanatswa is yet to respond to the questions we forwarded her. The rules at schoo do not allow them much time on phones.Once she answers i will forward to you.
17/1/24, 10:09 PM - Dev Edoofa: Hello @263772385097!
I hope you are doing well. Thank you for updating me on the status, it is very much appreciated. Since we were not able to take forward our conversation today, we will have our session tomorrow at 3:00 pm. I hope that till then Tanatswa will be able to provide you with the responses. Till then wishing you a blessed night! <This message was edited>
18/1/24, 9:01 AM - +263 77 238 5097: Morning Mr Kumar. I hope so but am still waiting for her response.Once she respond i will update you.
18/1/24, 3:20 PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Afternoon @263772385097!
I hope you are doing well. We have a session today. May I know if Tanatswa was able to respond to the qusetions?
18/1/24, 3:29 PM - +263 77 238 5097: Good afternoon Mr Kumar I have just talked to her this afternoon and she is in the process of doing the work. I think if we can schedule for tomorrow mid morning.
18/1/24, 9:33 PM - Dev Edoofa: Hello @263772385097!
I hope you are doing well. Thank you for updating me on the status, it is very much appreciated. It is not possible for me to schedule our session for mid-morning as I have many other sessions scheduled for that time. We will have our session tomorrow at 3:00 pm. I hope that till then Tanatswa will be able to provide you with the responses. Till then wishing you a blessed night!
19/1/24, 8:20 AM - +263 77 238 5097: Good morning.Let's schedule like that hoping we would have the response then.
19/1/24, 3:03 PM - +263 77 238 5097: Good afternoon Mr Kumar. Tanatswa is still sending the responses but hasn't finished yet. I will send after she finished all questions.
19/1/24, 3:10 PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Afternoon @263772385097!
I hope you are doing well. Thank you for informing, I have taken note of it and will update it in our records as well. May I know when will she be able to send you the responses?
19/1/24, 3:21 PM - +263 77 238 5097: I believe up to Monday the responses Will be available.
19/1/24, 4:20 PM - +263 77 238 5097: <Media omitted>
19/1/24, 4:20 PM - +263 77 238 5097: The major difference between rights and duties is rights are powers given by state to it's citizens for self development whereas duties are responsibilities and liabilities stipulated by the state to maintain law and order.Rights are not forced to be exercised whereas there is subjection to punishment if duties are not fulfilled.Rights provide freedom to any person who has them for example the right to education whereas duties limit one's freedom for example people pay tax to save public property.Both human rights and civil rights protect against discrimination, injustice and inequality.On an international level,as civil rights are determined by the laws or constitutions of an individual county,and human rights are considered universal to any human beings.Some human rights become civil rights when government chooses to put them into national laws.A simple definition that human rights are rights you have simply for being human.Comparatively,civil rights are contextual, meaning you are intitled to specific civil rights for being citizen to a particular nation.
19/1/24, 4:21 PM - +263 77 238 5097: 3.The primary difference between the responsibilities of an attorney and a prosecutor is the attorney has less experience and might not represent clients in courts.This brings out the idea that prosecutors are more familiar with the public sphere and have the ability to solve matters legally.A prosecutor is a legitimate employee of the judicial branch of government.An attorney can do some other tasks but these are carried out within the private sphere.This clearly illustrates that a prosecutor holds an upper hand in issues such as witnessing and handling concessions and other cases more than an attorney can.Comparatively, prosecutors are more qualified in legal matters and can represent their clients in court.
19/1/24, 4:21 PM - +263 77 238 5097: The branch of law I am interested in is civil law.Civil law focuses on protecting individuals' freedom from violation by governments, political and social organizations and individuals.The reason why I am interested in becoming a civil lawyer is to protect citizens from discrimination that comes from such perpetrators as political individuals and grant them freedom in the nation.The idea of humanity pushes me to pursue this branch of law.I am passionate about protecting people's freedom from violation by authorities and non governmental individuals.Although this might depend on the country one might belong to,it is of complex importance to me for everyone to attain justice in any way possible
19/1/24, 4:22 PM - +263 77 238 5097: 5.I have five key skills that I believe can make me a successful lawyer.To begin with,I am a very confident young lady and I believe this can make me a successful lawyer.Public speaking is another skill that is naturally within me.For example I am able to address large groups of people with a loud and clear voice and confidence within my gestures.A convincing speech is another skill that gives me the courage that I can be a successful lawyer.I am capable of liaising to any level possible.I  am also a trustworthy person because I do whatever task I am given with honesty.Lastly I have a skill of analysing situations, statements and even gestures and this is evident enough that I can become a successful lawyer
19/1/24, 4:24 PM - +263 77 238 5097: Good afternoon,these are Tanatswa's responses.
22/1/24, 3:15 PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Tanatswa!
I hope you are doing well. Thank you for sharing your responses to the documents. Please fill out the Statement of Purpose form and share the screenshot as well.
22/1/24, 3:22 PM - +263 77 238 5097: Ok sorry,had put much concentration on the above leaving the forms.Let me check.
22/1/24, 3:26 PM - +263 77 238 5097: So can i fill the form on behalf of Tanatswa.
22/1/24, 3:38 PM - Dev Edoofa: Yes, @263772385097, it can be filled.
22/1/24, 3:45 PM - +263 77 238 5097: Can you send me the Statement of purpose form please I think i misplaced it.
22/1/24, 3:50 PM - Dev Edoofa: here it is @263772385097
23/1/24, 2:04 PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Afternoon Mr. and Mrs. Machokoto!
I hope you are doing well. May I know if you were able to fill out the SOP form?
23/1/24, 3:30 PM - +263 77 238 5097: Good afternoon Sir. I am in the process of filling it right now.
23/1/24, 3:47 PM - Dev Edoofa: Okay @263772385097! Whenever you are done, please let me know!
24/1/24, 3:14 PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Afternoon Mr. and Mrs. Machokoto!
I hope you are doing well. May I know if you were able to completely fill out the SOP form? We have our session right now.
25/1/24, 9:23 AM - +263 77 238 5097: Morning Mr Kumar, sorry was offline yesterday. I am available now to fill the form.
26/1/24, 9:44 AM - Dev Edoofa: Good Morning Mr. and Mrs. Machokoto!
I hope you are doing well and are having a wonderful start to the day. I felt a bit under the weather yesterday, so I took a day off to focus on my health. Today, I am feeling better and completely ready to take our conversation forward. We will have our session at 3:00 PM to take forward our conversation. I hope by that time you will have completed the Statement Of Purpose . <This message was edited>
26/1/24, 9:47 AM - +263 77 238 5097: I have completed the SOP.
26/1/24, 9:49 AM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know @263772385097! I have taken note of it.
26/1/24, 9:49 AM - Dev Edoofa: May I know if you are available for our session right now?
26/1/24, 9:51 AM - +263 77 238 5097: Yes Mr Kumar.I am available.
26/1/24, 9:52 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that!
26/1/24, 9:53 AM - Dev Edoofa: With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey. we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*.
26/1/24, 9:54 AM - Dev Edoofa: However, before we start the same, I was going through your scholarship application file and noticed that you are supposed to make the payment of your remaining part of Edoofa Enrollment fee. Hence, I thought of sharing a gentle reminder with you and trying to understand how your preparation has been so far? Have you been able to align your preparations in the right direction?
26/1/24, 9:54 AM - +263 77 238 5097: That's good.
26/1/24, 9:55 AM - +263 77 238 5097: Yes ,we are planning to pay that figure before end of January.
26/1/24, 9:58 AM - Dev Edoofa: Thanks for letting me know, I have taken note of it and will accordingly update the accounts team.
26/1/24, 9:59 AM - +263 77 238 5097: Our preparation have been going on . We are aligning our programs and budgets with that.
26/1/24, 9:59 AM - Dev Edoofa: In the meantime. Let us move forward with our discussion. To confirm our records: the course you've selected for Tanatswa's higher education is BA LLB and it's my understanding that she is  planning to arrive in India during August 2025. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
26/1/24, 10:02 AM - +263 77 238 5097: We had planned that she is supposed to be enrolled in the coming year. We are nor yet aware of the dates of being in India.
26/1/24, 10:04 AM - Dev Edoofa: With coming year you mean 2025, right?
26/1/24, 10:05 AM - +263 77 238 5097: Yes 2025 that's correct.
26/1/24, 10:09 AM - Dev Edoofa: Thanks for your confirmation. Based on our experience of over 14 years and having assisted over 5000 students from different countries, we have realized that financial planning is the most important factor when a student plans for his/her higher education abroad.
26/1/24, 10:09 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am sure that you must be aware that 20-30% of students who are admitted into universities abroad are unable to fulfill their dream and come to India due to a lack of financial planning. The funds needed for booking flights, accommodation, and covering living expenses after arrival often become overwhelming, leading to the decision to defer their admission for a year. This, in turn, creates a gap in the child's education.
26/1/24, 10:09 AM - Dev Edoofa: To assist both students and parents in this regard, Edoofa Management has designed a Financial Secure Plan that aims to help you prepare for your higher educational finances without experiencing stress or last-minute rushes. I believe you must be wondering about the details of the same plan and how it helps the parents?
26/1/24, 10:14 AM - +263 77 238 5097: True. We want to know.
26/1/24, 10:22 AM - Dev Edoofa: Edoofa Secure Plan is important for parents who have children joining the university for tertiary education in the next one to two years for several reasons:
26/1/24, 10:22 AM - Dev Edoofa: *Financial Preparedness:* The Edoofa Secure plan helps parents prepare financially for the costs after the Scholarship being offered so that they are not caught off guard.

*Reduced Financial Stress:* Having the Edoofa Secure Plan in place can significantly reduce the financial stress on you as parents when your child is about to enter university. Knowing that there is a dedicated fund for education expenses provides peace of mind.
26/1/24, 10:22 AM - Dev Edoofa: *Avoiding Debt*: Without proper savings, some parents may resort to taking out loans or accumulating credit card debt to cover their child's education costs. This Educational savings plan helps avoid the burden of debt and high-interest payments.

*Compound Interest:* By starting to save early and consistently contributing to the savings plan, parents can take advantage of compound interest, which can significantly increase the amount available for education expenses.
26/1/24, 10:22 AM - Dev Edoofa: *Flexibility and Control:* The Edoofa Secure savings plans allow parents to have greater control over their finances and how they allocate funds for their child's education. They can choose investment options that align with their risk tolerance and financial goals.

*Encouraging Responsibility*: Involving your child in the process of saving for their education teaches them financial responsibility and the value of higher education. It also motivates them to outperform in Academics.
26/1/24, 10:22 AM - Dev Edoofa: *Adapting to Unexpected Changes*: Life is full of surprises, and circumstances can change especially when there are political reforms changing each day impacting the Local Currency. Having an Edoofa Secure Plan allows parents to adapt to unexpected changes in their financial situation while still prioritizing their child's education.

*Peace of Mind:* Overall, having the Edoofa Secure plan provides parents with peace of mind, knowing that they are actively planning for their child's future and increasing the likelihood of providing them with a solid education.
26/1/24, 10:22 AM - Dev Edoofa: Now, when you go through all the above benefits, I am sure you can see that the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan is an important financial tool for parents/students who are supposed to enter the university soon. 

It helps ensure that the financial aspect of tertiary education is well-managed, reduces stress, and allows parents to provide the best opportunities for their children without resorting to debt or financial hardship. Isn't this something you and your family also wish to have?
26/1/24, 11:23 AM - +263 77 238 5097: Yes i have gone through the above. I want to know is there a facility for parents to save with.
26/1/24, 11:55 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through the above points, do you want me to help you understand how the Edoofa Secure Plan works?
26/1/24, 11:58 AM - +263 77 238 5097: That will be good
26/1/24, 12:12 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, as you are aware, we are currently in January 2024, and we have a good 20 months to plan for your finances before you start your university education in 2025.
26/1/24, 12:12 PM - Dev Edoofa: During the counseling session, you were informed that at Edoofa, we guarantee a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship on the tuition fees. Hence, the cost of education, including food and accommodation after the scholarship, would be between $2000-$3000, and it could be even less. Not more than that.
26/1/24, 12:12 PM - Dev Edoofa: This means that if you can save $150 per month for the next 20 months, you will be able to save $3000. This amount is more than enough for the first year of university fees, including tuition fees (if any), food, and accommodation. I hope you agree with this?
26/1/24, 1:44 PM - Dev Edoofa: Are you available @263772385097?
26/1/24, 2:45 PM - +263 77 238 5097: Thank you for the information and idea.
26/1/24, 2:48 PM - +263 77 238 5097: Sorry, i had a network challenge but i am back
26/1/24, 2:52 PM - Dev Edoofa: I understand the ntwork challenges that you maybe facing. Let's move forward!
26/1/24, 2:52 PM - Dev Edoofa: May I know if you agree with this?
26/1/24, 2:54 PM - +263 77 238 5097: Yes i agree and will start to implement it.
26/1/24, 2:58 PM - Dev Edoofa: Right, this means that by the time Tanatswa would be in India, you would have already saved the $3000 that will cover the first-year fee.
26/1/24, 2:58 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, in these next 20 months, I am sure you would also be engaged in the EWYL program, and if you secure a minimum of $1000 in 20 months, that means the fees for 1.5 years are already secured.
26/1/24, 2:58 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, for a 3-year course, if we follow the same approach for the remaining 1.5 years, the educational journey for the student and the financial journey for the parent will be easy and smooth. I believe you must be able to see this perspective?
26/1/24, 3:01 PM - +263 77 238 5097: Thank you for the insight. I believe if we are to follow this route we won't have challenges.
26/1/24, 3:01 PM - Dev Edoofa: Exactly,@263772385097!
26/1/24, 3:02 PM - Dev Edoofa: With that said, there is also another benefit, I am sure being in Zimbabwe you know how drastically the exchange rate fluctuates.
26/1/24, 3:02 PM - Dev Edoofa: If you are buying a dollar today, you might be spending 7000 bonds, but if you buy a dollar after a month, the rate would be different.
26/1/24, 3:02 PM - Dev Edoofa: Also, even if you choose to buy dollars every month and save at your home, it is not safe since there is news of robbery, and mugging every day.
26/1/24, 3:02 PM - Dev Edoofa: In that case, you will opt to save in the Bank, but again we know that savings in the Bank require a Nostro Account which means you have to pay the bank to keep your money safe, right?
26/1/24, 3:05 PM - +263 77 238 5097: Yaa that's correct.Measures are needed in safe keeping the money.
26/1/24, 3:06 PM - Dev Edoofa: Yes, Mr. Machokoto. Considering these constraints, Edoofa Management has decided to help the parents and students prepare for the journey way ahead of time by helping them save money with Edoofa without any additional charges but rather saving additional money as well. Do you want me to explain how this has been achieved?
26/1/24, 3:07 PM - +263 77 238 5097: Yes we might consider it , explain.
26/1/24, 3:09 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Program Fee (Enrollment Fee) that you were asked to pay is $350. From the $350, you have already paid $200, and the remaining $150  before your due date of 01-Feb-2024.
26/1/24, 3:10 PM - Dev Edoofa: Under the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan, a parent has to deposit a small amount of money which is $150 every month for the next 10 months. 

That means, in 10 months, the money saved will be $1500. When this money is saved, Edoofa will waive off the remaining $150 which was due from the Edoofa Program/Enrollment Fee of $350, thereby making a straight saving of $150 in 10 months.
26/1/24, 3:10 PM - Dev Edoofa: Imagine you paying $15 every month to the Bank of Zimbabwe to keep your money safe, and here Edoofa is paying you $15 every month to keep your money safe. Now, you must be wondering, why only for 10 months and not for 20 months, right?
26/1/24, 3:12 PM - +263 77 238 5097: Exactly, wanted to ask.
26/1/24, 3:17 PM - +263 77 238 5097: Mr Kumar , something cropped up now so i am going out of office so may be available.
26/1/24, 3:27 PM - Dev Edoofa: No worries, @263772385097. You are going to be available, right?
27/1/24, 8:24 AM - Dev Edoofa: Good Morning @263772385097!
I hope you are doing well. We were discussing the Edoofa Secure Plan yesterday but were not able to take forward our conversation. We will have our session at 12:30 PM to discuss the beneficial aspects of the Edoofa Secure Plan. May I know if you are going to be available at that time?
29/1/24, 2:10 PM - +263 77 238 5097: Good afternoon. Was away this weekend and couldn't get your message. I am busy these days but can get time here and there for our discussions.
29/1/24, 2:16 PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Afternoon @263772385097!
I hope you are doing well and had a wonderful weekend. I understand the challenges that you are facing. May I know if you are ready for the session right now?
29/1/24, 2:23 PM - +263 77 238 5097: Yes am available. We can proceed.
29/1/24, 2:26 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that! May I know if you are caught up till here and does the same question arises in your mind? <This message was edited>
29/1/24, 2:34 PM - +263 77 238 5097: I got what you said and it made some sense.I don't have any questions.
29/1/24, 2:38 PM - Dev Edoofa: This message was deleted
29/1/24, 2:38 PM - Dev Edoofa: Great! If you see the bigger picture, you will realize that the reason is quite simple. Upon the completion of the 10 installments, the Edoofa Admissions team will initiate the Child’s Admission Process by applying early to the universities to secure their scholarship and their university seat.
29/1/24, 2:38 PM - Dev Edoofa: Reserving seats earlier increases the chances of obtaining a maximum scholarship. A higher scholarship means lower fees, and by securing the seat, you will be entitled to pay the fees as per the old fee structure of the university, not the new one implemented in January 2025. Furthermore, when applying to the universities, you will receive an offer letter or a letter of intent detailing the fees, scholarship, and registration fees.
29/1/24, 2:38 PM - Dev Edoofa: As explained during the enrollment process, the registration fee is a portion of your first-year university fee, paid to reserve the seat. It ranges from $500-$1000 and is not an additional fee. 

From the $1500 you saved with Edoofa, the registration fee will be paid to the university, securing the seat. For instance, if the registration fee is $1000, Edoofa will pay $1000 from the $1500 saved in 10 months. The updated balance with Edoofa will be $500, which will be paid to the university upon your arrival in India.
29/1/24, 2:38 PM - Dev Edoofa: This eases the financial burden on the parent, as there is no immediate payment required upon the student's arrival. The $500 saved will cover the remaining fees for the semester/year, as specified in the offer letter from the university. What are your thoughts on this?
29/1/24, 2:48 PM - +263 77 238 5097: That's great. So the amount will be paid like when.
29/1/24, 3:15 PM - Dev Edoofa: May I please ask you to help me understand this query in detail?
30/1/24, 10:01 AM - Dev Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Tanatswa!
I hope you are doing well. I want to assist you in getting started with your EWYL Journey. Since there was a delay in initiating the EWYL program,   They are prepared to initiate your EWYL program today, i.e. 30th January. 

To kick-start the process, your dedicated EWYL Mentor has established your EWYL Group and shared the invitation link with us. Here's what you and your parents/guardian/sponsor need to do:
30/1/24, 10:02 AM - Dev Edoofa: https://chat.whatsapp.com/Lccejsb6OsHHlnytphlzhJ

"Use the above-provided link to join your group. Once both you and your parents have joined, please send the following message to the group:

*Dear Mentor, my name is Mavis Tanatswa Machokoto, and my EWYL group name is Tanatswa EWYL23E1127. I am excited to begin my EWYL Journey. As discussed with the admission team, I am committed to being available on 30/01/2024 to commence the procedures. Kindly schedule my session for the same date so that I can maximize the benefits and start on the right track.*"
30/1/24, 10:02 AM - Dev Edoofa: Once you start with the EWYL Program and are able to connect with your mentor, please update the same here as well by sending the below message -

*Hello Admission officer, I am now in touch with my EWYL Mentor. The name of my Mentor is _________ and he/she has scheduled my session for ________*(mention the date)
30/1/24, 10:02 AM - Dev Edoofa: I hope these instructions are clear? <This message was edited>
30/1/24, 11:20 AM - +263 77 238 5097: Yes it is clear and I have done so.
30/1/24, 11:33 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that! May I know if you are ready to take our conversation forward? <This message was edited>
30/1/24, 11:34 AM - +263 77 238 5097: Yes , i am ready.
30/1/24, 11:40 AM - Dev Edoofa: That is good to know! May I please ask you to help me understand this query in detail?
30/1/24, 11:47 AM - +263 77 238 5097: Yes was asking on the above that when can one start to pay the money to Edoofa for savings.
30/1/24, 11:49 AM - Dev Edoofa: Yes, surely we will get to that point. But for now, let's move forward
30/1/24, 11:49 AM - Dev Edoofa: Shall we?
30/1/24, 11:51 AM - +263 77 238 5097: Yes please.
30/1/24, 11:51 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to see that we are together so far. With this plan for the next 10 months, I am sure you must be wondering what will happen in the next 10 months, considering you have already secured your scholarship seat with the university due to your hard work in the first 10 months. Is my understanding correct?
30/1/24, 11:52 AM - +263 77 238 5097: Correct.
30/1/24, 11:52 AM - Dev Edoofa: Let me help you with that as well. In the 11th month, you will be guided to open an FBC Mastercard bank account in Zimbabwe with a deposit of $150. The reason for this is that when you apply for your student Visa, the Embassy asks for a Bank Statement, and this account will serve that purpose.
30/1/24, 11:52 AM - Dev Edoofa: We understand it might be expensive if you deposit another $1500 for the remaining 10 months in FB  Bank Zimbabwe, so to avoid the same challenges, we have designed the plan accordingly. You will only be depositing for the 11th, 12th, 13th, and 14th month, which is 4 months.
30/1/24, 11:53 AM - Dev Edoofa: Once the 4 months are completed, our Department of Student Welfare (DSW) team will assist you with your visa process. The bank statement will act as one of the required documents, and once you receive the visa, you can withdraw the amount from FBC and book the flight ticket. This will help you utilize the money as well. How does it sound?
30/1/24, 11:58 AM - +263 77 238 5097: Ok i gr get your point.
30/1/24, 12:01 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that! Now, from the 16th Month till the 20th month, considering it is a 6-month window, you can again continue depositing the money ($150) with Edoofa which can be used in the fee as and when required or you can decide to save this $900 of these 6 months with you as well. This is something which you are free to choose. I hope you understand the financial secure plan now?
30/1/24, 12:02 PM - +263 77 238 5097: Its becoming clear.I now know.
30/1/24, 12:04 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that! Now that you have all the information, I want you to take some time and discuss the financial security plan with your family members. Help them understand its importance and details. Once you're done, we can reconnect, have a discussion, and address any queries you may have. After resolving your concerns, I'll guide you through starting your financial security plan.
30/1/24, 12:09 PM - +263 77 238 5097: That's good. So let me discuss with the family today and connect tomorrow.
