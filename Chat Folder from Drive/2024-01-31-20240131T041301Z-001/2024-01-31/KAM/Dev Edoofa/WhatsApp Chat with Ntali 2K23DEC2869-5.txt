With great excitement and pride, I want to share that over the past few days, the Edoofa team has been immersed in an exciting event we had in store for our students. Edoofa hosted a conference - the Symposium of Leaders, Innovators, and Creators at Edoofa, also known as 'SLICE-CON.'

The conference was attended by all the Edoofians of 2023 and a few senior Edoofians from previous batches. It focused on the art of creation, innovation, and, most importantly, the mindset required to make an impact in one's career. <This message was edited>
12/1/24, 12:55 PM - Dev Edoofa: During this Industrial Visit and the conference - SLICE CON, Corporate leaders, such as the CEOs and Co-founders from renowned companies like Rage Coffee, Sirona Hygiene, Jolin New York, and more, shared their insights and experience. These individuals are at the helm of multi-millionaire brands, leading large marketing teams. Their presence added immense value, providing students with the opportunity to engage in transformative conversations.
12/1/24, 12:55 PM - Dev Edoofa: We believe that interactions with such industry leaders can bring significant transformations to students' lives, enhancing their business acumen. Our Edoofians maximized this opportunity, having life-changing conversations with these influential figures. The main objective of the event was to emphasize the importance of thinking outside the box, and encouraging students to believe in themselves and their dreams. Before we start our session today, I wanted to share a glimpse of the event, and I hope you are excited to attend similar events when you come to India.
12/1/24, 12:56 PM - Dev Edoofa: <Media omitted>

12/1/24, 1:22 PM - +260 97 9151577: yes please
12/1/24, 1:22 PM - Dev Edoofa: Great! Moving forward in our today’s session, we will discuss a bit about your university admission journey. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts. I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them.

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
12/1/24, 1:23 PM - +260 97 9151577: sure thing
12/1/24, 1:26 PM - Dev Edoofa: <Media omitted>
12/1/24, 1:27 PM - +260 97 9151577: I'm done
12/1/24, 2:00 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
12/1/24, 2:00 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
12/1/24, 2:03 PM - +260 97 9151577: yes sir
12/1/24, 2:06 PM - Dev Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
12/1/24, 2:06 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
12/1/24, 2:09 PM - +260 97 9151577: are these sessions daily ?
12/1/24, 2:09 PM - +260 97 9151577: yes I am
12/1/24, 2:11 PM - Dev Edoofa: These sessions are not going to be daily but for just a couple of days.
12/1/24, 2:11 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process, the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
12/1/24, 2:11 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
12/1/24, 2:13 PM - +260 97 9151577: yes sir
12/1/24, 2:15 PM - Dev Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
12/1/24, 2:15 PM - +260 97 9151577: yes sir
12/1/24, 2:15 PM - Dev Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
12/1/24, 2:15 PM - Dev Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding until you are ready, shall we start with our discussion with me individually? 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
12/1/24, 2:18 PM - +260 97 9151577: yes please
12/1/24, 2:21 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students*

This is a video by the founders of EDOOFA, in which they share 2 important qualities of successful Edoofians- who've secured a maximum scholarship and earned scholarship credits.

2.A right is an entitlement a person is born with these entitlements are inalienable, universal and indivisible. A right is sanctioned by the government to protect the interests of the people and also against ill-treatment and inequality. Examples of such right are the right to life, privacy, voting, etc. some rights, however, are not protected by law or even sanctioned by the government, rights like self-determination (collective rights). Rights like Civil and Political rights are quite the opposite and can be defended in the courts of law.
Whereas duties are given to individuals that have proven responsible enough to take the task assigned to them, usually by in higher offices or elderly people. They are usually overseen by the people that assigns the duty they are also regarded as obligations one has to fulfil. In a case of an organisation it’s the duty of the company clerk to organise meetings, this role is usually over seen and tasked by their higher offices.
3. An attorney by definition is a person(lawyer) appointed to act on behalf of someone or company concerning legal matters. The attorney has to be admitted to the bar before he is able to represent someone in the courts of law concerning any legal matters. He/she is able to advise people on any legal matter and defend them in any aspect of, law be it corporate, civil and criminal cases. They work individually to gather evidence and necessary documents for their defence.
Whereas a prosecutor by definition is a person, public official who institutes legal proceedings against someone. He is in charge of all criminal proceedings and represents the government, he also brings defendants in criminal cases to justice in the name of the state/ the crown. A Prosecutor can only defend the government and only in criminal cases. The prosecutor works in conjunction with the police and other governmental entities that work to his favour.
4.Corporate law.
I want to be involved actively in the building and upholding of companies and organisations, in turn I will know the building blocks of the company and l, one day, will be able to start my own company with the knowledge I will acquire. I would like to see organisations grow and reach greater heights with the contributions I make to the decisions, help like give advice on partnerships and making deals that benefit both parties. I want to be able to help and control interaction within the company and between the company and the people. By putting up policies and agreements to protect the interests of the company and the people. I want to one day make deals with big companies and protect the interest of the people and the company as I make those deals. Also I want to ensure compliancy, organisation and navigate the laws that govern the does and don’ts of the company.  
 5.My organisation skills are quite a skill because I can be able to organise my work and work around me making work a lot easier to navigate. I have okay social skills that can help me work with anyone, these social skills I believe can help make good negotiations and deals, convincing people with factual information. Example, I am able to talk to any type of people and understand their point of view.  I believe my creativity caters as a skill that can help me make new and innovative agreements that benefit all parties. I am able to analyse and understand situations effectively giving the ability to make decision not based on emotion. With due time I believe my skills will develop in accordance to my course and more skills will be learnt and developed.
