This group is dedicated to all-important discussions like your university admission process, offer letter discussion, and ultimately your university registration and reservation of your scholarship along with the Visa process. This group will continue to assist you with your admission-related queries while you are here in India.

This group will keep a record of the tasks and projects you undertake.

For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts. I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them.

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
19/1/24, 12:22 PM - +263 71 132 2777: Yes we can start
19/1/24, 12:27 PM - Dev Edoofa: <Media omitted>
19/1/24, 12:38 PM - +263 71 132 2777: I'm done sir
19/1/24, 12:39 PM - +263 71 132 2777: <Media omitted>
19/1/24, 12:42 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
19/1/24, 12:42 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
19/1/24, 12:45 PM - +263 71 132 2777: Yes sir they are clearly
19/1/24, 12:45 PM - Dev Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
19/1/24, 12:45 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
19/1/24, 12:52 PM - +263 71 132 2777: Yes yes i am
19/1/24, 12:56 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process, the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
19/1/24, 12:56 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
19/1/24, 1:22 PM - Dev Edoofa: Have taken note of these steps?
19/1/24, 1:44 PM - +263 71 132 2777: Yes sir i have
19/1/24, 1:45 PM - Dev Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
19/1/24, 1:47 PM - +263 71 132 2777: Yes sir we can
19/1/24, 1:52 PM - Dev Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
19/1/24, 1:52 PM - Dev Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding until you are ready, shall we start with our discussion with me individually? 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
19/1/24, 2:31 PM - +263 71 132 2777: Yes sir i am excited to see them
19/1/24, 2:37 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students*

This is a video by the founders of EDOOFA, in which they share 2 important qualities of successful Edoofians- who've secured a maximum scholarship and earned scholarship credits.

https://youtu.be/SIh6DcQsqYM
19/1/24, 2:37 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s vision for you*

22/1/24, 12:42 PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Afternoon Mr. and Mrs. Taruvinga and Casper!
I hope you are doing well. We have our session right now. May I know if you are ready to take forward our session?
22/1/24, 6:02 PM - +263 71 132 2777: How are you sir
22/1/24, 9:57 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am doing well. Caspar, may I know why were you late to your session today? If you or your parents are facing any kind of challenges in attending the sessions at the scheduled time, please let us know. It will help us to align ourselves better.
22/1/24, 10:18 PM - +263 71 132 2777: Ok so today the main reason was because there was some installations of cameras at school so that disturbed the wifi router at school that is why in could not communicate at the stated time
23/1/24, 10:11 AM - Dev Edoofa: Good Morning Casper! 
I hope you are doing well. I understand your situation and such situations may arise in our day-to-day lives. We will have our session at 12:30 PM to take forward our conversation. Till that time, I hope you will be able to watch the videos that were shared with you.
23/1/24, 11:00 AM - +263 71 132 2777: Morning how are you sir i am watching them indeed
23/1/24, 12:24 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that! Have you gone through them now?
23/1/24, 12:32 PM - +263 71 132 2777: Yes sir i have
23/1/24, 12:40 PM - Dev Edoofa: Great! May I know about your understanding of each of the 4 videos?
23/1/24, 12:50 PM - +263 71 132 2777: Very well sir
23/1/24, 12:51 PM - Dev Edoofa: I would like you to please elaborate on what were you able to understand from each of the 4 videos?
23/1/24, 1:05 PM - +263 71 132 2777: Ok 
So from the first video i undeestood that the next step is the statement of purpose and the statement of purpose helps a student to display first impressions 
So the statement will include my documents and your recomendations from the counselling session and the statement of purpose 
The SOP is there to convince the schools why the student is worthy of the scholarship
It also includes a studen's achievements and why they choose the program
And also that when you get the form you must fill it immediately
23/1/24, 1:07 PM - +263 71 132 2777: So according to the first video i have to ask for the SOP document
23/1/24, 1:11 PM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding of the first video. Please let me know about your understanding of the remaining videos. <This message was edited>
23/1/24, 1:12 PM - +263 71 132 2777: In the second video they were now talking about the step 5,which is the university interaction 
So me as a student i need to get prepared enough for the interaction
So the faster a student watches the video the quicker they you will be prepared 
It also states the main reason for the success of the students which is the years of hard work put by admissioners you know to makes sure that the schools that their students are going to learn in are in good physical conditions 
And all the schools that a student goes there will be edoofa's EWYL program <This message was edited>
23/1/24, 1:46 PM - +263 71 132 2777: Well in the third video i was really touched by the issue of the student who lost 1300 to some thieves 
Well indeed there are others who are doing than cause they know that students in africa are desperate for better education then they use that to their own advantage 
So thats why i want to thank you administrators for your out standing job in assuring us the students on how we can rely on edoofa
Well it also talked about edoofa not only being a program that provides admissions in schools but creates a carrier opportunity to students
It also stated about having a huge vision of opportunities and not to be just based on one but to be open minded and in my own words learn to be led to the brighter future
23/1/24, 2:00 PM - +263 71 132 2777: And now the last video this one was amaizing 
I was really inspired by the 5th grader who was able to challange the status because the child saw an opportunity and decided to go for it despite the odds and that is really amazing because that is being open-minded and allowing yourself to be tought 
 This whole dialogue tought me to just following instructions and allow my superiors to teach me into the right pathway of success and achievements 
That was wonderful
23/1/24, 2:27 PM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your detailed understanding of the videos. I believe you were able to feel the essence of these videos and were able to infer the information conveyed in the video.
23/1/24, 2:39 PM - +263 71 132 2777: Certainly sir i was
23/1/24, 2:43 PM - Dev Edoofa: Brilliant, Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
23/1/24, 2:48 PM - +263 71 132 2777: Yes yes now we are moving together
23/1/24, 2:51 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, you need to complete the following tasks:
23/1/24, 2:52 PM - Dev Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

At that point, we will be prepared to move on to the third step, which involves understanding the registration process.
23/1/24, 2:54 PM - Dev Edoofa: I hope you are clear with the tasks assigned to you?

24/1/24, 3:28 PM - +263 77 544 4835: We are fine. I dont know what has happened to Caspar. He had informed me that he was going to work on the outstanding issues on Edoofa. His phone is ringinging unanswered.
24/1/24, 3:29 PM - +263 71 132 2777: How are you sir

25/1/24, 6:58 PM - +263 71 132 2777: <Media omitted>
25/1/24, 6:58 PM - +263 71 132 2777: <Media omitted>
26/1/24, 9:56 AM - Dev Edoofa: Good Afternoon Mr. and Mrs. Taruvinga and Casper!
I hope you are doing well and are having a wonderful start to the day. I felt a bit under the weather yesterday, so I took a day off to focus on my health. Today, I am feeling better and completely ready to take our conversation forward. Thank you so much for sharing the responses to the document and I have noticed that you have not filled the SOP form. We will have our session at 3:00 PM. I would like you to fill out the SOP form before our session.
26/1/24, 3:16 PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Afetrnoon Mr. and Mrs. Taruvinga and Casper!
I hope you are doing well. May I know if you are ready to take forward our conversation?
26/1/24, 3:18 PM - +263 71 132 2777: How are you sir i hope you are now doing fine
26/1/24, 3:18 PM - +263 71 132 2777: Yes am ready
26/1/24, 3:29 PM - +263 71 132 2777: <Media omitted>
26/1/24, 3:31 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am doing absolutely fine. Thank you for sharing the SOP. I have taken note of it and will update the records as well.
26/1/24, 3:31 PM - Dev Edoofa: With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey. we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*.
26/1/24, 3:31 PM - +263 71 132 2777: That is good
Ok thank you sir
26/1/24, 3:31 PM - Dev Edoofa: However, before we start the same, I was going through your scholarship application file and noticed that you are supposed to make the payment of your remaining part of Edoofa Enrollment fee. Hence, I thought of sharing a gentle reminder with you and trying to understand how your preparation has been so far? Have you been able to align your preparations in the right direction?
26/1/24, 3:33 PM - +263 71 132 2777: Yes sir i have
26/1/24, 3:43 PM - Dev Edoofa: Have you made the payment?
26/1/24, 4:16 PM - +263 77 544 4835: I will verify and if not it will be made by Tuesday.
27/1/24, 8:46 AM - Dev Edoofa: Good Morning Mr. and Mrs. Taruvinga!
I hope you are doing well. Thank you for letting me know. We will have our session at 12:30 PM to take forward our conversation . I hope you are going to be on time for that.
27/1/24, 8:46 AM - Dev Edoofa: Also, may I know if you were able to verify it?
27/1/24, 8:51 AM - +263 77 544 4835: We have verified and on  monday payment will be done. We will not be available at 1230. Caspar will be waiting for the conversation.
27/1/24, 10:15 AM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. I have taken note and informed the accounts team as well.
27/1/24, 12:43 PM - +263 71 132 2777: Afternoon sir how are you today
27/1/24, 12:47 PM - Dev Edoofa: Good afternoon Casper!
I am doing absolutely fine. What about you ?
27/1/24, 12:48 PM - +263 71 132 2777: Am doing great too 
Its good to hear that you are fine
27/1/24, 12:49 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that!
27/1/24, 12:50 PM - Dev Edoofa: Let us move forward with our discussion. To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is B.Sc (Chemistry) and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India in August 2025. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
27/1/24, 12:51 PM - +263 71 132 2777: Yes sir the information is true
27/1/24, 12:53 PM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. Based on our experience of over 14 years and having assisted over 5000 students from different countries, we have realized that financial planning is the most important factor when a student plans for their higher education abroad.
27/1/24, 12:53 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am sure that you must be aware that 20-30% of students who are admitted into universities abroad are unable to fulfill their dream and come to India due to a lack of financial planning. The funds needed for booking flights, accommodation, and covering living expenses after arrival often become overwhelming, leading to the decision to defer their admission for a year. This, in turn, creates a gap in the child's education.
27/1/24, 12:53 PM - Dev Edoofa: To assist both students and parents in this regard, Edoofa Management has designed a Financial Secure Plan that aims to help you prepare for your higher educational finances without experiencing stress or last-minute rushes. I believe you must be wondering about the details of the same plan and how it helps the parents?
27/1/24, 12:55 PM - +263 71 132 2777: Exactly i am wondering how it works
27/1/24, 12:56 PM - Dev Edoofa: Edoofa Secure Plan is important for parents who have children joining the university for tertiary education in the next one to two years for several reasons:
27/1/24, 12:56 PM - Dev Edoofa: 1. *Financial Preparedness:* The Edoofa Secure plan helps parents prepare financially for the costs after the Scholarship being offered so that they are not caught off guard.

2. *Reduced Financial Stress:* Having the Edoofa Secure Plan in place can significantly reduce the financial stress on you as parents when your child is about to enter university. Knowing that there is a dedicated fund for education expenses provides peace of mind.
27/1/24, 12:56 PM - Dev Edoofa: 3. *Avoiding Debt*: Without proper savings, some parents may resort to taking out loans or accumulating credit card debt to cover their child's education costs. This Educational savings plan helps avoid the burden of debt and high-interest payments.

4. *Compound Interest:* By starting to save early and consistently contributing to the savings plan, parents can take advantage of compound interest, which can significantly increase the amount available for education expenses.
27/1/24, 12:56 PM - Dev Edoofa: 5. *Flexibility and Control:* The Edoofa Secure savings plans allow parents to have greater control over their finances and how they allocate funds for their child's education. They can choose investment options that align with their risk tolerance and financial goals.

6. *Encouraging Responsibility*: Involving your child in the process of saving for their education teaches them financial responsibility and the value of higher education. It also motivates them to outperform in Academics.
27/1/24, 12:56 PM - Dev Edoofa: 7. *Adapting to Unexpected Changes*: Life is full of surprises, and circumstances can change especially when there are political reforms changing each day impacting the Local Currency. Having an Edoofa Secure Plan allows parents to adapt to unexpected changes in their financial situation while still prioritizing their child's education.

8. *Peace of Mind:* Overall, having the Edoofa Secure plan provides parents with peace of mind, knowing that they are actively planning for their child's future and increasing the likelihood of providing them with a solid education.
27/1/24, 12:57 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, when you go through all the above benefits, I am sure you can see that the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan is an important financial tool for parents/students who are supposed to enter the university soon. 

It helps ensure that the financial aspect of tertiary education is well-managed, reduces stress, and allows parents to provide the best opportunities for their children without resorting to debt or financial hardship. Isn't this something you and your family also wish to have?
27/1/24, 1:03 PM - +263 71 132 2777: Yes yes sir especially the issue of stress during these times we are in its not recommended at all. The peace of mind to our parents is our priority. I also wish to have the financial responsibility that i gain as a student during the tertiary education!
27/1/24, 1:08 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am happy to hear that you have such a mature mindset. Now that you have gone through the above points, do you want me to help you understand how the Edoofa Secure Plan works?
27/1/24, 1:11 PM - +263 71 132 2777: Yes sir it will be much better if you clearly explain to me
27/1/24, 1:12 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, as you are aware, we are currently in January 2024, and we have a good 20 months to plan for your finances before you start your university education in 2025.
27/1/24, 1:12 PM - Dev Edoofa: During the counseling session, you were informed that at Edoofa, we guarantee a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship on the tuition fees. Hence, the cost of education, including food and accommodation after the scholarship, would be between $2000-$3000, and it could be even less. Not more than that.
27/1/24, 1:12 PM - Dev Edoofa: This means that if you can save $150 per month for the next 20 months, you will be able to save $3000. This amount is more than enough for the first year of university fees, including tuition fees (if any), food, and accommodation. I hope you agree with this?
27/1/24, 1:15 PM - +263 71 132 2777: Yes sir it will count up to $3000
But is it a guarantee that you can be able to make $150 per month
27/1/24, 1:16 PM - Dev Edoofa: It is not about making $150 but saving $150 per month for 20 months. That's how you will save $3000. I hope you agree with this?
27/1/24, 1:18 PM - +263 71 132 2777: Ok then i understand and i agree
27/1/24, 1:19 PM - Dev Edoofa: Right, this means that by the time you would be in India, you would have already saved the $3000 that will cover the first-year fee.
27/1/24, 1:19 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, in these next 20 months, I am sure you would also be engaged in the EWYL program, and if you secure a minimum of $1000 in 20 months, that means the fees for 1.5 years are already secured.
27/1/24, 1:19 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, for a 3-year course, if we follow the same approach for the remaining 1.5 years, the educational journey for the student and the financial journey for the parent will be easy and smooth. I believe you must be able to see this perspective?
27/1/24, 1:33 PM - +263 71 132 2777: Yes sir i can see it
27/1/24, 1:35 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. With that said, there is also another benefit, I am sure being in Zimbabwe you know how drastically the exchange rate fluctuates.
27/1/24, 1:35 PM - Dev Edoofa: If you are buying a dollar today, you might be spending 7000 bonds, but if you buy a dollar after a month, the rate would be different.
27/1/24, 1:35 PM - Dev Edoofa: Also, even if you choose to buy dollars every month and save at your home, it is not safe since there is news of robbery, and mugging every day.
27/1/24, 1:35 PM - Dev Edoofa: In that case, you will opt to save in the Bank, but again we know that savings in the Bank require a Nostro Account which means you have to pay the bank to keep your money safe, right?
27/1/24, 1:36 PM - +263 71 132 2777: Yes sir that's what happens
27/1/24, 1:38 PM - Dev Edoofa: Exactly! Considering these constraints, Edoofa Management has decided to help the parents and students prepare for the journey way ahead of time by helping them save money with Edoofa without any additional charges but rather saving additional money as well. Do you want me to explain how this has been achieved?
27/1/24, 1:44 PM - +263 71 132 2777: Yes explain
27/1/24, 1:45 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Program Fee (Enrollment Fee) that you were asked to pay is $350. From the $350, you have already paid $200, and the remaining $150 is what you are planning to pay by Monday.
27/1/24, 1:45 PM - Dev Edoofa: Under the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan, a parent has to deposit a small amount of money which is $150 every month for the next 10 months. 

That means, in 10 months, the money saved will be $1500. When this money is saved, Edoofa will waive off the remaining $150 which was due from the Edoofa Program/Enrollment Fee of $350, thereby making a straight saving of $150 in 10 months.
27/1/24, 1:45 PM - Dev Edoofa: Imagine you paying $15 every month to the Bank of Zimbabwe to keep your money safe, and here Edoofa is paying you $15 every month to keep your money safe. Now, you must be wondering, why only for 10 months and not for 20 months, right?
27/1/24, 1:47 PM - +263 71 132 2777: Yes why not 20 months
27/1/24, 1:47 PM - Dev Edoofa: If you see the bigger picture, you will realize that the reason is quite simple. Upon the completion of the 10 installments, the Edoofa Admissions team will initiate the Child’s Admission Process by applying early to the universities to secure their scholarship and their university seat.
27/1/24, 1:47 PM - Dev Edoofa: Reserving seats earlier increases the chances of obtaining a maximum scholarship. A higher scholarship means lower fees, and by securing the seat, you will be entitled to pay the fees as per the old fee structure of the university, not the new one implemented in January 2025. Furthermore, when applying to the universities, you will receive an offer letter or a letter of intent detailing the fees, scholarship, and registration fees.
27/1/24, 1:47 PM - Dev Edoofa: As explained during the enrollment process, the registration fee is a portion of your first-year university fee, paid to reserve the seat. It ranges from $500-$1000 and is not an additional fee. 

From the $1500 you saved with Edoofa, the registration fee will be paid to the university, securing the seat. For instance, if the registration fee is $1000, Edoofa will pay $1000 from the $1500 saved in 10 months. The updated balance with Edoofa will be $500, which will be paid to the university upon your arrival in India.
27/1/24, 1:47 PM - Dev Edoofa: This eases the financial burden on the parent, as there is no immediate payment required upon the student's arrival. The $500 saved will cover the remaining fees for the semester/year, as specified in the offer letter from the university. What are your thoughts on this?
27/1/24, 2:05 PM - Dev Edoofa: Are you still available @263711322777?
27/1/24, 2:09 PM - +263 71 132 2777: Yes well i now understand why is for the first ten months and its an advantage for you to get a seat in the university earlier
27/1/24, 2:09 PM - +263 71 132 2777: I am sir i was just reading thoroughly
27/1/24, 2:10 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am delighted to see your sincerity, Casper.
27/1/24, 2:11 PM - Dev Edoofa: With this plan for the next 10 months, I am sure you must be wondering what will happen in the next 10 months, considering you have already secured your scholarship seat with the university due to your hard work in the first 10 months. Is my understanding correct?
27/1/24, 2:12 PM - +263 71 132 2777: Yes it is correct sir
27/1/24, 2:14 PM - Dev Edoofa: Let me help you with that as well. In the 11th month, you will be guided to open an FBC Mastercard bank account in Zimbabwe with a deposit of $150. The reason for this is that when you apply for your student Visa, the Embassy asks for a Bank Statement, and this account will serve that purpose.
27/1/24, 2:14 PM - Dev Edoofa: We understand it might be expensive if you deposit another $1500 for the remaining 10 months in FB  Bank Zimbabwe, so to avoid the same challenges, we have designed the plan accordingly. You will only be depositing for the 11th, 12th, 13th, and 14th month, which is 4 months.
27/1/24, 2:14 PM - Dev Edoofa: Once the 4 months are completed, our Department of Student Welfare (DSW) team will assist you with your visa process. The bank statement will act as one of the required documents, and once you receive the visa, you can withdraw the amount from FBC and book the flight ticket. This will help you utilize the money as well. How does it sound?
27/1/24, 2:17 PM - +263 71 132 2777: Wow its great sir 
And it sounds interesting, provided you follow the whole process according to what is said
27/1/24, 2:17 PM - Dev Edoofa: That is correct Caspar! Now, from the 16th Month till the 20th month, considering it is a 6-month window, you can again continue depositing the money ($150) with Edoofa which can be used in the fee as and when required or you can decide to save this $900 of these 6 months with you as well. This is something which you are free to choose. I hope you have understood the financial secure plan now?
27/1/24, 2:23 PM - +263 71 132 2777: Yes sir i have clearly understood
27/1/24, 2:23 PM - Dev Edoofa: That's great. Now that you have all the information, I want you to take some time and discuss the financial security plan with your family members. Help them understand its importance and details. Once you're done, we can reconnect, have a discussion, and address any queries you may have. After resolving your concerns, I'll guide you through starting your financial security plan. 

While most students can discuss this with their parents the same day, I understand everyone is different. Could you let me know when you think you'll have the discussion with your parents? This way, we can schedule our next session accordingly.
27/1/24, 2:24 PM - +263 71 132 2777: Well today my parents have traveled and they will be available tomorrow evening
27/1/24, 2:25 PM - Dev Edoofa: That's perfectly fine. In that case, we will conclude today's conversation, and I will connect with you tomorrow to resume our discussion. In the meantime, I hope you'll have a detailed discussion with your family and jot down any questions or thoughts you have regarding the Financial Secure plan.

Wishing you a good day ahead, and please extend our regards to your family.
27/1/24, 2:26 PM - +263 71 132 2777: Ok sir thank you for your time today
27/1/24, 2:26 PM - Dev Edoofa: You are most welcome!
29/1/24, 3:47 PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Casper!
I hope you are doing well and had a wonderful weekend. May I know what is the update on the payment of the remaining enrollment fee?
29/1/24, 3:52 PM - +263 77 972 6862: Good day, had a hickup today. Rest assured it will be first thing tomorrow. Very sorry for any inconviniences caused.
