With great excitement and pride, I want to share that over the past few days, the Edoofa team has been immersed in an exciting event we had in store for our students. Edoofa hosted a conference - the Symposium of Leaders, Innovators, and Creators at Edoofa, also known as 'SLICE-CON.'

The conference was attended by all the Edoofians of 2023 and a few senior Edoofians from previous batches. It focused on the art of creation, innovation, and, most importantly, the mindset required to make an impact in one's career.
12/1/24, 12:51 PM - Dev Edoofa: During this Industrial Visit and the conference - SLICE CON, Corporate leaders, such as the CEOs and Co-founders from renowned companies like Rage Coffee, Sirona Hygiene, Jolin New York, and more, shared their insights and experience. These individuals are at the helm of multi-millionaire brands, leading large marketing teams. Their presence added immense value, providing students with the opportunity to engage in transformative conversations.
12/1/24, 12:51 PM - Dev Edoofa: We believe that interactions with such industry leaders can bring significant transformations to students' lives, enhancing their business acumen. Our Edoofians maximized this opportunity, having life-changing conversations with these influential figures. The main objective of the event was to emphasize the importance of thinking outside the box, encouraging students to believe in themselves and their dreams. Before we start our session today, I wanted to share a glimpse of the event, and I hope you are excited to attend similar events when you come to India.

13/1/24, 9:15 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
13/1/24, 9:16 AM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
13/1/24, 9:17 AM - +263 77 438 4402: yes Sir
13/1/24, 9:17 AM - Dev Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
13/1/24, 9:17 AM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
13/1/24, 9:18 AM - +263 77 438 4402: yes am following
13/1/24, 9:18 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process, the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
13/1/24, 9:19 AM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
13/1/24, 9:20 AM - +263 77 438 4402: yes
13/1/24, 9:20 AM - Dev Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
13/1/24, 9:22 AM - +263 77 438 4402: yes Sir
13/1/24, 9:23 AM - Dev Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
13/1/24, 9:23 AM - Dev Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding until you are ready, shall we start with our discussion with me individually? 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
13/1/24, 9:24 AM - +263 77 438 4402: yes Sir

The third video is about Schools, Colleges, and Universities. I'm sure you're excited to learn more about the schools, colleges, and universities on the Edoofa Platform. Founders talk about their decade-long journey of discovering these schools and the experiences that students are having in these schools.

13/1/24, 9:26 AM - Dev Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP*

The fourth video is about the Statement of Purpose (SOP). The most important step towards securing a good scholarship is to write the Statement of Purpose but to know why it is important, watching this video will clear your doubts and questions.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftsGGGBYMrs&feature=youtu.be
13/1/24, 9:26 AM - Dev Edoofa: Tadiwa, I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes if you have a smooth internet connection.

17/1/24, 3:07 PM - Dev Edoofa: That is great to know! Thank you for providing the screenshot of the SOP and answers to the documents. With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey. we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*.
17/1/24, 3:11 PM - +263 77 438 4402: ok
17/1/24, 3:21 PM - Dev Edoofa: However, before we do the same, I was going through your scholarship application file and noticed that you are supposed to make the payment of your remaining part of Edoofa Enrollment fee. Hence, I thought of sharing a gentle reminder with you and trying to understand how your preparation has been so far? Have you been able to align your preparations in the right direction?
17/1/24, 3:24 PM - +263 77 438 4402: ok on that note my parents are working on that Sir am confident that they will catch up with the due date
17/1/24, 3:39 PM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. We will reconnect with each other a few days before your due date to take a follow up on this and understand your preparations better,
17/1/24, 3:40 PM - Dev Edoofa: In the meantime. Let us move forward with our discussion. To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is BA LLB and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2025. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
17/1/24, 3:40 PM - +263 77 438 4402: ok Sir
17/1/24, 3:41 PM - +263 77 438 4402: its accurate Sir
17/1/24, 3:42 PM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. Based on our experience of over 14 years and having assisted over 5000 students from different countries, we have realized that financial planning is the most important factor when a student plans for his/her higher education abroad.
17/1/24, 3:42 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am sure that you must be aware that 20-30% of students who are admitted into universities abroad are unable to fulfill their dream and come to India due to a lack of financial planning. The funds needed for booking flights, accommodation, and covering living expenses after arrival often become overwhelming, leading to the decision to defer their admission for a year. This, in turn, creates a gap in the child's education.
17/1/24, 3:42 PM - Dev Edoofa: To assist both students and parents in this regard, Edoofa Management has designed a Financial Secure Plan that aims to help you prepare for your higher educational finances without experiencing stress or last-minute rushes. I believe you must be wondering about the details of the same plan and how it helps the parents?
17/1/24, 3:44 PM - +263 77 438 4402: yes am wondering
17/1/24, 3:45 PM - Dev Edoofa: Yes, Tadiwa, I will share it with you now.
17/1/24, 3:46 PM - Dev Edoofa: Edoofa Secure Plan is important for parents who have children joining the university for tertiary education in the next one to two years for several reasons:

*Financial Preparedness:* The Edoofa Secure plan helps parents prepare financially for the costs after the Scholarship being offered so that they are not caught off guard.

*Reduced Financial Stress:* Having the Edoofa Secure Plan in place can significantly reduce the financial stress on you as parents when your child is about to enter university. Knowing that there is a dedicated fund for education expenses provides peace of mind.
17/1/24, 3:46 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Avoiding Debt*: Without proper savings, some parents may resort to taking out loans or accumulating credit card debt to cover their child's education costs. This Educational savings plan helps avoid the burden of debt and high-interest payments.

*Compound Interest:* By starting to save early and consistently contributing to the savings plan, parents can take advantage of compound interest, which can significantly increase the amount available for education expenses.
17/1/24, 3:46 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Flexibility and Control:* The Edoofa Secure savings plans allow parents to have greater control over their finances and how they allocate funds for their child's education. They can choose investment options that align with their risk tolerance and financial goals.

*Encouraging Responsibility*: Involving your child in the process of saving for their education teaches them financial responsibility and the value of higher education. It also motivates them to outperform in Academics.
17/1/24, 3:46 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Adapting to Unexpected Changes*: Life is full of surprises, and circumstances can change especially when there are political reforms changing each day impacting the Local Currency. Having an Edoofa Secure Plan allows parents to adapt to unexpected changes in their financial situation while still prioritizing their child's education.

*Peace of Mind:* Overall, having the Edoofa Secure plan provides parents with peace of mind, knowing that they are actively planning for their child's future and increasing the likelihood of providing them with a solid education.
17/1/24, 3:47 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, when you go through all the above benefits, I am sure you can see that the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan is an important financial tool for parents/students who are supposed to enter the university soon. 

It helps ensure that the financial aspect of tertiary education is well-managed, reduces stress, and allows parents to provide the best opportunities for their children without resorting to debt or financial hardship. Isn't this something you and your family also wish to have?
17/1/24, 3:48 PM - +263 77 438 4402: yes we will wish t have as a family
17/1/24, 3:56 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through the above points, do you want me to help you understand how the Edoofa Secure Plan works?
17/1/24, 4:08 PM - +263 77 438 4402: yes sir
17/1/24, 4:11 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, as you are aware, we are currently in January 2024, and we have a good 20-21 months to plan for your finances before you start your university education in 2025.
17/1/24, 4:11 PM - Dev Edoofa: During the counseling session, you were informed that at Edoofa, we guarantee a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship on the tuition fees. Hence, the cost of education, including food and accommodation after the scholarship, would be between $2000-$3000, and it could be even less. Not more than that.
17/1/24, 4:11 PM - Dev Edoofa: This means that if you can save $150 per month for the next 20 months, you will be able to save $3000. This amount is more than enough for the first year of university fees, including tuition fees (if any), food, and accommodation. I hope you agree with this?
17/1/24, 4:16 PM - +263 77 438 4402: yes I agree but as I know my parents salary that 150 will be there quarters of the salary also putting into consideration that they are still paying school fees for me and my brother which is between 12000 us per term I think it will be difficult for them Sir
17/1/24, 4:17 PM - +263 77 438 4402: three quarters of their salary
17/1/24, 4:27 PM - +263 77 438 4402: hw best can u assist me
17/1/24, 4:27 PM - Dev Edoofa: Yes, I can understand your situation @263774384402! But, May I please get to know how your preparations for your higher education have been going on? Because Edoofa Financial Secure Plan is designed to prepare you and your family to manage your finances accordingly and make sure you do not face the above-noted problems that are usually faced by students and their families. I hop you understand?
17/1/24, 4:30 PM - +263 77 438 4402: yes I understand and I was quite happy to know they is such a plan but due to the above figure I see that it might be beyond the rich of my parents
17/1/24, 5:09 PM - Dev Edoofa: I understand your concern here @263774384402, but I think it can surely be discussed with your family that if they can afford 12000 USD per term for your school, it can surely be inferred that higher education is going to cost you a certain amount as well.
17/1/24, 5:13 PM - +263 77 438 4402: yaaa the 1200 is for me and my brother sorry it was typing error its 1200
17/1/24, 5:24 PM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for letting us know. I have taken a note of it. But, I want you to understand that if your school fees are around this much, it is quite understandable that your higher education is going to be more than that. So may I know how your parents are preparing for finances to pay the fees of your tertiary education here in India? <This message was edited>
17/1/24, 5:40 PM - +263 77 438 4402: ok Sir but what I really know is that their salary is around 200us so to avoid stressing them as a girl child and a first born child I usually put myself in their shoes and try to work with their earnings and I also consider they have may little siblings t take car of

18/1/24, 4:36 PM - +263 77 438 4402: ok ok Sir it ok let's discuss
18/1/24, 4:41 PM - Dev Edoofa: That is good to know. Now, picking up from our last conversation, you would have already saved the $3000 that will cover the first-year fee, if you deposit $150 every month for the next 20 months, right?
18/1/24, 5:29 PM - +263 77 438 4402: yes
19/1/24, 10:13 AM - Dev Edoofa: Good Morning @263774384402!

19/1/24, 3:34 PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Afternoon @263774384402 !
I hope you are doing well. We have our session right now. May I know if you are ready to take forward our session?
19/1/24, 3:47 PM - +263 77 438 4402: am ready sir
19/1/24, 3:50 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that!
19/1/24, 3:51 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now from our yesterday's conversation, it means that by the time you are in India, you will have already saved the $3000 that will cover the first-year fee.
19/1/24, 3:51 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, in these next 20 months, I am sure you would also be engaged in the EWYL program, and if you secure a minimum of $1000 in 20 months, that means the fees for 1.5 years are already secured.
19/1/24, 3:51 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, for a 3-year course, if we follow the same approach for the remaining 1.5 years, the educational journey for the student and the financial journey for the parent will be easy and smooth. I believe you must be able to see this perspective?
19/1/24, 3:53 PM - +263 77 438 4402: yes Sir
19/1/24, 3:58 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. With that said, there is also another benefit, I am sure being in Zimbabwe you know how drastically the exchange rate fluctuates.
19/1/24, 3:58 PM - Dev Edoofa: If you are buying a dollar today, you might be spending 7000 bonds, but if you buy a dollar after a month, the rate would be different.
19/1/24, 3:59 PM - Dev Edoofa: Also, even if you choose to buy dollars every month and save at your home, it is not safe since there is news of robbery, and mugging every day.
19/1/24, 3:59 PM - Dev Edoofa: In that case, you will opt to save in the Bank, but again we know that savings in the Bank require a Nostro Account which means you have to pay the bank to keep your money safe, right?
19/1/24, 4:03 PM - +263 77 438 4402: yes u need a nostro account
19/1/24, 4:07 PM - Dev Edoofa: That is great to hear, considering these constraints, Edoofa Management has decided to help the parents and students prepare for the journey way ahead of time by helping them save money with Edoofa without any additional charges but rather saving additional money as well. Do you want me to explain how this has been achieved?
19/1/24, 4:08 PM - +263 77 438 4402: yes Sir
19/1/24, 4:10 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Program Fee (Enrollment Fee) that you were asked to pay is $350. From the $350, you have already paid $200, and the remaining $150 is what you are planning to pay by tomorrow before your due date of 28-January-2024.
19/1/24, 4:10 PM - Dev Edoofa: Under the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan, a parent has to deposit a small amount of money which is $150 every month for the next 10 months. 

That means, in 10 months, the money saved will be $1500. When this money is saved, Edoofa will waive off the remaining $150 which was due from the Edoofa Program/Enrollment Fee of $350, thereby making a straight saving of $150 in 10 months.
19/1/24, 4:10 PM - Dev Edoofa: Imagine you paying $15 every month to the Bank of Zimbabwe to keep your money safe, and here Edoofa is paying you $15 every month to keep your money safe. Now, you must be wondering, why only for 10 months and not for 20 months, right?
19/1/24, 4:18 PM - +263 77 438 4402: ye am wondering
19/1/24, 4:20 PM - Dev Edoofa: If you see the bigger picture, you will realize that the reason is quite simple. Upon the completion of the 10 installments, the Edoofa Admissions team will initiate the Child’s Admission Process by applying early to the universities to secure their scholarship and their university seat.
19/1/24, 4:20 PM - Dev Edoofa: Reserving seats earlier increases the chances of obtaining a maximum scholarship. A higher scholarship means lower fees, and by securing the seat, you will be entitled to pay the fees as per the old fee structure of the university, not the new one implemented in January 2025. Furthermore, when applying to the universities, you will receive an offer letter or a letter of intent detailing the fees, scholarship, and registration fee.
19/1/24, 4:20 PM - Dev Edoofa: As explained during the enrollment process, the registration fee is a portion of your first-year university fee, paid to reserve the seat. It ranges from $500-$1000 and is not an additional fee. 

From the $1500 you saved with Edoofa, the registration fee will be paid to the university, securing the seat. For instance, if the registration fee is $1000, Edoofa will pay $1000 from the $1500 saved in 10 months. The updated balance with Edoofa will be $500, which will be paid to the university upon your arrival in India.
19/1/24, 4:20 PM - Dev Edoofa: This eases the financial burden on the parent, as there is no immediate payment required upon the student's arrival. The $500 saved will cover the remaining fees for the semester/year, as specified in the offer letter from the university. What are your thoughts on this?
19/1/24, 4:22 PM - +263 77 438 4402: I understand
19/1/24, 4:23 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to see that we are together so far. With this plan for the next 10 months, I am sure you must be wondering what will happen in the next 10 months, considering you have already secured your scholarship seat with the university due to your hard work in the first 10 months. Is my understanding correct?
19/1/24, 4:23 PM - +263 77 438 4402: yes Sir
19/1/24, 4:25 PM - Dev Edoofa: Let me help you with that as well. In the 11th month, you will be guided to open an FBC Mastercard bank account in Zimbabwe with a deposit of $150. The reason for this is that when you apply for your student Visa, the Embassy asks for a Bank Statement, and this account will serve that purpose.
19/1/24, 4:25 PM - Dev Edoofa: We understand it might be expensive if you deposit another $1500 for the remaining 10 months in FB  Bank Zimbabwe, so to avoid the same challenges, we have designed the plan accordingly. You will only be depositing for the 11th, 12th, 13th, and 14th month, which is 4 months.
19/1/24, 4:25 PM - Dev Edoofa: Once the 4 months are completed, our Department of Student Welfare (DSW) team will assist you with your visa process. The bank statement will act as one of the required documents, and once you receive the visa, you can withdraw the amount from FBC and book the flight ticket. This will help you utilize the money as well. How does it sound?
19/1/24, 4:27 PM - +263 77 438 4402: yaaa it sounds great
19/1/24, 4:28 PM - Dev Edoofa: Yes, indeed! Now, from the 16th Month till the 20th month, considering it is a 6-month window, you can again continue depositing the money ($150) with Edoofa which can be used in the fee as and when required or you can decide to save this $900 of these 6 months with you as well. This is something which you are free to choose. I hope you understand the financial secure plan now?
19/1/24, 4:29 PM - +263 77 438 4402: yes I understand
19/1/24, 4:30 PM - Dev Edoofa: That's great. Now that you have all the information, I want you to take some time and discuss the financial security plan with your family members. Help them understand its importance and details. Once you're done, we can reconnect, have a discussion, and address any queries you may have. After resolving your concerns, I'll guide you through starting your financial security plan. 

While most students can discuss this with their parents the same day, I understand everyone is different.
19/1/24, 4:33 PM - +263 77 438 4402: yes maybe by Sunday we could have discussed with my family
19/1/24, 4:33 PM - Dev Edoofa: That's perfectly fine. In that case, we will conclude today's conversation, and I will connect with you on Monday to resume our discussion. In the meantime, I hope you'll have a detailed discussion with your family and jot down any questions or thoughts you have regarding the Financial Secure plan.

Wishing you a good day ahead, and please extend our regards to your family.
19/1/24, 4:35 PM - +263 77 438 4402: thanks u Sir I will
19/1/24, 6:07 PM - Dev Edoofa: You are most welcome!
22/1/24, 10:56 AM - Dev Edoofa: Good Morning Mr. and Mr. Mahana!
I hope you are doing well. We will reconnect at 4:30 PM to take forward our conversation today. Till then I wish you have a great day ahead!
22/1/24, 11:13 AM - +263 77 438 4402: good morning Sir ok Sir
22/1/24, 4:40 PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Afternoon Mr. and Mrs. Mahana and Tadiwa!
I hope you are doing well. We have our session right now. May I know if you are ready to take forward our conversation?
22/1/24, 4:45 PM - +263 77 438 4402: yes Sir good afternoon Sir
22/1/24, 5:06 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to see that you are ready for our session. May I know if you have discussed the Edoofa Secure Plan with your family?
22/1/24, 5:55 PM - +263 77 438 4402: yes we have discussed but they were saying the plan was quite good but the fact that their salaries are so low so the plan is beyond their capacity
22/1/24, 6:36 PM - Dev Edoofa: I understand you and your parents' concern @263774384402. But I would like you to please help me understand that since you are not going to be able to pay $150 per month so, how are your parents planning to prepare for your finances for your higher education? As you know your per year fees for your higher education in India are going to be around $2000-$3000. So if you are not able to prepare for it, how are you going to manage for the same?

That is why we proposed this plan so that it is ensured that after enrolling in the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan, you are able to come to India and not become part of that 20 - 30 % of students who are unable to because of poor financial preparations.
22/1/24, 6:42 PM - +263 77 438 4402: I don't know Sir
23/1/24, 8:59 PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Evening Mr. and Mrs. Mahana and Tadiwa! 
I hope you are doing well. I understand the concern that Tadiwa is enlightening with, however, I would like the parents to actively take part in these discussions because ultimately parents have to decide and prepare the finances of students. I hope that in our next session, parents will also participate. We will reconnect tomorrow at 4:00 PM. Till then I wish you a good night!
24/1/24, 4:06 PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Evening Mr. and Mrs. Mahana and Tadiwa!
I hope you are doing well.  I'd like to assist you in getting started with your EWYL Journey. Since the EWYL session was not started timely, you were scheduled to take forward your EWYL journey on 23rd January 2024.
24/1/24, 4:07 PM - Dev Edoofa: We have already communicated this information to the EWYL team. They are prepared to initiate your EWYL program on Tuesday. 

To kick start the process, your dedicated EWYL Mentor has established your EWYL Group and shared the invitation link with us. Here's what you and your parents/guardian/sponsor need to do:

I hope you are doing well and are having a wonderful start to the day. May I know if you as parents were able to discuss the Edoofa Secure Plan and it's beneficial aspects?
27/1/24, 10:18 AM - +263 77 438 4402: yes we have discussed but we are finding it challenging.The suggested figures will take the greater chuck of our earnings leaving us with very little for our upkeep and fees for Tadiwa's siblings.Cannot we save using our own methods and then pay the needed amount in full or any other agreed payment plans when needed
30/1/24, 11:08 AM - Dev Edoofa: Good Morning Mr. & Mrs. Mahana and Tadiwa!

30/1/24, 3:41 PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Tadiwa

I hope you are doing well. I was expecting a response from your end today and hence I wanted to reach out to you once again and see if we are still connected. 

At the same time, I was going through your application file and as per the same, you are supposed to make the payment of your remaining part of the Edoofa Enrollment fee of $150 before 28 January 2024. 

In light of this, I wanted to reach out to you, share a gentle reminder, and try to understand if you have been able to make the payment of your fee by now so that we can update the academic board accordingly?
30/1/24, 3:47 PM - +263 77 438 4402: its true we are trying to make ends meet so that we may pay the remaining amount
