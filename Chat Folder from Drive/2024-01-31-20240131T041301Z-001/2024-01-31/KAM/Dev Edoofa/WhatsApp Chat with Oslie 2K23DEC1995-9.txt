28/12/23, 8:05 AM - +263 77 453 2562: But the issue here is 1.Oslie is in boarding school and from the 8th of January she will be going back to school and phones are not allowed.
Oslie is yet to register for Alevel examinations and they usually do so around March so I don't know how she can proceed with the EWYL program
28/12/23, 8:15 AM - Dev Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Oslie!

In regards to her availability for the EWYL program, we have taken this situation into our notice and will get back to you with a viable solution.

I hope I was able to clear your doubts?

EWYL sessions are online sessions that are designed in such a way that they can be easily squeezed into daily day to day schedule of a student. So, no need to worry about this, it will not affect Oslie's school performance.

8/1/24, 8:54 PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Oslie!
I hope all of you are doing great. While I was wrapping up my day, I observed that we were not able to have a smooth discussion for the past couple of days, which has led to some delay in the admission process. We are aware of your immense trust in us and we surely care about your future. Considering that in mind, I wanted to schedule a specific session tomorrow at 8:30 am so that we can cover the process we are lagging behind,  and ensure that your admission process is on track. Hence, I wanted to understand if you will be available for our session at 8:30am. If not, I would like you to please let me know at what time between 8:30 am to 4 pm will you be available?
8/1/24, 8:55 PM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the document. I have taken note of this and will update it in our records.
8/1/24, 9:18 PM - +263 77 453 2562: Oslie is already in school now .she will be available in April
8/1/24, 9:19 PM - +263 77 453 2562: Good day
8/1/24, 9:33 PM - Dev Edoofa: No worries, Mrs.Tsuro. I completely understand. So, what we can do is that since Oslie is going to be unavailable because of her school, I would highly recommend you to take part in these sessions actively, as a delay in these processes will further hamper Oslie's admission process. And we never want that to happen. So, may I please what do you feel about this solution?
8/1/24, 9:34 PM - +263 77 453 2562: I will do it on her behalf.tommorow 1300

9/1/24, 1:26 PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Oslie!
I hope all of you are having a wonderful day ahead. We are excited to take forward the admission process and I trust that you are excited as well. Before starting our session, may I please know how are you all doing today?

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
9/1/24, 1:45 PM - +263 77 453 2562: Okay

9/1/24, 2:10 PM - Dev Edoofa: I completely understand what you are trying to say, Mr. Tsuro. But, there is one thing that needs to be understood if we give all the information regarding the admission process, it will be too much to understand and it may, in turn, hamper the admission process. Therefore, we would request you to please be free for one hour at least so as to smoothly proceed with the process. I hope you understand?
9/1/24, 2:10 PM - +263 77 455 2095: It's ok

9/1/24, 2:16 PM - Dev Edoofa: I completely understand, Mr.Tsuro. In that case, we can conclude our session for today. We are going to take forward our session tomorrow. I hope you have a great day ahead!
9/1/24, 2:16 PM - +263 77 455 2095: What time
9/1/24, 2:30 PM - Dev Edoofa: We will let you know soon.
9/1/24, 2:38 PM - +263 77 453 2562: But we didn't do anything today we had spared that hour for today
9/1/24, 3:10 PM - Dev Edoofa: Yes, that is absolutely correct @263774532562 . The agenda for today's conversation was to help you understand the process Oslie will undertake for his university admission journey and what your family will be experiencing with the Edoofa Scholarship Program over the next one and a half years. However, since Oslie is in school and you are occupied with work during the day, it seems that the same challenge is going to persist for the next couple of months as well.

If I were in your position, I too would have sought all the information at once to stay updated, and then this challenge could have been avoided. However, @263774532562 i, if you consider, our goal is to help you prepare for your child's education abroad, and that is something that cannot be done over a brief discussion. It requires months of planning. Hence, to do that perfectly and be prepared, as a parent, you too would have to contribute an hour daily for at least 10 days so that we can be in sync and make the right decisions.

With that being said, what we can do right now is give you the freedom to choose the time slot for our sessions over the next 10 days [till 20th January]. This way, we can align it with our availability as well and help you move forward and make progress in a streamlined manner. Could you please let me know at what time you would be available from Monday to Friday between 08:00 AM and 06:00 PM? This would help us factor in your inputs and find the right time for our sessions. <This message was edited>
9/1/24, 3:13 PM - +263 77 453 2562: I think from 4pm to 6 pm would be ideal
9/1/24, 3:33 PM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know and I have taken note of the time slot that will be most suitable for you. Kindly provide me some time to realign my schedule according to your availability and then I will share my confirmation. Till the time, please be patient and allow us some time.
15/1/24, 9:43 PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Evening Oslie and Parents! I hope all of you are doing great. I am doing good as well. To ensure a smooth admission process, we will have our session at 4:00 PM tomorrow to take forward our conversation. I hope you will have a good internet connection and will be to attend this session. We will further connect in our session tomorrow! Wish you a blessed night.
16/1/24, 9:53 AM - +263 77 453 2562: Thank you
16/1/24, 4:08 PM - +263 77 453 2562: Good afternoon
16/1/24, 4:12 PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Afternoon Mrs. Tsuro!
How are you all doing?
16/1/24, 4:12 PM - +263 77 453 2562: Fine hw are you
16/1/24, 4:13 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am doing good as well. Thank you for asking.
16/1/24, 4:13 PM - Dev Edoofa: Shall we move forward with our session?
16/1/24, 4:13 PM - +263 77 453 2562: Yes
16/1/24, 4:14 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that! Moving forward in our today’s session, we will discuss a bit about your university admission journey. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts. I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them.

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
16/1/24, 4:14 PM - +263 77 453 2562: Yes
16/1/24, 4:15 PM - Dev Edoofa: <Media omitted>
16/1/24, 4:17 PM - +263 77 453 2562: I've read it.but can one get admission in university before A level results
16/1/24, 4:22 PM - Dev Edoofa: No, Mrs. Tsuro. It is not possible.
16/1/24, 4:23 PM - +263 77 453 2562: Okay
16/1/24, 4:26 PM - +263 77 453 2562: You may proceed
16/1/24, 4:32 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
16/1/24, 4:32 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
16/1/24, 4:33 PM - +263 77 453 2562: Clear sir
16/1/24, 4:35 PM - Dev Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
16/1/24, 4:35 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
16/1/24, 4:38 PM - +263 77 453 2562: Following
16/1/24, 4:44 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process, the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
16/1/24, 4:44 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
16/1/24, 4:46 PM - +263 77 453 2562: Well understood
16/1/24, 4:46 PM - Dev Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
16/1/24, 4:46 PM - +263 77 453 2562: Yess
16/1/24, 4:52 PM - Dev Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
16/1/24, 4:52 PM - Dev Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding until you are ready, shall we start with our discussion with me individually? 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
16/1/24, 4:53 PM - +263 77 453 2562: Okay
16/1/24, 4:55 PM - +263 77 453 2562: Okay
16/1/24, 5:00 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students*

This is a video by the founders of EDOOFA, in which they share 2 important qualities of successful Edoofians- who've secured a maximum scholarship and earned scholarship credits.

https://youtu.be/SIh6DcQsqYM
16/1/24, 5:00 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s vision for you*

This is another video of the founders, where they share the vision of Edoofa at a core level. Founders also talk more about the most important character trait that distinguishes a successful student from the rest of the crowd.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q44qkd4wc7o
16/1/24, 5:00 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

The third video is about Schools, Colleges, and Universities. I'm sure you're excited to learn more about the schools, colleges, and universities on the Edoofa Platform. Founders talk about their decade-long journey of discovering these schools and the experiences that students are having in these schools.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DW82emflFHw&feature=youtu.be
16/1/24, 5:00 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP*

The fourth video is about the Statement of Purpose (SOP). The most important step towards securing a good scholarship is to write the Statement of Purpose but to know why it is important, watching this video will clear your doubts and questions.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftsGGGBYMrs&feature=youtu.be
16/1/24, 5:01 PM - Dev Edoofa: Mrs. Tsuro, I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection. 

Please go through the 4 videos, our next session will be scheduled after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarize your understanding. We will connect tomorrow at the same time.
16/1/24, 5:02 PM - +263 77 453 2562: Ky thank you will update you tomorrow
16/1/24, 5:08 PM - Dev Edoofa: That is wonderful to hear. In that case, we will be concluding the conversation for now and we will reconnect tomorrow at 4:00 pm for our next session. 

I hope by then you will be able to go through the videos. If you have any queries or concerns before then, feel free to share them here in your admission group. Wish you a blessed evening and please ensure to extend our regards to your family as well. <This message was edited>

27/1/24, 1:30 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that! Now that you have watched the videos, may I know about your understanding of each of the 4 videos that were shared with you?
28/1/24, 11:18 AM - +263 77 453 2562: 1.Successful edoofians should be able to follow instructions and also be open minded

Since SOP is an important document the student should be prompt in taking action and be deligent in filling out the form
29/1/24, 10:30 AM - Dev Edoofa: Good Morning Mr. and Mrs. Tsuro!
I hope you are doing well and had a wonderful weekend. Thank you for providing a detailed understanding of the 4 videos. I believe that you were able to feel the essence of the videos and grasp the information that was being conveyed. . Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.
29/1/24, 10:31 AM - Dev Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move Oslie's application ahead and help Oslie write a proper statement of purpose so that she can get into the best University that provides quality education that leads to a Job. So, for the team to work on Oslie's application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, we would require Oslie's availability for approximately 30 minutes. If she is unavailable, she can provide you with her input, and you can proceed with the statement of purpose on her behalf.
29/1/24, 10:33 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in Oslie's admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

https://goo.gl/forms/iWss6zPuOFbnGTXK2
29/1/24, 10:40 AM - Dev Edoofa: Once you share the screenshot of the filled online form that has been provided to you, we will have completed the second step of your university admission process. At that point, we will be prepared to move on to the third step, which involves Introduction to the Financial Secure Plan. Hence, could you kindly confirm when you will be able to complete these tasks and reconnect with us? This will allow us to schedule our discussion accordingly.
29/1/24, 2:16 PM - +263 77 453 2562: Unfortunately I've no communication with oslie at the moment.she will be at school.the only time she will be available is in April during the school vacation so I do not know how we are going to proceed under those circumstances
29/1/24, 2:43 PM - Dev Edoofa: Thanks for letting me know. I have taken note of it and completely understand this genuine concern. Oslie can complete the tasks once she is back. Now, may I know if you are available to take forward our session?
29/1/24, 3:55 PM - +263 77 453 2562: Yes I am
29/1/24, 4:07 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that! With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey. we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. counseling on university admission.
29/1/24, 4:07 PM - Dev Edoofa: With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey. we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. counseling on university admission.
29/1/24, 4:08 PM - +263 77 453 2562: Ky
29/1/24, 4:20 PM - Dev Edoofa: However, before we start the same, I was going through your scholarship application file and noticed that you were supposed to make the payment of the remaining part of the Edoofa Enrollment fee on 26th January. Hence, I thought of sharing a gentle reminder with you and trying to understand if you are facing any issues or challenges in doing so?
29/1/24, 4:30 PM - +263 77 453 2562: It was paid
29/1/24, 4:31 PM - Dev Edoofa: May I please ask you to share the receipt for the same?
29/1/24, 4:32 PM - +263 77 453 2562: It was paid through Mr jerera's account
29/1/24, 4:32 PM - +263 77 453 2562: Will ask Mr Tsuro to share the same since he is the one in possession of the copy
29/1/24, 4:39 PM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. Please make sure that you can share the receipt as soon as possible.
29/1/24, 4:40 PM - Dev Edoofa: In the meantime, Let us move forward with our discussion. To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is B.Sc (Cardiovascular Technology) and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India in August 2025. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
29/1/24, 4:41 PM - +263 77 453 2562: Correct 💯
29/1/24, 4:42 PM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. Based on our experience of over 14 years and having assisted over 5000 students from different countries, we have realized that financial planning is the most important factor when a student plans for their higher education abroad.
29/1/24, 4:42 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am sure that you must be aware that 20-30% of students who are admitted into universities abroad are unable to fulfill their dream and come to India due to a lack of financial planning. The funds needed for booking flights, accommodation, and covering living expenses after arrival often become overwhelming, leading to the decision to defer their admission for a year. This, in turn, creates a gap in the child's education.
29/1/24, 4:42 PM - Dev Edoofa: To assist both students and parents in this regard, Edoofa Management has designed a Financial Secure Plan that aims to help you prepare for your higher educational finances without experiencing stress or last-minute rushes. I believe you must be wondering about the details of the same plan and how it helps the parents?
29/1/24, 4:47 PM - +263 77 453 2562: Will be glad if you could explain more
29/1/24, 4:48 PM - Dev Edoofa: Edoofa Secure Plan is important for parents who have children joining the university for tertiary education in the next one to two years for several reasons:
29/1/24, 4:48 PM - Dev Edoofa: 1. *Financial Preparedness:* The Edoofa Secure plan helps parents prepare financially for the costs after the Scholarship being offered so that they are not caught off guard.

2. *Reduced Financial Stress:* Having the Edoofa Secure Plan in place can significantly reduce the financial stress on you as parents when your child is about to enter university. Knowing that there is a dedicated fund for education expenses provides peace of mind.
29/1/24, 4:48 PM - Dev Edoofa: 3. *Avoiding Debt*: Without proper savings, some parents may resort to taking out loans or accumulating credit card debt to cover their child's education costs. This Educational savings plan helps avoid the burden of debt and high-interest payments.

4. *Compound Interest:* By starting to save early and consistently contributing to the savings plan, parents can take advantage of compound interest, which can significantly increase the amount available for education expenses.
29/1/24, 4:48 PM - Dev Edoofa: 5. *Flexibility and Control:* The Edoofa Secure savings plans allow parents to have greater control over their finances and how they allocate funds for their child's education. They can choose investment options that align with their risk tolerance and financial goals.

6. *Encouraging Responsibility*: Involving your child in the process of saving for their education teaches them financial responsibility and the value of higher education. It also motivates them to outperform in Academics.
29/1/24, 4:48 PM - Dev Edoofa: 7. *Adapting to Unexpected Changes*: Life is full of surprises, and circumstances can change especially when there are political reforms changing each day impacting the Local Currency. Having an Edoofa Secure Plan allows parents to adapt to unexpected changes in their financial situation while still prioritizing their child's education.

8. *Peace of Mind:* Overall, having the Edoofa Secure plan provides parents with peace of mind, knowing that they are actively planning for their child's future and increasing the likelihood of providing them with a solid education.
29/1/24, 4:48 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, when you go through all the above benefits, I am sure you can see that the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan is an important financial tool for parents/students who are supposed to enter the university soon. 

It helps ensure that the financial aspect of tertiary education is well-managed, reduces stress, and allows parents to provide the best opportunities for their children without resorting to debt or financial hardship. Isn't this something you and your family also wish to have?
29/1/24, 4:53 PM - +263 77 453 2562: True but how do we achieve that
29/1/24, 4:56 PM - Dev Edoofa: Let me help you with it,  as you are aware, we are currently in January 2024, and we have a good 20 months to plan for your finances before you start your university education in 2025.
29/1/24, 4:56 PM - Dev Edoofa: During the counseling session, you were informed that at Edoofa, we guarantee a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship on the tuition fees. Hence, the cost of education, including food and accommodation after the scholarship, would be between $2000-$3000, and it could be even less. Not more than that.
29/1/24, 4:56 PM - Dev Edoofa: This means that if you can save $150 per month for the next 20 months, you will be able to save $3000. This amount is more than enough for the first year of university fees, including tuition fees (if any), food, and accommodation. I hope you agree with this?
29/1/24, 4:59 PM - +263 77 453 2562: <Media omitted>
29/1/24, 5:01 PM - +263 77 453 2562: I'm realizing that the transfer fee of 12.5% was not paid since we paid through Mr Jerera's account how do I rectify that.
29/1/24, 5:37 PM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the receipt. I have taken note of it and updated the accounts team as well. I will let you know if there is any update regarding this.
29/1/24, 5:38 PM - Dev Edoofa: shall we move ahead?
29/1/24, 5:42 PM - +263 77 453 2562: True
29/1/24, 5:42 PM - +263 77 453 2562: Yes
29/1/24, 5:58 PM - Dev Edoofa: Right, this means that by the time you would be in India, you would have already saved the $3000 that will cover the first-year fee.
29/1/24, 5:58 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, in these next 20 months, I am sure you would also be engaged in the EWYL program, and if you secure a minimum of $1000 in 20 months, that means the fees for 1.5 years are already secured.
29/1/24, 5:58 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, for a 3-year course, if we follow the same approach for the remaining 1.5 years, the educational journey for the student and the financial journey for the parent will be easy and smooth. I believe you must be able to see this perspective?
29/1/24, 7:19 PM - +263 77 453 2562: Yes I do
30/1/24, 10:44 AM - Dev Edoofa: Good Afternoon Mr. and Mrs. Tsuro!
I hope you are doing well. Since we were not able to take forward our session yesterday, as our operational hours were over. We will take forward our discussion at 4:00 PM. Till then, I want to assist you in getting started with your EWYL Journey. Since there was a delay in initiating the EWYL program, the EWYL team is prepared to initiate your EWYL program today, i.e. 30th January. 

To kick-start the process, your dedicated EWYL Mentor has established your EWYL Group and shared the invitation link with us. Here's what you and your parents/guardian/sponsor need to do:
30/1/24, 10:46 AM - Dev Edoofa: https://chat.whatsapp.com/KT7FXSvAl0qBRwtYgxZeKI

"Use the above-provided link to join your group. Once both you and your parents have joined, please send the following message to the group:

*Dear Mentor, my name is Oslie Reason Tsuro, and my EWYL group name is Oslie EWYL23E1096. I am excited to begin my EWYL Journey. As discussed with the admission team, I am committed to being available on 30/12/1899 to commence the procedures. Kindly schedule my session for the same date so that I can maximize the benefits and start on the right track.*"
30/1/24, 10:46 AM - Dev Edoofa: Once you start with the EWYL Program and are able to connect with your mentor, please update the same here as well by sending the below message -

*Hello Admission officer, I am now in touch with my EWYL Mentor. The name of my Mentor is _________ and he/she has scheduled my session for ________*(mention the date)
30/1/24, 10:46 AM - Dev Edoofa: I hope these instructions are clear?
30/1/24, 3:26 PM - +263 77 453 2562: They are let me verify with oslie's teachers if she can have access to internet for the EWYL program
30/1/24, 3:52 PM - Dev Edoofa: Thanks for letting me know about this, but I believe the parents can also attend the EWYL sessions initially to ensure that the student's EWYL journey is not affected and can self-finance their education in a better way.
30/1/24, 4:32 PM - +263 77 453 2562: It's okay. I thought the EWYL is strictly for the student
30/1/24, 4:35 PM - Dev Edoofa: It is for the student but the parents can also participate in these sessions, which will only help the student only.
30/1/24, 4:36 PM - Dev Edoofa: Also, we were discussing the Edoofa Secure Plan yesterday, may I know if you are available to take forward our session? <This message was edited>
30/1/24, 4:37 PM - +263 77 453 2562: Yes
30/1/24, 4:38 PM - Dev Edoofa: That's great!
30/1/24, 4:39 PM - Dev Edoofa: May I know if you were able to see this perspective yesterday?
30/1/24, 4:40 PM - +263 77 453 2562: Yes I did understand that if we manage to save $150 per month for the next 20moths it will be enough to cater for the first year
30/1/24, 4:41 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that we are on the same page.  With that said, there is also another benefit, I am sure being in Zimbabwe you know how drastically the exchange rate fluctuates.
30/1/24, 4:41 PM - Dev Edoofa: If you are buying a dollar today, you might be spending 7000 bonds, but if you buy a dollar after a month, the rate would be different.
30/1/24, 4:41 PM - Dev Edoofa: Also, even if you choose to buy dollars every month and save at your home, it is not safe since there is news of robbery, and mugging every day.
30/1/24, 4:41 PM - Dev Edoofa: In that case, you will opt to save in the Bank, but again we know that savings in the Bank require a Nostro Account which means you have to pay the bank to keep your money safe, right?
30/1/24, 4:50 PM - +263 77 453 2562: True
30/1/24, 4:54 PM - Dev Edoofa: That is great to hear, considering these constraints, Edoofa Management has decided to help the parents and students prepare for the journey way ahead of time by helping them save money with Edoofa without any additional charges but rather saving additional money as well. Do you want me to explain how this has been achieved?
30/1/24, 5:17 PM - +263 77 453 2562: Go ahead
30/1/24, 5:21 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Program Fee (Enrollment Fee) that you were asked to pay is $350.
30/1/24, 5:21 PM - Dev Edoofa: Under the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan, a parent has to deposit a small amount of money which is $150 every month for the next 10 months. 

That means, in 10 months, the money saved will be $1500.
30/1/24, 5:21 PM - Dev Edoofa: Imagine you paying $15 every month to the Bank of Zimbabwe to keep your money safe, and here Edoofa is paying you $15 every month to keep your money safe. Now, you must be wondering, why only for 10 months and not for 20 months, right?
30/1/24, 5:25 PM - +263 77 453 2562: Ky
30/1/24, 5:27 PM - Dev Edoofa: If you see the bigger picture, you will realize that the reason is quite simple. Upon the completion of the 10 installments, the Edoofa Admissions team will initiate the Child’s Admission Process by applying early to the universities to secure their scholarship and their university seat.
30/1/24, 5:27 PM - Dev Edoofa: Reserving seats earlier increases the chances of obtaining a maximum scholarship. A higher scholarship means lower fees, and by securing the seat, you will be entitled to pay the fees as per the old fee structure of the university, not the new one implemented in January 2025. Furthermore, when applying to the universities, you will receive an offer letter or a letter of intent detailing the fees, scholarship, and registration fees.
30/1/24, 5:27 PM - Dev Edoofa: As explained during the enrollment process, the registration fee is a portion of your first-year university fee, paid to reserve the seat. It ranges from $500-$1000 and is not an additional fee. 

From the $1500 you saved with Edoofa, the registration fee will be paid to the university, securing the seat. For instance, if the registration fee is $1000, Edoofa will pay $1000 from the $1500 saved in 10 months. The updated balance with Edoofa will be $500, which will be paid to the university upon your arrival in India.
30/1/24, 5:27 PM - Dev Edoofa: This eases the financial burden on the parent, as there is no immediate payment required upon the student's arrival. The $500 saved will cover the remaining fees for the semester/year, as specified in the offer letter from the university. What are your thoughts on this?
30/1/24, 7:25 PM - +263 77 453 2562: I  will be saving and keeping the money from this side
