16/1/24, 12:15 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Panashe 

I trust this message finds you well, and I hope you are in high spirits. In recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their A-Level results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey.
16/1/24, 12:16 PM - Ashi Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?
24/1/24, 9:26 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Greetings dear parents and Panashe
*I am Mr Austin, Senior Career Counsellor at Edoofa*
I hope you all are doing well

If you recall, I hosted your counselling and evaluation sessions, and you made me proud by qualifying for our prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program. I received results from all my students, happy and exhilarating with joy. Recalling our interaction together after a frantic search for your name I ended up messaging you today. I understand your calibre and had a discussion with the Admissions Head and have decided to *personally look after your admission process so that we can proceed with your application on priority through the best possible opportunities and exposures.*

Hence, I request you to come online at *12:00 pm CAT today* and notify on this platform so that I can guide you ahead.
24/1/24, 12:21 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Greetings to you all!
I am here to guide you through the further proceedings of the program and guide you ahead

Are you available to begin?

29/1/24, 9:31 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Good to hear that, Mr Mututu!
 I am doing well by the Grace of God
29/1/24, 9:31 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: We celebrated the 75th Republic day of India on Friday and was unavailable in the weekend due to which I was unable to get back to you.

Are you available today for a short discussion?
29/1/24, 7:26 PM - +263 77 854 2238: Yes please.

30/1/24, 12:01 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Good to hear from you, Mr Chrispen!
30/1/24, 12:02 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: At the same time, I was going through your Admissions Group and was shocked to see that you weren't able to complete the University registration process while Panashe being a bright student and I still remember his passion for career and goals, making you him of my favourite students. I personally had a discussion with the Admissions Head and have decided to help you in the best possible way as I understand your calibre.  

May I know, what are the challenges due to which you weren't able to proceed and what are your plans as of now?

30/1/24, 12:12 PM - +263 77 854 2238: The only challenge which we faced previously was of money but right now are working on that and believe is going to meet the dates of coming there August.
30/1/24, 12:25 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: This is well noted, Mr Chrispen and I am here to discuss with you regarding the same so that I can guide you through the most affordable and best opportunities for your child!
30/1/24, 12:25 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: At the same time, do you know we at EDOOFA received 2000 Applications in a Single Day just a week before and each day since then we are receiving not less than 1000 Applications each day from students seeking Scholarship? We were overwhelmed and had to reject more applications because of limited seats however were surely intrigued to know the reasons for such an immediate upsurge. Having conversations with my other students who are already preparing to arrive in India under the Edoofa Scholarship shared some mind-boggling Screenshots from the Fee Prospectus of the Universities in Zimbabwe.

30/1/24, 12:25 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: I am shocked to compile these data for the Fee Structures of some famous Public Universities in Zimbabwe.

*Bindura University of Science Education (BUSE)* -https://www.buse.ac.zw/fees-structure/ - *($680 per term)*

*Chinhoyi University of Technology (CUT)* https://www.cut.ac.zw/welcome/assets/files/fees-structure/School%20of%20Engineering%20Science.pdf - *($535 per term)*

*University of Zimbabwe (UZ)* -https://www.uz.ac.zw/index.php/faculties/160-fac-of-medicine/med-deparrtments/305-med-dpt-of-comm *($523 per term)*

NUST -*($870 per term)*

*I am sure you and your family must have also discussed this,*. So what have you decided for your child's future ahead?
30/1/24, 12:28 PM - +263 77 854 2238: We were basically hoping to deal with you.
30/1/24, 12:29 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: This is well noted and I appreciate your willingness!
30/1/24, 12:30 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
30/1/24, 12:38 PM - +263 77 854 2238: Ok that's fine.
30/1/24, 12:55 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Being a career counsellor, my aspirations for young learners like your child is similar. I firmly believe higher education should combine the following for a learner to achieve their goals:-

Quality Education
Conducive Environment
Critical Thinking and Practical learning skills
Technological Literacy and Attachments
Cultural Awareness and Global Perspective
Career guidance, Mentorships, etc.

*However, not everyone achieves success. Do you know why*?
30/1/24, 1:35 PM - +263 77 854 2238: Thank you
30/1/24, 1:41 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
30/1/24, 1:41 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Therefore, It is important to know the facts of Edoofa's guidance and uniqueness compared to the normal University approach.

1) *Personalized mentorship and guidance throughout your course:-* As your Career Counsellor, I have known you since the beginning of the process, understanding your interests, aspirations, family background and plans for your career, unlike a University officer who may come across your application for the first time and treats with the same importance like others. I personally understand where you come from and what is required for you to be successful.
30/1/24, 1:41 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
30/1/24, 1:41 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: 3) *Financial Support and Planning:-* With a flexible payment plan for registration fees spreading across 45 days, the remaining cost of education can be paid in two installments. Students are ensured to open Indian bank accounts so that parents can even deposit the fees in monthly installments.

30/1/24, 1:41 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: These are aspects that no other organization or University possesses as of now, I hope you are looking forward to such an opportunity for your child's career, aren't you?
