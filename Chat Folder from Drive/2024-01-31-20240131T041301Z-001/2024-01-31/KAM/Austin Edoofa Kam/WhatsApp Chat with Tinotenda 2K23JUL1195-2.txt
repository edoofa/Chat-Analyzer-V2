12/1/24, 6:05 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Tinotenda,

I trust this message finds you in good health. As we step into the second week of January, I wanted to reach out and share an exciting milestone that India as a country achieved within the first week of 2024 - the successful India's Chandrayaan-3 Engine Test.
12/1/24, 6:05 PM - Kirti Edoofa: This accomplishment is responsible for the third lunar mission, aiming to land a rover on the Moon's south polar region and conduct scientific studies that could check Moon's viability to sustain life. It signifies a significant scientific advancement, laying the groundwork for future progress.
12/1/24, 6:05 PM - Kirti Edoofa: This achievement has not only pushed boundaries but also inspired young minds all over the world to pursue their dreams. On the same note, I wanted to extend my heartiest wishes for the New Year to you and your family and check in to see how you and your family started your year?
13/1/24, 3:28 AM - +263 77 582 5214: Despite the loss of our family Aunt that transpired on December 12, we managed to start the year on a fair note. We hope it is going to be a very good year for us as a family for it's the same year we are expecting our dear Son, Tinotenda his journey to study abroad which we expect to be a game changing experience. We would want to extend our gratitude to you and the organization for also remembering us during this season. Thank you very much. Stay blessed now and forever.
13/1/24, 11:18 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Tinotenda.

I hope you are doing well. Thank you for sharing your thoughts and experiences with me. I'm deeply sorry to hear about the loss of your Aunt on December 12. The passing of a loved one is always a challenging time, and I hope you find comfort and strength in each other as a family during this period of mourning.
13/1/24, 11:20 AM - Kirti Edoofa: It's heartening to hear that despite this loss, you've started the new year with a sense of hope and positivity. The anticipation of Tinotenda's journey to study abroad is indeed an exciting prospect and a significant milestone for your family. I have no doubt that this will be a transformative experience for him, opening doors to new opportunities and learnings that will enrich not only his life but also bring pride and joy to your family.
13/1/24, 11:20 AM - Kirti Edoofa: I am truly grateful for your kind words of appreciation towards our organization and myself. It's an honor to be a part of your journey and to have the opportunity to support you during both the highs and lows.
13/1/24, 1:15 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I was hoping to get a response from you, however, you did not respond, since it's been a long day for me, along with the conclusion of our working hours, let's plan to reconnect on Monday to continue our discussion. I'm optimistic that you'll be able to connect then. Have a great night, and looking forward to our conversation Monday.
22/1/24, 11:32 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Greetings dear parents and Tinotenda
*I am Mr Austin, Senior Career Counsellor at Edoofa*
I hope you all are doing well

If you recall, I hosted your counselling and evaluation sessions, and you made me proud by qualifying for our prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program. I received results from all my students, happy and exhilarating with joy. Recalling our interaction together after a frantic search for your name I ended up messaging you today. I understand your calibre and had a discussion with the Admissions Head and have decided to *personally look after your admission process so that we can proceed with your application on priority through the best possible opportunities and exposures.*

Hence, I request you to come online at *2:00 pm CAT tomorrow* and notify on this platform so that I can guide you ahead.

We were overwhelmed and had to reject more applications because of limited seats however were surely intrigued to know the reasons for such an immediate upsurge. Having conversations with my other students who are already preparing to arrive in India under the Edoofa Scholarship shared some mind-boggling Screenshots from the Fee Prospectus of the Universities in Zimbabwe.
