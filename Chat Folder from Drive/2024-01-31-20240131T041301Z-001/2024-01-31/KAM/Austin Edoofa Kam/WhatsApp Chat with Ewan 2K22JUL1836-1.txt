4/1/24, 9:00 PM - +263 71 470 8325: OK about my concerns and what I was hoping for as a student who want to study engineering was to find a scholarship and to get admission in Indian Institute of Technology universities. I have done a thorough research on them and I see myself securing a good future by getting admission in one of those schools. Please if you can assist me in getting into one of these schools I would gladly appreciate it and would be indebted to you as Edoofa and would do by all power to support your organization in any way I can.

Thank you
16/1/24, 10:55 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Ewan,

I trust this message finds you well, and I hope you are in high spirits. In recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their A-Level results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey.
16/1/24, 10:55 AM - Kirti Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?
16/1/24, 11:28 AM - +263 71 470 8325: OK ok

*I am Mr Austin, Senior Career Counsellor at Edoofa*
I hope you all are doing well

If you recall, I hosted your counselling and evaluation sessions, and you made me proud by qualifying for our prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program. I received results from all my students, happy and exhilarating with joy. Recalling our interaction together after a frantic search for your name I ended up messaging you today. I understand your calibre and had a discussion with the Admissions Head and have decided to *personally look after your admission process so that we can proceed with your application on priority through the best possible opportunities and exposures.*

Hence I request you to come online at the earliest and notify me so that I can guide you ahead.

May I know, what exactly happened due to which you weren't able to proceed and what are your plans as of now?
22/1/24, 1:00 PM - +263 71 470 8325: Well I didn't really like Galgotias university

22/1/24, 1:08 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: This is well noted!

We were overwhelmed and had to reject more applications because of limited seats however were surely intrigued to know the reasons for such an immediate upsurge.

Career guidance, Mentorships, etc.

*However, not everyone achieves success. Do you know why*?

22/1/24, 4:48 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
22/1/24, 4:48 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: 3) *Financial Support and Planning:-* With a flexible payment plan for registration fees spreading across 45 days, the remaining cost of education can be paid in two installments.

29/1/24, 9:38 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: I am glad that you you have researched on the University and let us discuss the same now
29/1/24, 9:39 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion -

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?

4. What’s the Registration fee?
29/1/24, 9:40 AM - +263 71 470 8325: I want to inquire on the tuition fee per semester
29/1/24, 9:41 AM - +263 71 470 8325: Isn't it too much
29/1/24, 9:41 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: I will be guiding you through the details one by one Ewan, you can refer to your letter and answer these questions
29/1/24, 9:45 AM - +263 71 470 8325: Ok

2. 4 years
3. $200
4. $700
29/1/24, 10:06 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: *Yes, that is correct. As you can see in your offer letter, your course is a 4-year-long course, and each year is divided into 2 semesters, this means that you will have 8 semesters in your degree.*

After the scholarship, your per semester tuition fee is $1225 making your per annum tuition fee ($1225*2) = $2450.
29/1/24, 10:07 AM - +263 77 979 7389: Morning.
29/1/24, 10:07 AM - +263 77 979 7389: I'm following.
29/1/24, 10:19 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Now, Let me also brief you on the two categories of accommodation that are available at LPU -

*1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels inside LPU have different categories. Standard Room with Air Cooler and Standard Room with Air Conditioner with a different number of seaters, the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want.

The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a standard four-seater air cooler room is $1125 and the per annum standard mess/food service fee is $550 and this increases with the type of room/meal plan you choose.

*2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

We also have many students in India who have opted for accommodation outside the LPU campus considering it is more affordable, the cost will be around $1000 per annum and that includes Rent, Food, Wifi Service, and other basic amenities such as water and electricity bills.

The outside accommodations are safe. Students have an option to cook for themselves, along with that they find a community of Edoofians from Africa who are already studying at the same university as them.
29/1/24, 10:20 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: If you decide to stay on campus, the university officials will help you settle and will be taking responsibility for your well-being, our per annum accommodation cost will be $1675.

However, if a student doesn’t wish to stay on campus and is looking for more affordable accommodation options, in that case, they can go with the off-campus accommodation where their per annum cost would be around $1000 including the food cost and they can also cook food for themselves.
29/1/24, 10:20 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: For the off-campus accommodation, you can connect with any of the Edoofians staying off-campus, and he/she would help you look for the off-campus accommodation options. If you are not connected with any students, we will help you connect with them near your time of arrival so that they can help you with the off-campus accommodation options.

LPU never forces anyone to choose the Hostel, they ask them to visit the campus, check for themselves, and then decide whether he/she wants to stay inside or outside the campus. Are you clear on this?
29/1/24, 10:25 AM - +263 77 979 7389: I'm lost here
29/1/24, 10:31 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: May I know, which part is unclear to you?
29/1/24, 10:38 AM - +263 77 979 7389: Meaning it will be 2450 plus $1675 per annum
29/1/24, 10:47 AM - +263 77 979 7389: Are there payment plans
29/1/24, 10:48 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: That is correct in the case of on-campus Accommodation. As you can see it is expensive to stay in the campus which is the reason, Edoofians prefer to stay outside which is walking distance from the campus which is less expensive and offers more freedom in terms of Accommodation and Food.

-Moreover, students can cook for themselves if required. 
-They will be surrounded by Edoofians from Zimbabwe and can adapt well with the environment with their help
-Our Department of Student Welfare(DSW) will be assisting Edoofians to find Accommodation off campus
-Our DSW will be available for any further assistance for Edoofians throughout the course(applicable for on campus as well) <This message was edited>
29/1/24, 10:49 AM - +263 77 979 7389: Ok ok I understand
29/1/24, 10:50 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Yes please, 
In the case of off campus, you can pay the cost of living on a monthly basis thereby reducing the pressure.

The cost of education can be paid in two equal installments. Each installment before a semester.There are two semesters in a year <This message was edited>
29/1/24, 10:51 AM - +263 77 979 7389: What about off campus
29/1/24, 10:52 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Moreover, our DSW will guide Edoofians to open an Indian Bank Account after arrival which means you can also deposit the tuition fees to Ewan's account on monthly installments and Ewan can be the amount in total before the semester taking away the pressure of raising the fees in two parts
29/1/24, 10:52 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Please note that the mentioned is for outside campus itself,
Off campus-Monthly installments
On Campus-Semester wise(2 installments)
29/1/24, 10:53 AM - +263 77 979 7389: Ok ok
29/1/24, 10:54 AM - +263 77 979 7389: Ok let's discuss more on off campus living
29/1/24, 10:54 AM - +263 77 979 7389: How much are the installments
29/1/24, 10:57 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Sure, living outside the campus will cost the learner around $1000 per annum inclusive of  Rent, Food, Wifi Service, and other basic amenities such as water and electricity bills, which means the expense per month would be around $80-$85 for all the above mentioned.
29/1/24, 11:05 AM - +263 71 470 8325: OK ok that is good
29/1/24, 11:06 AM - +263 71 470 8325: Do I need to make a once of payment for the $1000 or...
29/1/24, 11:06 AM - +263 71 470 8325: Greetings Mr Austin, pardon my manners
29/1/24, 11:07 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Indeed!
29/1/24, 11:09 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: I believe you are referring to the Off Campus living. No please, you do not have to make a once of payment for the $1000. You can pay in monthly installments
29/1/24, 11:11 AM - +263 71 470 8325: OK ok that is affordable
29/1/24, 11:12 AM - +263 71 470 8325: What about on tuition
29/1/24, 11:18 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: The tuition fee is supposed to be paid in two equal installments, each installment before a semester
29/1/24, 11:25 AM - +263 71 470 8325: As in one installment before semester and the other during the semester
29/1/24, 11:26 AM - +263 71 470 8325: Does the EWYL program cover some of the tuition
29/1/24, 11:28 AM - +263 77 979 7389: Can some of the tuition be covered by the EWYL program
29/1/24, 11:30 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: The first Semester fee after your arrival in India in August this year and second semester fee in December this year
29/1/24, 11:31 AM - +263 71 470 8325: I am not following
29/1/24, 11:32 AM - +263 77 979 7389: Meaning from August to December its Semester
29/1/24, 11:32 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Absolutely, once Ewan is here in India, our EWYL mentors will be discussing projects through which he can earn scholarship credits, gain experience and reduce the cost of education. At the same, our EWYL team will pave regular visits to campuses to discuss and motivate Edoofians along with guiding them through the projects
29/1/24, 11:33 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: That is correct
August-December is the first semester
January to May is the second semester
June-July -Summer Vacation
29/1/24, 11:40 AM - +263 71 470 8325: Is the $700 part of the $1225 tuition
29/1/24, 11:47 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: That is correct Ewan
29/1/24, 11:48 AM - +263 71 470 8325: So it will be subtracted meaning that we will be paying $525 in August
29/1/24, 11:49 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: That is correct, Ewan
29/1/24, 11:51 AM - +263 71 470 8325: So when should we pay the $700
29/1/24, 11:55 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: You have two options
-Either you can pay $700 this month or you can pay $350 this month and $350 before 28th Februrary
29/1/24, 11:58 AM - +263 71 470 8325: Can we make the first payment in the first week of February because January has already ended
29/1/24, 12:02 PM - +263 71 470 8325: Can you bear with me on this one
29/1/24, 12:05 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Well Ewan, Since we are experiencing a huge rush of qualifiers as the A level results are out in Zambia, Zimbabwe and South Africa, it is important to reserve the seat at the earliest. Therefore, it is encouraged to pay a part of the registration fee within this month itself and the remaining can be paid as per the timeframe.

But I do understand the challenge you shared. So may I ask, how much towards the registration fee would you be able to pay within this month?
29/1/24, 12:17 PM - +263 77 979 7389: I'll get back to you on that
29/1/24, 12:19 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Sure, by when can I expect your feedback please?
29/1/24, 12:27 PM - +263 77 979 7389: Before 2pm
29/1/24, 12:27 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Sure, that would be fine!
29/1/24, 12:31 PM - +263 71 470 8325: Thank you
29/1/24, 2:03 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: LPU is one of the best universities in India and it has been ranked in the top 80 universities worldwide, because of its international tie-ups, the exposure a student gets at the university is indomitable. 

It has a campus of 800 acres, with over 100,000 students studying from all over the world. Students from LPU are placed at Microsoft, Google, IMF, Work Bank, and many more. It has spent a lot of money building the infrastructure so that a quality service can be given to the students.
