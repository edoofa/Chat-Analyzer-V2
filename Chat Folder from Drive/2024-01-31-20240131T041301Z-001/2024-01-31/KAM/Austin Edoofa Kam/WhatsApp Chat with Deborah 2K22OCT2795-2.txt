18/12/23, 2:40 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon dear parents and Deborah. I hope this message finds you well and blessed. 

Thank you for being patient with us. How are you doing today?
18/12/23, 2:44 PM - +263 71 372 2404: am good and how are you
18/12/23, 2:47 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am great, thank you for asking. May I know if you are ready to proceed with the session of the offer letter discussion?
18/12/23, 3:02 PM - +263 71 372 2404: yess l am
18/12/23, 3:29 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let me also brief you on the accommodation as well:  The on-campus accommodations at the Quest campus have different categories and the pricing for every room is different as mentioned in your offer letter.
18/12/23, 3:29 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: However, all the international students prefer to stay off-campus as it is a lot cheaper and they get more freedom. We would advise the same for you. The university officials will help you find off-campus accommodations and help you settle in after you report to the campus.
18/12/23, 3:29 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: If you opt for accommodation outside the Campus, it would be comparatively cheaper, the cost will be around $500 per annum and that would include your food cost as well which means you would have to pay only $30 to $40 per month towards your living expenses making your per annum educational cost $1100  + $500 = $1600. I hope you are clear about this?
18/12/23, 4:04 PM - +263 71 372 2404: thats reasonable
18/12/23, 4:04 PM - +263 71 372 2404: yes l understand
18/12/23, 5:12 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now that you know your per annum educational expenses for your education abroad, let me also help you understand how you can make your education more affordable. 

Ideally, the complete per annum fee is to be paid by the student, however, for students under the Edoofa Program, they have an additional opportunity of the EWYL Program. Because of that, you as a student can earn $800 to $1200 worth of scholarship credits in a year and use them to pay a part of your fee.
18/12/23, 5:12 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I would also like to inform you that the above range shared does not mean that a student can earn credits only up to $1200. There is no upper limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits. 

In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his or her higher education, he/she can earn accordingly. Are you clear on this?
18/12/23, 5:13 PM - +263 71 372 2404: l am
18/12/23, 5:21 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: This message was deleted
18/12/23, 5:22 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, to understand how the EWYL Program helps you - Let us assume you earn scholarship credits worth $1000 in a year with the help of the EWYL Program.

Now with this, you can use the earned $1000 to pay a part of your per annum fee of $1600 (with the off-campus accommodation) and so the balance fee becomes $1600 - $1000 = $600 which will have to be paid by your parents/guardians at a stretch of one year.

With this, I believe you are able to see how you can make your education more affordable and reduce your family's financial pressure?
18/12/23, 5:26 PM - +263 71 372 2404: yes its very beneficial
18/12/23, 5:43 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Moving ahead, as informed, the registration fee of $500 mentioned in your offer letter will be adjusted against your first year's tuition fee, therefore the amount of tuition fee that you will be required to pay after you come to India will be $1100 - $500 = $600. 

I hope you are clear about this as well?
18/12/23, 5:43 PM - +263 71 372 2404: l understand
18/12/23, 5:44 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
18/12/23, 5:56 PM - +263 71 372 2404: yes please
18/12/23, 6:25 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $350 of the registration fee. This $350 can be conveniently paid in two instalments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$175 before the first deadline date of December 29th, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$175 before the second deadline date of January 29th, 2024* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
18/12/23, 9:12 PM - +263 71 372 2404: thats reasonable
19/12/23, 7:14 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening!

I hope you are doing well and blessed today. Please excuse me for the late reply. I was occupied with a university official today. May I know if you are available to proceed with our session?
19/12/23, 7:26 PM - +263 71 372 2404: l am available
19/12/23, 7:41 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $350 within 15 working days, before December 29th, 2023. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
19/12/23, 7:47 PM - +263 71 372 2404: yes the option is clear
19/12/23, 7:58 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
19/12/23, 7:59 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
19/12/23, 8:16 PM - +263 71 372 2404: no in Hwange
19/12/23, 8:32 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
19/12/23, 8:32 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
19/12/23, 8:32 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
19/12/23, 9:18 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I was expecting to hear back from you, but as there hasn't been a response and given that it's been a long day for me, along with the conclusion of our working hours, let's plan to reconnect tomorrow to continue our discussion. I'm optimistic that you'll be able to connect then. Have a great night, and looking forward to our conversation tomorrow.
19/12/23, 11:38 PM - +263 71 372 2404: Thank you Good night
20/12/23, 2:08 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon dear parents and Deborah. I hope this message finds you well and blessed. 

May I know if you are ready to proceed with the session?
20/12/23, 2:25 PM - +263 71 372 2404: yes we may proceed
20/12/23, 2:46 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. nce you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
20/12/23, 2:46 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Charles FBC Bank for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
20/12/23, 2:47 PM - +263 71 372 2404: noted  .we will work witg Mr Rajan only
20/12/23, 2:48 PM - +263 71 372 2404: yes please
20/12/23, 3:04 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly, if due to an unfortunate event. If making the payment through Mr. Charles is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -
20/12/23, 3:05 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Bank Name: FBC
Account Holder - Charles Jerera
Account Number - 5333 0380 1404 8828
Bank Name - FBC Bank Limited 
Branch - Masvingo
20/12/23, 5:41 PM - +263 71 372 2404: thank you
20/12/23, 5:42 PM - +263 71 372 2404: we will choose a method convenient for us
20/12/23, 6:19 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly, that works. Now, do you have any queries that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
20/12/23, 6:20 PM - +263 71 372 2404: no l hve no questions towards payment methods u may proceed
20/12/23, 7:26 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. In that case, let me also tell you a bit about the Quest Group of institutions. It is the most ideal destination for international students interested in studying in India. They have more than 200 International students from more than 15 different countries in Africa and Southeast Asia.
						
It has a Unique Mentorship program to encourage students to do well according to their abilities and strengths and has been awarded Outstanding Technical Institution of North India during the World Education Summit and Awards.

20/12/23, 8:50 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: This is undoubtedly an exciting moment for you and your family, as you have received a scholarship offer from an Indian university, bringing you one step closer to realizing your dream of pursuing education abroad.

28/12/23, 2:21 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: It's wonderful to hear that you've had a family discussion about the offer letter, and I am confident that you must all be delighted to witness the positive strides being made toward realizing your higher education goals in India.

As you move forward, I am curious to know how your family conversation went. What are your thoughts and feelings regarding the discussion?
28/12/23, 2:49 PM - +263 71 372 2404: Will there be other university offers or this is the only one
28/12/23, 3:09 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Your university scholarship application is based on merit systems. As of now, your application has been accepted by the Quest Group of Institutions and since we have shared his application with multiple universities, we are also hoping to receive updates from others. 

Once we get the same update, we will surely inform you, but each university takes its own time to consider the application. So, you have to be patient while the universities are evaluating the application.
28/12/23, 3:10 PM - +263 71 372 2404: ohhh okay
28/12/23, 4:08 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: May I know if you are clear as of now?

Moving forward, may I inquire if you had the opportunity to conduct further research about the university and learn more about it?
28/12/23, 6:05 PM - +263 71 372 2404: am still on that process
28/12/23, 7:29 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: As you explore this opportunity further, I am sure that you are committed to completing the registration process and securing the scholarship seat. To help you get insights into how your life will be in India and the opportunities that you will have through Edoofa here, let me help you connect with one of our students - Valerie Rukobo.
28/12/23, 7:29 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Valerie.vcf (file attached)
28/12/23, 7:30 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: She is a Zimbabwean Alumni who was among the first batch of Edoofians in 2017 who commenced their educational journey in India. She successfully completed her bachelor's in Computer Application, through the Edoofa program. 

Following her undergraduate studies, Valerie gained valuable work experience in India for a year before deciding to pursue her master's degree, also through the Edoofa Program. Her journey and experiences are a testament to the opportunities and support that the Edoofa Program offers.
28/12/23, 7:30 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: If you wish, you can contact Valerie to learn more about her experiences and insights regarding the program. Additionally, you could request her to share her Offer Letter, showcasing the professional opportunities she secured through Edoofa.

Valerie's father, a retired Police Officer in Zimbabwe, can also provide valuable insights into his daughter's experiences and the impact of the Edoofa Program on her education and career development in India. Feel free to reach out to them for a more comprehensive understanding of the program's benefits and outcomes.
28/12/23, 7:31 PM - +263 71 372 2404: thank you for the contact
28/12/23, 7:31 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: You are most welcome. Moving forward, I would like to discuss your plans for securing your scholarship seat so that we can communicate them with the university. 

As the university has set a deadline of December 29, 2023, for completing the registration process, you have two options to choose from. You can either make an initial payment of $175, or you can opt to pay the full $350 in one installment to expedite your admission process. Have you had an opportunity to consider which payment plan would be most suitable for you? <This message was edited>

I trust this message finds you well, and I hope you are in high spirits. In recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their A-Level results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey.
16/1/24, 11:13 AM - Ashi Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?
16/1/24, 11:52 AM - +27 76 301 7612: <Media omitted>

If you recall, I hosted your counselling and evaluation sessions, and you made me proud by qualifying for our prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program. I received results from all my students, happy and exhilarating with joy. Recalling our interaction together after a frantic search for your name I ended up messaging you today. I understand your calibre and had a discussion with the Admissions Head and have decided to *personally look after your admission process so that we can proceed with your application on priority through the best possible opportunities and exposures.*

Hence I request you to come online at the earliest and notify me so that I can guide you ahead.

May I know, what exactly happened due to which you weren't able to proceed and what are your plans for your child as of now?

We were overwhelmed and had to reject more applications because of limited seats however were surely intrigued to know the reasons for such an immediate upsurge. Having conversations with my other students who are already preparing to arrive in India under the Edoofa Scholarship shared some mind-boggling Screenshots from the Fee Prospectus of the Universities in Zimbabwe.

*Sithole Rutendo E*
*Miriam Mufaro Mavura*
*Dezyline Z Marara*

*Let me share all families of students who are in India have gone through what you might be experiencing now. There was a stage of uncertainty and confusion where we guided them as Career Counsellors to ensure our learners fulfill their aspirations!*
22/1/24, 3:28 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: @263773136077, Do you know, any of these students as the seniors of Deborah?
22/1/24, 3:29 PM - +263 77 313 6077: ummm I don't know them

22/1/24, 3:47 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: 1) *Personalized mentorship and guidance throughout your course:-* As your Career Counsellor, I have known you since the beginning of the process, understanding your interests, aspirations, family background and plans for your career, unlike a University officer who may come across your application for the first time and treats with the same importance like others. I personally understand where you come from and what is required for you to be successful.

22/1/24, 3:48 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: 3) *Financial Support and Planning:-* With a flexible payment plan for registration fees spreading across 45 days, the remaining cost of education can be paid in two installments. Students are ensured to open Indian bank accounts so that parents can even deposit the fees in monthly installments.

22/1/24, 5:21 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Perfect, I believe you recall the discussions regarding the University registration fee. It is really crucial to reserve Deborah University seat with the completion of the registration fees which you have missed once due to genuine reasons. So I have made a special request to our Academic Board and a recommendation for Deborah to be reconsidered this time. May I know, how far are prepared towards the University registration fee as of now?

How are you doing?

I have received positive feedback from our Program Director after your interactions. He is impressed with the profile of Deborah and appreciated the A level results after whhich has made a special request to proceed at the earliest with the University offers. At the same time, Mr Gupta walked an extra mile to make with a special recommendation for a higher quantum of scholarship(Upto 100% on tuition fees). This is an exceptional opportunity provided for Deborah despite the huge rush of applicants. You can expect the Offer Letter in the coming days. In case you have any questions, do feel free to reach out to me
30/1/24, 12:26 PM - +263 77 313 6077: thank you.noted.
30/1/24, 12:28 PM - +263 77 313 6077: how much is the tuition fee

30/1/24, 12:29 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: The exact quantum of scholarship and tuition fee will be mentioned on the Offer Letter itself
30/1/24, 1:24 PM - +27 76 301 7612: ohh okay
