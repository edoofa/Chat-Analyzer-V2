*I am Mr Austin, Senior Career Counsellor at Edoofa*
I hope you all are doing well

I received results from all my students, happy and exhilarating with joy. Recalling our interaction together after a frantic search for your name I ended up messaging you today. I understand your calibre and had a discussion with the Admissions Head and have decided to *personally look after your admission process so that we can proceed with your application on priority through the best possible opportunities and exposures.*

Hence, I request you to come online and notify on this platform so that I can guide you ahead.
29/1/24, 2:43 PM - +263 78 206 9497: Afternoon sir
29/1/24, 2:53 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Good to hear from you, Shamiso!

29/1/24, 3:00 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: At the same time, I was going through your Admissions Group and saw that you are yet to complete the University registration process being a bright student. I personally had a discussion with the Admissions Head and have decided to help you in the best possible way as I understand your calibre.  So,are we good to begin?
29/1/24, 3:00 PM - +263 78 206 9497: Yes
29/1/24, 3:08 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Do you know we at EDOOFA received 2000 Applications in a Single Day just a week before and each day since then we are receiving not less than 1000 Applications each day from students seeking Scholarship? We were overwhelmed and had to reject more applications because of limited seats however were surely intrigued to know the reasons for such an immediate upsurge. Having conversations with my other students who are already preparing to arrive in India under the Edoofa Scholarship shared some mind-boggling Screenshots from the Fee Prospectus of the Universities in Zimbabwe.

*I am sure you and your family must have also discussed this,*. So what have you decided for your future ahead?
29/1/24, 3:13 PM - +263 78 206 9497: For me to study abroad
29/1/24, 3:26 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: This is well noted, Shamiso!

29/1/24, 3:51 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: That is alright and I will help you connect back to them
29/1/24, 3:52 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Being a career counsellor, my aspirations for young learners like you are similar. I firmly believe higher education should combine the following for a learner to achieve their goals:-

Quality Education
Conducive Environment
Critical Thinking and Practical learning skills
Technological Literacy and Attachments
Cultural Awareness and Global Perspective
Career guidance, Mentorships, etc.

*However, not everyone achieves success. Do you know why*?
29/1/24, 3:52 PM - +263 78 206 9497: Okay
29/1/24, 4:05 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
29/1/24, 4:05 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Therefore, It is important to know the facts of Edoofa's guidance and uniqueness compared to the normal University approach.

1) *Personalized mentorship and guidance throughout your course:-* As your Career Counsellor, I have known you since the beginning of the process, understanding your interests, aspirations, family background and plans for your career, unlike a University officer who may come across your application for the first time and treats with the same importance like others. I personally understand where you come from and what is required for you to be successful.
29/1/24, 4:06 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
29/1/24, 4:06 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: 3) *Financial Support and Planning:-* With a flexible payment plan for registration fees spreading across 45 days, the remaining cost of education can be paid in two installments. Students are ensured to open Indian bank accounts so that parents can even deposit the fees in monthly installments.

30/1/24, 4:04 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
30/1/24, 7:13 AM - +263 78 206 9497: Okay
30/1/24, 10:03 AM - +263 78 206 9497: Good day sir
30/1/24, 10:33 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Good Morning Shamiso!
How are you today?
30/1/24, 10:40 AM - +263 78 206 9497: I am okay and you
30/1/24, 10:40 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Good to know,. I am doing well!
30/1/24, 10:40 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Do you recall our previous discussions?
30/1/24, 10:43 AM - +263 78 206 9497: Yes but not vividly
30/1/24, 10:43 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Noted Shamiso, Let me help you with a better understanding. *Usually, the registration fee is an additional fee apart from the cost of education but Edoofians receive an exclusive benefit where it is a part of the cost of education itself.* Let me give you an example:-
30/1/24, 10:44 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: As we discussed in the counselling session, the cost of education in India ranges from $6000-$8000 per annum which is reduced to $2000-$3000 per annum through the Edoofa Scholarship Program which includes the registration fee, remaining tuition fees, Accommodation, Food, Wifi, Laundry, library fee etc. Now, let us assume,

1. *Tuition Fee*: $1800 per annum
2. *Food and Accommodation Fee*: $1000 per annum 
Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum
3. *Registration Fee to be paid:* $1000
30/1/24, 10:44 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: This means this registration fee that you pay will be subtracted from the cost of education ($2800-$1000= $1800) and the remaining fee of $1800 can be paid in two installments. The first part of $900 within 3 days after your arrival here in India and the remaining $900 will be due in December 2024, or before your second semester begins.
30/1/24, 10:44 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: The registration fee can be paid either in two equal parts(The first half within 15 days and the second half within 30 days) or in one go itself.

Are you clear with the details?
30/1/24, 10:45 AM - +263 78 206 9497: Yes
30/1/24, 11:06 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Do you have any questions regarding the process now?
30/1/24, 11:06 AM - +263 78 206 9497: No
30/1/24, 11:17 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Noted,  It is really crucial to reserve your University seat with the completion of the registration fees. So I have made a special request to our Academic Board and a recommendation for you to be reconsidered at the earliest. May I know, how far is your family prepared towards the University registration fee as of now?
30/1/24, 11:18 AM - +263 78 206 9497: As of now my family is not prepared financially
30/1/24, 11:20 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Noted Shamiso, I understand that you are interested in this golden opportunity to study in India under the given Scholarship. I do realize that your Family Members may have other concerns and this is the reason I have requested our Program Director Mr. Abhinav to spare some time to talk to your Parents about this. Is your parent available to share the schedule?

30/1/24, 11:34 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Noted, in that case, shall I schedule the call at 6:30 PM CAT today?
30/1/24, 11:34 AM - +263 78 206 9497: Yes
30/1/24, 11:35 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Please ask your mother to greet Mr Abhinav Gupta, Program Director at Edoofa at 6:25 pm CAT today in his inbox to begin the call. Ensure to maintain a stable network for a video call and I wish them a fruitful discussion.
