24/01/24, 12:04 pm - Arshita: Let me brief you that, I want to brief you that the criteria before the pandemic was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is *a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about her achieving it.
24/01/24, 12:05 pm - +263 77 313 2450: Well noted. I am confident and will support her to achieve maximum points
24/01/24, 12:05 pm - Arshita: Noted
24/01/24, 12:06 pm - Arshita: Can you please share the results in a text format please?
24/01/24, 12:06 pm - +263 77 313 2450: Will do so
24/01/24, 12:48 pm - Arshita: Based on my evaluations, considering your subjects, interests and passion towards law you are eligible to pursue

Do you want me to explain the course in depth?
24/01/24, 12:53 pm - +263 77 313 2450: Please explain

A course in BA LLB is an exciting one that offers multiple career opportunities. The 5 key positions associated with this course are:

*1) Legal Advisor*
The main role of a legal advisor or legal counsellor is to offer legal advice and work, for organizations and the employees of the organization. Their services can be utilized by the Government, NGOs, other associations or large organizations.  The legal advisors are in-house experts, in contrast to attorneys and supporters who offer their services to society in general. It is often seen that legal advisors were former advocates and therefore their skills and training have to be in accordance with those that are needed for attorneys and advocates.

*2) Lawyer*
As is evident by the title, is a person whose profession is law. There are different specializations for law including Cyber law, Environmental law, Company law, Criminal law and Family Law. Their main job role is to represent their clients in jurisdiction matters. Their work involves a lot of research, including that on the subject and their client’s perspective. They then go on to represent and defend their clients in the court.

*3) Public Prosecutor*

The criminal procedure code of 1973 under section 24, outlines the arrangements concerning the Public Prosecutor.

*4) Judge*

A lot of dedication and hard work is required to complete this course with your law degree, but on successful completion, this career can be extremely rewarding.

A career in law is considered to be much sought after, satisfying and lucrative.

*Required Skill-Set for BA LLB*
It is rightly said that learning is an on – going process and this holds true especially in the aspect of personal and professional development. Although an individual may possess certain skills they need to be improved and developed constantly. A few key skills that are of paramount importance in the field of law are:

*Good Written Communication*– Writing forms a major part of the work in in the legal profession. The written communication involves letters, documents, notices, and so on. The documents must be grammatically correct and error free. This requires a good level of English proficiency.

*Good Verbal Communication*– A lot depends on how well the legal professional can express his or her case, arguments and generally converse with clients and authorities. Good verbal communication ensures good expression and understanding which are crucial for a successful career in law.

*Good Time Management*– In the legal profession, time management is very crucial. The art of delegating tasks, working within deadlines, and prioritizing tasks to achieve success is very essential.

*A great degree of self-confidence*– This profession needs a high degree of self-confidence to win the clients’ trust. A strong belief in yourself will go a long way in winning arguments and cases.

*A high degree of patience*– This is a much needed skill, since you deal with different types of people and some cases and procedures stretch over a period of time which need a lot of patience and careful handling.

*Team player skills*– Since a legal professional will deal with a lot of people therefore to be effective they need to bond with people. The art of getting work done and obtaining information though networking and working with people helps in attaining the objectives.

25/01/24, 9:39 am - Arshita: <Media omitted>
25/01/24, 9:39 am - Arshita: <Media omitted>
25/01/24, 9:54 am - +263 77 313 2450: Thank you for the information
25/01/24, 9:55 am - Arshita: *By any chance are you familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship?*
25/01/24, 10:02 am - +263 77 313 2450: No
25/01/24, 10:08 am - Arshita: Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India compared to other global hubs.

In India, international students face an average expense of *$6000-$8000 annually.* While this is very low as compared to the Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc where the cost of education ranges from $15000-$35000 annually, it is still beyond the reach of many.

With the Edoofa Scholarship Program, the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000 per annum* for the students who are found eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility Check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Laundry, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
25/01/24, 10:08 am - Arshita: <Media omitted>
25/01/24, 10:08 am - Arshita: In simple words what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost $3000 or less a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well. 

However, as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even after this we allow the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.

*So do you feel the reduced cost of education is affordable to your family?*
25/01/24, 10:12 am - +263 77 313 2450: It is affordable especially with the Earn as you Learn program.
25/01/24, 10:12 am - Arshita: Noted, 
So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians. Looking at this cost of education as well, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits which can help in reducing their fees further.

Do you know how that is done?
25/01/24, 10:13 am - +263 77 313 2450: No. Please share
25/01/24, 10:13 am - Arshita: Let me tell you how Edoofa helps Edoofians bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the *Earn While You Learn Program*

The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that are equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable. The Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies and needs, converting an Individual into a market-ready professional. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
25/01/24, 10:14 am - Arshita: *Projects with Brands and Companies: -*
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, such as:
*Africa Global Radio-* The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project and hear from the CEO about the exposures of the Edoofa program.

*Skooqs-* This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

*Recruitment Partners:-*
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs

25/01/24, 10:21 am - Arshita: Great, Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, a few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :

*1. Expert Career Counselling:* We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counsellors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.

*2. Affordability through guaranteed scholarships:* Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off.

*3. Earn While You Learn:* The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing our students for the real world. 

*4.Higher Education Concierge:* A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.*

After going through these facts that make Edoofa different, which one out of the 4 did you feel is the most significant?
25/01/24, 10:24 am - +263 77 313 2450: All of them

25/01/24, 10:28 am - +263 77 313 2450: Noted
25/01/24, 10:28 am - Arshita: As you see, there is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it depends upon his/her hard work.
25/01/24, 10:28 am - Arshita: *As we move to the last part of the session, let me highlight a few requirements while a student applies alone* 

*1) Application Form* -An online or offline form that asks for your personal details and academic background.

*2) Statement of Purpose-* An essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and your aspirations for your career.

*3) Letter of Recommendation-* from Senior authorities, School Heads or others on why they recommend you to be a right fit for an international university.
Do you know about other requirements?
25/01/24, 10:29 am - +263 77 313 2450: Ok
25/01/24, 10:30 am - Arshita: Absolutely, When a student applies alone for an international University, on average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose costs between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally and act as a major parameter to decide the child’s eligibility. If you apply to 5 Universities, the average costs for the mentioned would be $1350-$1750, *without even receiving a guarantee to be selected*

*Edoofa has identified a solution for this uncertainty and unaffordability.* If a student qualifies after the eligibility check, not only does Edoofa help them draft their statement of purpose but also helps in terms of Visa Documentation Assistance, University Session and selection, Individual mentorship, etc, reducing the costs significantly to $750 which is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
25/01/24, 10:30 am - Arshita: <Media omitted>
25/01/24, 10:31 am - +263 77 313 2450: Please do
25/01/24, 10:31 am - Arshita: The enrollment fee is to be paid only if a child is found eligible for the Edoofa Scholarship Program after passing the eligibility check stage, it includes, 

*Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
*Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
*Earn While You Learn Program and training*
*University sessions and selection*
*A guaranteed scholarship seat*
*Visa Documentation Assistance*
*The Foster and Care throughout the course of an Edoofian*
25/01/24, 10:31 am - Arshita: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge due to which parents might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short period of 7 days and for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option wherein if the student is found eligible, instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, *parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days thereby reducing the financial pressure.*
25/01/24, 10:32 am - +263 77 313 2450: Great
25/01/24, 10:33 am - Arshita: There are 3 phases to the enrollment process.
 
*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation
If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Acceptance Letter. You are supposed to pay the enrollment fee of $350 in 7 days for the scholarship seat reservation and to begin the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2*: Once the students complete Phase 1 they will be starting the Earn While You Learn program session(Each student will have an opportunity to earn scholarship credits that can be used to reduce their fee even before their A-Level result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final A-level results are out and the student has passed the requirement as per Edoofa, then their final university evaluation and Admission will continue. However, if the student wouldn’t meet the requirements as per the university and Edoofa, then the $350 will be refunded to the parent.

The amount of credits earned by the student in phase 2 can be used for the first year’s annual fee itself so that parents are relieved from financial stress paving the way for proper financial planning for higher education.
25/01/24, 10:36 am - +263 77 313 2450: I please simplify on phase 2. How does she start EWYL when she is still at school
25/01/24, 10:37 am - Arshita: Do you mean how would Britney continue with her EWYL process while being in school?
25/01/24, 10:37 am - +263 77 313 2450: Yes.
25/01/24, 10:38 am - +263 77 313 2450: Still at school here in Zimbabwe
25/01/24, 10:39 am - Arshita: She will be allotted her EWYL mentors and they will connect with her and guide her. 

A proper schedule considering all the aspects will be made so that her studies are not disturbed
25/01/24, 10:47 am - +263 77 313 2450: Noted.
25/01/24, 10:47 am - Arshita: <Media omitted>
25/01/24, 10:49 am - +263 77 313 2450: I think it's stage 1
25/01/24, 10:50 am - Arshita: Well, 
We also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.

*Step 1:Connect with a counsellor-* As your counsellor, now we are going through the counselling process discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Edoofa Scholarship.                        

*Step 2:Eligibility Check-* The eligibility check includes the interviews with the Academic Board and Scholarship Test.

*Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa-* If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter.

*Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program-* This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.

We are left with steps 5 and 6.
So shall I explain them to you?
25/01/24, 10:52 am - +263 77 313 2450: Yes please
25/01/24, 10:53 am - Arshita: Step 5: After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities. 

*August 2025 intake, applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from the Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.*

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 instalments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.
25/01/24, 10:53 am - Arshita: *Step 6:* Once you are done with the registration fee payment, you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.
25/01/24, 10:53 am - Arshita: I hope you are clear with the process.
25/01/24, 11:01 am - +263 77 313 2450: Understood
25/01/24, 11:52 am - +263 77 313 2450: Thank you so much for giving us an insight on the Edoofa Program.
25/01/24, 7:17 pm - Arshita: We have come to the end of your counselling session. Before I guide you Step 2 of the Eligibility Check, I want you to have a full-fledged discussion of the Edoofa program within your family as higher education is supposed to be a family decision. Ensure to include these aspects during the discussions:-

*About the EDOOFA Program and its vision of making Education Affordable and Edoofians Employment Ready.*
*Value of the career of an Edoofian after pursuing higher education in India.*
*The financial aspects and how Edoofa brings in affordability and self-financing opportunities for students.*
25/01/24, 7:17 pm - Arshita: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences,

*Edoofa’s Website- www.edoofa.com* 
*Pictures (Edoofians from Africa studying in India): https://tinyurl.com/3ke35s35*

*Please ensure to go through the FAQ document before the next stage and refer the same to your family as it has answers to most of the queries.* Furthermore, if you have any other queries I would suggest that you note them down and we will discuss them in the next session.

Let me also share a few pictures of the students who are studying in India through the Edoofa Program so that you can witness the exposures and their experiences.

26/01/24, 10:54 am - Arshita: Good Morning Everyone, Hope you are doing well.

I believe you must have discussed all the above mentioned points with your family?

I am here to address any questions if they have any.

Are we good to proceed with your application now?
26/01/24, 11:22 am - +263 78 075 7439: Good morning how are you?



Yes I’m ready
26/01/24, 11:23 am - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: Good Morning Everyone. 
 
*I am Mr. Piyush, The Head of Counselling at Edoofa.* 

I have been evaluating your responses in the counseling session with your counselor Ms Arshita.

I believe you must have gone through the entire counseling session once again with your family members.

*Are we good to proceed with your eligibility check evaluation now?*
26/01/24, 11:28 am - +263 78 075 7439: Nice to know you Mr.Piyush 


Indeed we went through the entire counseling as a family.

Yes!We are good to proceed
26/01/24, 11:29 am - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: That is great, may I know what all did you happen to discuss with your family please?
26/01/24, 11:37 am - +263 77 313 2450: We agreed that it will be a good move for Britney to enrol with Edoofa though we are not very sure if will be manageable in terms of cost.
26/01/24, 11:37 am - +263 77 313 2450: May I also know the flight charges for planning purposes
26/01/24, 11:43 am - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: @263773132450 can you elaborate as to what all were you able to understand regarding the financial aspect of the Edoofa Program please?
26/01/24, 11:49 am - +263 77 313 2450: I understood about the EWYL and went through the fees structure in comparison to that of other universities. Enrolling in India seems to be cheaper of course.  We are very much interested but our budget will allow us to start committing (financially) end of April 2024.
26/01/24, 11:51 am - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: @263773132450 I surely understand what you are sharing, you see as a parent I am sure you would agree with the fact that in Zimbabwe, every term the school fee is hiked with an enormous amount which puts an undue pressure on the parents, isn't it/
26/01/24, 11:52 am - +263 77 313 2450: Correct
26/01/24, 12:10 pm - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: @263773132450 you see, during my stay in Zimbabwe from March to June 2023, I gained valuable insights. Many Zimbabwean students, including those I interacted with and those who shared their experiences, highlighted the financial challenges of pursuing higher education. Tertiary education expenses in Zimbabwe can amount to approximately $3000-$4000 annually.

While the cost of education remains within the range of $1200-$1500 per year, the cost of living is notably high. Even a basic meal of Sadza and curry can cost a student $1 per serving. This means around $1100 is allocated solely for food, with additional essential costs such as internet, accommodation, and transportation pushing the total to $2000-$2500 per year.

During my visit, I encountered Zimbabwean students who had applied for the Edoofa Program in 2018-2019 but hadn't proceeded due to the lure of quick earnings within the country. However, this year, they shared their hardships, with some holding prestigious degrees from institutions like UZ, MSU, and HIT, now working as petrol attendants or mobile/laptop repair technicians. Others faced even greater challenges, resorting to selling Ecocash, Simcards, or vegetables.

Observing this scenario, it's evident that many of them regret not seizing the opportunity earlier. I understand the harsh realities they face.
26/01/24, 12:10 pm - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: What are your thoughts regarding the same?
26/01/24, 12:13 pm - +263 77 313 2450: You are very correct. I don't have any problem with Edoofa just that it's something we had no plans about presently. As I said that we will be ready by end of April, for any monetary commitments with Edoofa
26/01/24, 12:13 pm - +263 77 313 2450: In February we will be paying ZIMSEC examination fee for Britney.
26/01/24, 12:16 pm - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: I surely understand @263773132450, however may I know which finances are you referring to as of now?
26/01/24, 12:22 pm - +263 77 313 2450: $350 for seat reservation
26/01/24, 12:35 pm - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: Okay apart from that, may I know what else do you feel you might face a challenge with please?
26/01/24, 12:42 pm - +263 77 313 2450: As long as I pay after April I will try. Isnt there are terms?
26/01/24, 12:43 pm - +263 77 313 2450: Or you can highlight on the costs that need to be met this year.
26/01/24, 12:47 pm - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: Let me help you out with that @263773132450
26/01/24, 12:47 pm - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: <Media omitted>
26/01/24, 12:48 pm - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: Referring to this image let me re-explain the financial aspect of the program in 3 parts.

1. The Enrollment fee is $350 which includes application forms, statement of purpose, letter of recommendation, visa assistance, Earn While You Learn Program's training etc.

2. The Registration fee would be between $500-$750, basically if you recall I did brief you after your university interaction with multiple universities, you would have to reserve your seat in 1 particular university you would have to pay a registration fee. Now usually Registration fee for a student is a separate expense altogether, however for an Edoofian it is considered a part of the first year's annual fee.

Say suppose, after the scholarship your fee is $2200, and you are being asked to pay $500 as a registration fee.

Now, being an Edoofa Applicant you have the privilege here of the registration fee being adjusted against your Tuition fee.

Hence the amount of $500 paid as registration fee will be waived off from your Fee and after that, the balance of ($2200-$500=$1700) has to be paid after coming to India in August/September of the year you come in 2 installments. The first part will be $1000 which you will pay in August 2025 and the remaining $700 in January 2026.

3. The Annual fee after the scholarship as discussed above would be between $2000-$3000, and this would include *Accommodation, Food Expenses, and Basic University Expenses such as exam fees, Library Fee, and Lab Fee* However if a student is able to clear the Eligibility Check test and Interview with over 90 marks, a student is eligible to get a 90% to 100% scholarship where the Annual fee after the scholarship would be between *$1250-$1500*, which would include *Accommodation, Food Expenses, and Basic University Expenses such as exam fees, Library Fee, and Lab Fee*
26/01/24, 12:52 pm - +263 77 313 2450: It's clear now. How long does it take, like after paying $350 enrolment fee to pay  reg fee $500-$750?
26/01/24, 12:54 pm - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: @263773132450 Since the admission is for 2025 intake, you would have time to pay the registration fee monthly in installments not more than $200 itself. <This message was edited>
26/01/24, 12:55 pm - +263 77 313 2450: Ok noted. So can we start the enrollment process early May 2024?
26/01/24, 12:59 pm - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: @263773132450 now for that it would be difficult since by May, we cannot predict how many scholarship seats would be left for 2025 intake that too with what quantum. As a parent I am sure you want your child to have the maximum scholarship quantum, isn't it?
26/01/24, 1:02 pm - +263 77 313 2450: Its true. What if l try end of February
26/01/24, 1:12 pm - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: @263773132450 I understand your challenge and let me see what best can be done so that Britney doesn't end up loosing this chance please!
26/01/24, 1:12 pm - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: While I do plan for the same, I would like to ask you a few questions, but before that with immense pleasure, I would like to share the glimpses of the Africa Visit of our Founders which took place in June 2023! 

*It was a much-awaited event and they were welcomed by Ministries, Educationalists, Edoofians, and Parents across different African Countries. This is a must-watch video depicting the Acceptance of the Program in the African Continent, especially in Zimbabwe!!*
26/01/24, 1:13 pm - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: <Media omitted>
26/01/24, 1:35 pm - +263 77 313 2450: Thank you
29/01/24, 8:43 am - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: Good Morning @263773132450
29/01/24, 8:43 am - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: I hope you had a blessed weekend please?
29/01/24, 10:04 am - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: I had a chance to discuss Britney's application with the Board once again. As per the acting policies and standards the Academic Board is not viable to change the 7 day deadline period. However, after careful consideration, they are willing to consider that if Britney is found eligible for the Edoofa Program and if the student/family faces a challenge in completing the required $200 then you can complete a part fee of $100 within the first 7 days, and remaining $100 could be completed in the next 14 days. Moreover, the pending amount of $150 is to be paid in the next 30 days. All in all for $350 you will have about 52 days to complete the formalities.

I hope this is convenient to you and your family please?
29/01/24, 10:59 am - +263 77 313 2450: Thank you. We will try to pay the $100 on Monday next week. Good morning
29/01/24, 11:00 am - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: Alright @263773132450 since this seems to be convenient for your family, shall I get the interview slots for today please?
29/01/24, 11:03 am - +263 77 313 2450: My network is weak today I am working out of office. I will be back on Wednesday.
29/01/24, 11:04 am - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: @263773132450 the interview is for Britney, while you could acknowledge the interview once you are done with your work for the day please!
29/01/24, 11:09 am - +263 77 313 2450: Is 1730hrs ok with you
