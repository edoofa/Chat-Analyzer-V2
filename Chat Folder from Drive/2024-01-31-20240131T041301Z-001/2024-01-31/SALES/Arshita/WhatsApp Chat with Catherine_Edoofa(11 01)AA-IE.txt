I learned that Edoofa  program is a partial scholarship that helps many students who couldn't afford to fulfill thay dreams .Being part of Edoofa also teaches people to value hardwork , skill development and never gibing up. Also that the EWYL program has been of great help to many students as they can self finance themselves.

I am a hardworking , intelligent and  a fast thinker . I make sure that in everything I do I put all my focus and excel in it .
I believe that the edoofa scholarship is targeting all the intelligent students so that they can excel and I do believe I'm one of those students.

22/01/24, 10:47 am - Arshita: Noted
22/01/24, 10:47 am - Arshita: Let me brief you that, I want to brief you that the criteria before the pandemic was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is *a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.
22/01/24, 10:58 am - +263 78 497 6551: Yah , i am
22/01/24, 10:59 am - Arshita: As your evaluation progresses, I appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country. In this process did you do any prior research on foreign education or applied to any University abroad?
22/01/24, 11:00 am - +263 78 497 6551: Yes I did
22/01/24, 11:00 am - +263 78 497 6551: They were scholarships being offered in Canada
22/01/24, 11:02 am - Arshita: *“Education is not the filling of a pot but the lighting of a fire.”– W.B. Yeats*
With my experience, I have come across many students who have a dream of studying abroad but fail to find a reliable source. They often fall for brokers/agents with no distant aim for future career. It may also be possible that you would have come across any University publicizing for Admissions from the UK, Australia, Poland, or even India. We want you to understand the difference between a Scholarship Program that has an end goal of making you individually employment-ready, and agents luring you for University Admissions abroad. 

I hereby request you to go through this detailed article to compare your previous experiences if you had one. You can feel free to share the Name of the University you applied to or the Name of the Organization that offered you admission at any of the Universities. Let me know as soon as you have gone through and I will be guiding you through your program details.
22/01/24, 11:02 am - Arshita: <Media omitted>
22/01/24, 11:02 am - Arshita: Let me know once you are done
