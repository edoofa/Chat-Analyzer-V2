20/01/24, 11:45 am - Keshav Edoofa: I am glad you liked India Mary!
20/01/24, 11:46 am - Keshav Edoofa: I hope you must have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead. As of now would you like to ask anything so far?
20/01/24, 11:48 am - +263 71 784 1345: So far no questions at all
20/01/24, 11:49 am - Keshav Edoofa: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
20/01/24, 11:49 am - Keshav Edoofa: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
20/01/24, 11:49 am - Keshav Edoofa: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
20/01/24, 11:49 am - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>
20/01/24, 11:49 am - Keshav Edoofa: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
20/01/24, 11:58 am - +263 71 784 1345: This is one is affordable
20/01/24, 12:05 pm - Keshav Edoofa: In simple words Mary what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
20/01/24, 12:07 pm - +263 71 784 1345: The Earn While You Learn Program what it about
20/01/24, 12:11 pm - Keshav Edoofa: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in

20/01/24, 12:11 pm - Keshav Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase. 

*What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
20/01/24, 1:34 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you *Monday again at 9:30 AM CAT* to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care and do watch the video I am sharing below.

Have a good day ahead. 
God Bless You!
22/01/24, 8:30 am - Keshav Edoofa: Hello Mary , Good Morning, Hope you are doing well

As discussed, I am here for us to continue with your application, so shall we start?
22/01/24, 3:19 pm - +263 77 354 2549: Greetings,by way of introduction l am Gwengo Masara, Mary's father.l am 49years ,being the last born in a peasant family of eight.I was born and bred in the heart of the country side but l was lucky to attend both my primary and secondary education at the mission school.l enrolled for my primary and secondary education at a Catholic mission school and proceeded for my Advanced level at a Reformed mission school,after which l enrolled at college as a primary school teacher and later joined the public service in my capacity as a classroom teacher to date.Safely to say these places gave me the awakening and inspiration to value the human investment of allowing children to expand their dream horizons by advancing academically to match global standards that enrich them with self efficacy and a robust recognition of otherness in doing so.
22/01/24, 3:46 pm - Keshav Edoofa: It was really great to know you Mr. Masara
22/01/24, 3:46 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I am glad you as a parent are keeping track of your child's future opportunity that awaits for him to get him able to be successful ahead

Also, I really appreciate your efforts and support for your child's education, you are awesome, Kudos!
22/01/24, 3:46 pm - Keshav Edoofa: May i know when will Mary be available to continue the session?\
22/01/24, 3:50 pm - +263 77 354 2549: You are welcome Sir,thanks for the exhortation,but most of all l am really sorry for the delay
22/01/24, 3:50 pm - +263 77 354 2549: Ok,l feel just now if l may raise her
22/01/24, 3:52 pm - +263 71 784 1345: I am here sir
22/01/24, 3:53 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Did you get the hold of this information?
22/01/24, 3:53 pm - Keshav Edoofa: What do you think about the same?
22/01/24, 4:03 pm - +263 71 784 1345: I believe that these webinars have the potential to greatly benefit me, not only in terms of employment prospects but also in personal growth and development. I am excited to embrace the opportunities presented by being an Edoofian and to apply the knowledge and skills gained through these webinars to excel in my future endeavors.
22/01/24, 4:05 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I am delighted to hear that Mary, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
22/01/24, 4:06 pm - +263 71 784 1345: Ok
22/01/24, 4:07 pm - Keshav Edoofa: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

22/01/24, 4:08 pm - Keshav Edoofa: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
22/01/24, 4:18 pm - +263 71 784 1345: I'm really excited about the opportunity to be part of such a dynamic and supportive community.  The financial aid aspect is also a huge advantage, as it empowers students like me to self-sponsor  higher education.
22/01/24, 4:18 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I really resonate with your thoughts Mary
22/01/24, 4:19 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
22/01/24, 4:20 pm - +263 71 784 1345: Yes
22/01/24, 4:23 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Mary as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?
22/01/24, 4:27 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Well , I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you *tomorrow again at 9:30 AM CAT* to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care and do watch the video I am sharing below.

Have a good day ahead. 
God Bless You!
22/01/24, 4:28 pm - +263 71 784 1345: $1500-2250
23/01/24, 9:26 am - Keshav Edoofa: Hello , Good Morning, Hope you are doing well

As discussed, I am here for us to continue with your application, so shall we start?
23/01/24, 9:35 am - +263 71 784 1345: This message was deleted
23/01/24, 9:36 am - +263 71 784 1345: Morning Mr Keshav ...We can continue
23/01/24, 9:46 am - Keshav Edoofa: Exactly Mary, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
23/01/24, 9:57 am - +263 71 784 1345: I am looking forward to have a scholarship
23/01/24, 9:57 am - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/01/24, 9:57 am - Keshav Edoofa: *But, as we know the COVID-19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350* <This message was edited>
23/01/24, 10:00 am - +263 71 784 1345: Noted
23/01/24, 10:01 am - Keshav Edoofa: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university zapplications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
23/01/24, 11:59 am - +263 71 784 1345: Its empressive to see how edoofa is revolutionilising the admission process for international students. Iam eager to explore the possibilities and take  advantages of the services Edoofa offers.
23/01/24, 12:01 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
23/01/24, 12:01 pm - Keshav Edoofa: You see Edoofa's exceptional program has opened up a world of opportunities for aspiring students, garnering thousands of applications on a daily basis. The Eligibility Evaluation process ensures that deserving candidates are granted the chance to participate in the program. *Once accepted, students are requested to pay a nominal Program Fee of $350 within 7 days of receiving their acceptance letter*, following which they commence with their admission process and the esteemed Earn While You Learn Program. Edoofa's mission to provide quality education and support to students is at the heart of this initiative, and we are honored to make a difference in the lives of deserving individuals through this program.
23/01/24, 12:01 pm - Keshav Edoofa: However Mary as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.* <This message was edited>
23/01/24, 12:04 pm - +263 71 784 1345: Ok l think this will be much easier for the parents to pay
23/01/24, 12:42 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Yes Mary and I hope that you have understood how it totally depends upon the student to make his/her higher education affordable with the help of the Earn While You Learn Program's Scholarship Credits?
23/01/24, 4:43 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Well I was expecting your response to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you *Thursday again at 9:30 AM CAT* to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care and do watch the video I am sharing below.

Have a good day ahead. 
God Bless You!
23/01/24, 4:43 pm - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>
25/01/24, 8:37 am - Keshav Edoofa: Hello Mary and Mr. Masara, Good Morning, Hope you are doing well

As discussed, I am here for us to continue with your application, so shall we start?
25/01/24, 9:00 am - +263 71 784 1345: Morning Mr Keshav

25/01/24, 9:37 am - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>
25/01/24, 9:37 am - Keshav Edoofa: Alright Mary, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zimbabwe itself. <This message was edited>
25/01/24, 9:38 am - Keshav Edoofa: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
25/01/24, 9:41 am - +263 71 784 1345: Clear and concise

25/01/24, 9:45 am - Keshav Edoofa: Basically, this registration fee will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August/September 2024 and the remaining in January next year 2025.
25/01/24, 9:45 am - Keshav Edoofa: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
25/01/24, 9:45 am - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>
25/01/24, 9:45 am - Keshav Edoofa: Here is a picture of the Visa of one of the Edoofian who arrived in India, for 2023 Academic Intake.

29/01/24, 10:15 am - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/01/24, 10:15 am - +263 77 354 2549: As a family and  Mary's parents we read and understood the counselling process and to this regard we have no questions so far

Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage.
If a person suddenly encounters any terrible danger, the change of nature one undergoes is equally great. Sometimes fear numbs our senses. Like animals, one stands still, powerless to move a step in fright or to lift a hand in defense of our lives, and sometimes one is seized with panic, and again, act more like the inferior animals than rational beings. On the other hand, frequently in cases of sudden extreme peril, which cannot be escaped by flight, and must be instantly faced, even the most timid men at once as if by miracle, become possessed of the necessary courage, sharp quick apprehension and swift decision. This is a miracle very common in nature. Man and the inferior animals alike, when confronted with almost certain death ‘ gather resolution from despair’ but there can really be no trace of so debilitating a feeling in the person fighting, or prepared to fight for dear life. At such times the mind is clearer than it has ever been; the nerves are steel, there is nothing felt but a wonderful strength and daring. Looking back at certain perilous moments in my own life, I remember them with a kind of joy, not that there was any joyful excitement then, but because they broadened my horizon, lifted me for a time above myself.

Whey to Go Greek yogurt—a strained form of cultured yogurt—has grown enormously in popularity in the United States since it was first introduced in the country in the late 1980s. From 2011 to 2012 alone, sales of Greek yogurt in the US increased by 50 percent. The resulting increase in Greek yogurt production has forced those involved in the business to address the detrimental effects that the yogurt-making process may be having on the environment. Fortunately, farmers and others in the Greek yogurt business have found many methods of controlling and eliminating most environmental threats. Given these solutions as well as the many health benefits of the food, the advantages of Greek yogurt Q5. outdo the potential drawbacks of its production.Sentence [1] The main environmental problem caused by the production of Greek yogurt is the creation of acid whey as a by-product.Sentence [2] Because it requires up to four times more milk to make than conventional yogurt does, Greek yogurt produces larger amounts of acid whey, which is difficult to dispose of.Sentence [3] To address the problem of disposal, farmers have found a number of uses for acid whey. Sentence[4] They can add it to livestock feed as a protein Q.6. supplement and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt. Sentence[5] If it is improperly introduced into the environment, acid-whey runoff Q.7. can pollute waterways, depleting the oxygen content of streams and rivers as it decomposes.

In life we all face problems that test our resilience and ditermination .My journey is a testament to the power of peserverance and the belief that anything is possible.From a young age ,i struggled with learning that made traditional education as constant battles .Teachers often dismissed my potential leaving me defeated and undervalued.However i refused to let my circumstances define me .I learned valuable lessons about resillience ,patience and the importance of not giving up on my dreams .I studied harder each and everyday in an attempt to prove everyone wrong .I hope my story can serve as a source of inspiration for others embarking on their own journeys of resilience.
29/01/24, 12:27 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Mary ,While I get your test evaluated, I have your interview slots, however before I shared the interview slots I would like you and your parents as well to answer a few of my questions.

So I wanted to ask that for the same, so could you and your parent be online for the next 20 minutes to answer my question?

29/01/24, 12:30 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Mr. Masara and Mrs Zezai you see as per my experience over the last couple of years, I have been fortunate to have assisted over hundreds of students in achieving their career aspiration through the Edoofa Program. 

One of my key observations during helping out these students was regarding what was the common trait amongst students who are today having the best of their time in India through the Edoofa Program, and honestly I was able to come down to only one aspect that is FAMILY SUPPORT.
29/01/24, 12:30 pm - Keshav Edoofa: You see in this journey of any child's higher education, there are three major contributors 

1. Student himself/herself
2. FAMILY
3. EDOOFA PROGAM

Now all the students who are today successfully a part of the Edoofa Program, had all these three contributors working together towards the common goal which is student's success and ensuring that by the time student completes his/her higher education they should be able to get good paying jobs. 

Even if any one of the contributor does not perform to the best of their abilities, Student's overall success is hampered. Let me give you a few examples

*In the event if student wishes to work hard, Edoofa is willing to support but the Family is not willing to support, the student will not be successful under the program*

*In the event if student wishes to work hard, Family is willing to support, but Edoofa's academic Board doesn't find the student worthy, the student will not be successful under the program*

*In the event if Family is willing to support, Edoofa's Academic Board is willing to support but the student doesn't wishes to work hard, then also the student will not be successful under the program*
29/01/24, 12:31 pm - Keshav Edoofa: During the evaluation of your child's application so far, the Academic Board has evaluated a few aspects, such as student's willingness to work hard, and family's willingness to support the student so that the student can achieve what he/she has aspired. However now in your interview ahead, the Academic Board would be strictly be evaluating the Family's support towards the child higher education. 

*As you know in the event if your child is found eligible, you would have to complete a certain part of the formalities within the 7 day timeline, so may I know regarding the same, are you willing to support your child to the fullest?*
29/01/24, 12:33 pm - +263 77 441 6421: Yes
29/01/24, 12:34 pm - +263 77 354 2549: Oh yes Sir
29/01/24, 12:36 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Excellent Mr. Masara and Mrs. Zezai, I really admire your willingness to see your child succeed!
 Can you please acknowledge the same using voice note please?
29/01/24, 12:37 pm - +263 77 441 6421: <Media omitted>
29/01/24, 12:37 pm - +263 77 354 2549: <Media omitted>
29/01/24, 12:39 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
29/01/24, 12:39 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
29/01/24, 12:39 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below
29/01/24, 12:39 pm - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/01/24, 12:41 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I hope now you know Ideally, the tentative dates:

1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 4th or 5th of February 2024 for $200 and the 4th or 5th of March for the remaining $150.

2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 4th or 5th of February 2024 

Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?
