18/01/24, 3:18 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Good Afternoon Thokozile and Mrs. Tshuma!

*I am Mr Keshav, Career Counsellor at Edoofa.*

We have received an application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program from Noah

I hope I have contacted the right person.

I would like you to come online so that I could discuss with you the form you submitted online and what I was able to understand from the same!
18/01/24, 3:19 pm - +263 71 797 1883: Hie
18/01/24, 3:20 pm - +263 71 797 1883: Yes it's the right person
18/01/24, 3:20 pm - Keshav Edoofa: It is a pleasure to connect with you today,

You can address me as Mr. Keshav and we do have Mr. Piyush, Head of Counseling, who will be evaluating your responses for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.

Also do note that my working hours are *9:00 am to 4:30 pm CAT Monday to Friday*. Your active participation would be greatly appreciated.
18/01/24, 3:22 pm - +263 71 797 1883: Thank you, will certainly adhere to what you are saying
18/01/24, 3:22 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Great Thokozile!
18/01/24, 3:23 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Okay so, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
18/01/24, 3:25 pm - +263 71 797 1883: Yes i do have what it takes to meet the standards needed
18/01/24, 3:25 pm - Keshav Edoofa: That is the spirit Thokozile!, Amazing

But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

19/01/24, 12:12 pm - Keshav Edoofa: BSW, also termed as Bachelor of Social Work is a 3 year undergraduate degree course that provides knowledge and skills to work in the social sector, aiming to provide quality life as well as education. Social Work, as the name suggests, aims to provide each and every citizen, specifically the less priviledged ones, a dignified life worth living with all aspects of social amenities and equal justice.

*What is BSW Course*
BSW is a three-year undergraduate professional degree course majoring in the field of social work. A typical BSW degree course lasts three years and is broken down into six semesters.  In certain circumstances, candidates are required to finish the program within a maximum of six years. Candidates can enroll in BSW full-time or even as a correspondence or distance learning degree. There are three main components to the BSW course: the foundation course, the elective course, and the fieldwork.

BSW courses can be pursued in various colleges in the country. It is useful to candidates who may like to work in social welfare sectors as it helps them acquire professional skills and knowledge to help the clients deal with their emotional and psychological problems. The curriculum provides social work education and training based on indigenous knowledge. It helps the learner to develop the required attitudes in understanding people’s problem-solving interventions.

*Why Study BSW*
BSW is apt for candidates interested in providing professional assistance to people in need. 

-BSW is specially meant for the ones who are aiming at improving the quality of life of the poorest of the poor and understand the growing demand for professionally trained social workers across the country.

25/01/24, 10:19 am - Keshav Edoofa: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
25/01/24, 10:19 am - Keshav Edoofa: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
25/01/24, 10:19 am - Keshav Edoofa: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.

25/01/24, 10:24 am - +263 71 797 1883: So let's say i get a 50% scholarship, how much will i be paying
25/01/24, 10:27 am - Keshav Edoofa: In simple words Thokozile what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
25/01/24, 10:30 am - +263 71 797 1883: Ok ok, so i will be working while learning in order to cover up expenses, i think that's a better deal
25/01/24, 10:31 am - Keshav Edoofa: Exactly Thokozile
25/01/24, 10:31 am - Keshav Edoofa: Shall i move ahead and brief you about the EWYL program!?
25/01/24, 10:33 am - +263 71 797 1883: Sure go ahead
25/01/24, 10:34 am - Keshav Edoofa: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in
25/01/24, 10:34 am - Keshav Edoofa: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it.

25/01/24, 10:34 am - Keshav Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.
