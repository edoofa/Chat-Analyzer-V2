I grew up in the rural areas of Chibi, Zimbabwe with my grand mother...

And My mother is a teacher and my father is a general hand miner at Hwange Colliery Company......

So I can say I came from a privileged background.....

Education 

I did my Primary educational studies at Mukotosi Primary School which is located at the Hub of Chivi Rural Area....
I have secured 8 units for the Grade 7 ZIMSEC the examinations.....

For the Secondary School
My parents were pleased with the grade Seven results so my Grandmother and my parents worked hand in glove through selling cattle for financing my studies.....

And The Almighty seen their endeavours and blessed me with 11 A 's out of the 11 subjects I have sat for....

Then for Advanced level....
The Almighty God also grant me an opportunity to attend My A level at Chibi High school. Through the Member of Parliament Scholarships for our constituency.....

And the recently released Zimsec A level Results.....

Your journey is truly commendable, and it reflects your dedication and hard work in pursuit of education. Growing up in the rural areas of Chibi, Zimbabwe, and overcoming challenges to secure excellent results at both the primary and secondary levels showcase your resilience and commitment. The support from your family, especially Mrs. Sharai's role as a teacher and Mr. Shepherd's dedication as a general hand miner, highlights the value your family places on education. Your academic achievements, marked by 11 A's at O level and an impressive 30 points at A level, are a testament to your intellectual prowess! I have confidence that you are an exceptionally diligent student, and you will undoubtedly demonstrate your capabilities if given the right guidance! Could you kindly shed more light on the professions your parents pertain to, please?

23/01/24, 11:18 am - +263 78 965 4520: My mother is a Primary Teacher who works at Lusumbami Primary which is located in Lusumbami Village.......
She holds a diploma in teaching.......

Apparently my Father is a general hand miner at Hwange Colliery Company Underground department......
He doesn't have any educational accolades but he toiled to make the ends meet for us...

He works in Hwange Colliery Company for 21 years.....

And he chooses the underground department so that the allowances he might got there will also be beneficial to the family despite risking his life......

So the underground machinery are delapted so they have been suspended until new ones are brought in for production........
23/01/24, 11:21 am - +263 78 965 4520: But he never gives up 

Currently he is working at the Battery sub station at  Hwange and the working conditions are very risky because they are skyrocketing cases for  burns so they use fire a plethora of times......
23/01/24, 11:28 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I want to express my deep admiration for your parents, who exhibit extraordinary dedication and resilience in their respective roles. Mrs. Sharai's commitment to education as a primary teacher at Lusumbami Primary, armed with a teaching diploma, showcases her passion for nurturing young minds. Simultaneously, Mr. Shepherd's unwavering commitment to Hwange Colliery Company for an impressive 21 years, especially in the demanding underground department, reflects his strong work ethic and sacrifice for the family's well-being. His willingness to face challenges head-on, even in the risky conditions of the Battery substation, demonstrates incredible strength and determination. Their combined efforts in providing for the family amid challenges are truly commendable!
23/01/24, 11:29 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So, could you kindly tell me how much *Chibi High School* charges you every term, and who in your family financially supports your education?
23/01/24, 11:31 am - +263 78 965 4520: I was being helped by MP Mr Molokele
He was the one who was paying my school fees .....

And due to the science subject I was doing.....

The school fees was $550....
23/01/24, 11:31 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Since pursuing higher education is a significant undertaking that demands both mental and financial support, may I know who will be financially supporting your education abroad?
23/01/24, 11:38 am - +263 78 965 4520: I am afraid to say 

The financial status of my parents is limited in such a way that they cannot afford to cater for my education abroad .....


And for my A level, my educational process was being financed by MP Molokele and my parents were catering for books and other stationary only
