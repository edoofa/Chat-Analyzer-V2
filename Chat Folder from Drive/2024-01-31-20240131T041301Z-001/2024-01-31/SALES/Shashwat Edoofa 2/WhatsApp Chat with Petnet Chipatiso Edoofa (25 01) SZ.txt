25/01/24, 4:46 pm - +263 78 219 1395: OK. My name is Petnet Chipatiso. The first and only daughter in a family of 4 children. Petnet grew up in a humble family and this led her to be passionate, aspire and excel in education the key to success. I attained 10 subjects at O level  including Maths, English and Science at Nyamuroro Kubatana High school in Gokwe. I went further and attained 11 points at A level doing a combination of Literature, Divinity and History at Herentals Group of Colleges. To fulfill my dreams with the grace of God and the help of my late aunt l managed to proceed to Midlands State  university ( MSU) and obtained a BA Honour's in Development Studies. Growing up in hardships and experiencing my parents finding it hard to make ends meet and sometimes my siblings failing to go to school, it became my desire to see it that my siblings would not face life desperate and perturbed as l did. It also became my objective that l would raise the standards of living for my parents. Currently lm teaching accounts and commerce at a local  school in my neighborhood called Vibrant Private College. Im interested in transforming the lives of these children for the better. One of my greatest achievement of all was to live a selfless, sacrificing life and l have done this by teaching free extra lessons for children in my community. I'm optimistic sir that this opportunity will open wide doors in my life to elevate and help my family and community.

Could you kindly shed more light on the professions your parents pertain to, please?
29/01/24, 11:45 am - +263 78 219 1395: Thank you so much sir for the wise words and motivation. In regards to the last question you posed. My dad is a janitor at Seventh Day Adventist Church. and my mum is a security officer at Modern security.

29/01/24, 12:00 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So, could you kindly tell me how much *Midlands State University* charges you every semester, and who in your family financially supports your education?
29/01/24, 12:01 pm - +263 78 219 1395: Yes that's true sir and l salute them for that
29/01/24, 12:13 pm - +263 78 219 1395: OK thank you for that question.  Well based on the experience l had MSU charged from $300-$400. During my time there was a fees hike and fluctuation of tuition maybe due to economic issues. When l commenced for my undergrad the first semester up until 2:1 my parents took a loan to fund my tuition fee but then it was straining due to the interest that was charged which caused my siblings to have a backlog of tuition arrears as a result being sent away by school. That's when my aunt came into play and decided to take over from my parents and pay the tuition fee up until l finished. As for my accommodation because l was at MSU Zvishavane l had to stay at the house of my close relative my uncle (elder brother to my dad) so he is the one who one catered for accommodation and food with the help of my parents as well.
29/01/24, 1:46 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Since pursuing higher education is a significant undertaking that demands both mental and financial support, may I know who will be financially supporting your education abroad? <This message was edited>
29/01/24, 3:15 pm - +263 78 219 1395: Well on that one sir it will be a joint venture between my parents and l. Since lm now working l would see to it that l save some pennies so as to cut the burden for my parents as well as seek for fully funded scholarships.
