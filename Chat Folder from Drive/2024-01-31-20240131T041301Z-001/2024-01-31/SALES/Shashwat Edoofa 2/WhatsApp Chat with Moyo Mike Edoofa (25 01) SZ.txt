25/01/24, 10:32 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I hope you are having a wonderful day, Mr. Boniface!
25/01/24, 10:32 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So shall we start the session?
25/01/24, 1:10 pm - +263 77 686 8620: Yes
25/01/24, 1:53 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Glad to hear that, I will be taking you through all the aspects of the Edoofa Program but just before that, I would like to know you better as a parent. 

Kindly share a bit about yourself, what you do, what is your highest qualification, and what motivates you to support your son ahead for education. Additionally, you can add more about your family like the number of children, details of your spouse, etc.

Could you shed some light on what kind of student do you feel your son is, what are his strengths and weaknesses and how would you describe your child as a person, please?
25/01/24, 3:00 pm - +263 77 686 8620: Okay, thank you. My name is Boniface Moyo born on the 20th of July 1980. I grew up in a small town called Serima in Masvingo Province in Zimbabwe as you know. I then relocated to Beitbridge at the age of 18 and started working to support my parents and siblings in the rural areas. I wrote my O'levels at Chiriga and didn't do quite well, that's when I left school. I just tried hustling there and there. I don't have a professional job.  I have four children, three girls and one boy. Mike Moyo is the only boy. I am married to Nokuthula Munyamani and she didn't get to finish her O'levels. My wife doesn't go to work, she is a housewife. My son is a really hardworking boy, who went through a rough patch in school due to failure to pay tuition fees and provision of basic necessities for school. Even though he went through all these things, he still prevailed and passed. That gives me motivation as a parent to try and support my son throughout his educational journey. He is a humble and caring student that we think might excel in life and acquire great things. 


My son is a very bright and intelligent student. He is very hardworking and very persistent. He achieved a lot in his education even though there were so many obstacles. My son had great strengths in communication, he is very good at communicating his feelings and providing assurance when assigned anything. He is very hardworking, he is also very good at public speaking, he is very kind, humble and caring. He carries himself with great pride and dignity and is also very principled. He does everything by the book & carries great moral accord. The two weaknesses that I know about is he does not know how to retaliate when being fought. He always responds with kindness. And the other one is he wants everything to be perfect. He beats himself up if anything he did, doesn't come out perfect. I hope what I have said gives you an insight of what you wanted to know.

Your journey from Serima to Beitbridge, and your dedication to supporting your family despite facing challenges, reflects your resilience and commitment. Mike stands as a testament to your parenting, showcasing exceptional qualities of hard work, intelligence, humility, and kindness. His ability to overcome obstacles and excel academically is a testament to his character. As a parent, your motivation to support him in his educational journey is admirable. Mike's strengths in communication, public speaking, kindness, humility, and moral principles are commendable. Even in the face of challenges, he maintains a positive and principled approach. Your insights offer a glimpse into the remarkable qualities of your son, and your unwavering support undoubtedly contributes to his success! Could you kindly shed light on the educational background of Mike's siblings, please?
30/01/24, 9:09 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Good Morning, Everyone! I sincerely apologize for any inconvenience caused by the technical difficulties my device experienced, which temporarily affected our communication. I'm pleased to inform you that the issues have been resolved. *I would be delighted to resume our sessions and propose reconnecting at 10:00 A.M. CAT*. Your continued engagement is highly appreciated, and I look forward to our fruitful and interactive sessions.
30/01/24, 8:37 pm - +263 77 686 8620: Thank you, for taking an interest in my son. That alone, is a blessing to me. Mike is the second born. The first born is a girl named Emmaculate Moyo. She is studying banking and Investment Management at National University of Science and Technology (NUST) in Zimbabwe. She is now doing her final year, we are expecting her to graduate in November. She is very intelligent and did remarkably well during her A'level and O'level studies. She was awarded the best student in commercial class at Serima in 2019, with 13 points. We do struggle a lot to provide her with tuition fees and we got help from the church. Mike's other sibling is Amanda Moyo who is currently doing form 3 at Pamushana High School. Which is one of the best schools in academics and ball games, like soccer in Zimbabwe. It was hard for us to send her there since we were broke but we got help from friends and families. She is very bright and intelligent so people were very willing to help in order to give her a better future. So are expecting her to excel in her O'level studies next year. The last one is in Primary school, in grade 5 at a local school in Beitbridge and her name is Angel Nyasha Moyo
