25/01/24, 9:43 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, if you had researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any *Healthcare course* in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*. whereas if they want to study any *Engineering Course* then they should have *Physics and Maths* in their A level mandatorily.
25/01/24, 10:44 am - +263 77 188 4250: alright sir, eeeh i think tanaka will answer these by the time he comes back fron school because some of these l dont have any knowledge about them. but what  l relly know is that he is not studying physics。
