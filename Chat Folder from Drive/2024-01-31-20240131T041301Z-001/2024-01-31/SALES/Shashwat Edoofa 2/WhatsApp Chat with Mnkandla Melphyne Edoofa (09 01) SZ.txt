Your ambitions to work in a laboratory, fueled by your love for experimenting, researching, and your keen interest in calculations, demonstrate a focused and determined mindset towards a career aligned with your strengths and interests. Moreover, your dedication to education and your accomplishments despite facing challenges is truly commendable, Melphyne!

Her sacrifices and resilience are evident, especially during challenging times like the COVID-19 pandemic.

If given the opportunity to pursue a baking course, there is no doubt that she would not only excel but also emerge as a star in the world of baking.

17/01/24, 9:46 am - +263 77 991 8011: Studying abroad came into my mind when I was in  high school.I noticed that here in Zimbabwe you find someone with a degree sitting at home because of lack of employment.Am not saying all but most of them are not employed . I guess that's because of our economic system ( it's very low).Those who studied abroad are doing great in their life.Its very rare to find someone who studied abroad unemployed.The other thing our network system is very low therefore we struggle a lot when it comes to do research and online studies .
 When studying abroad you get to learn different people, different languages, different cultures and norms .
17/01/24, 9:47 am - +263 77 991 8011: <Media omitted>
17/01/24, 10:06 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I truly admire your vision, Melphyne! Exposure to foreign tertiary education offers numerous advantages. It broadens students' horizons by introducing them to diverse cultures and perspectives, improving language skills, and providing a global outlook. They gain access to world-class academic institutions, form international networks, and develop invaluable personal and professional skills. This experience fosters personal growth, enhances career prospects, and cultivates global citizenship. In essence, studying abroad is a transformative journey that equips students with the knowledge, skills, and perspective needed to thrive in our interconnected world!
17/01/24, 10:06 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: May I kindly enquire about your activities and endeavors since 2021, please?
17/01/24, 11:04 am - +263 77 991 8011: I have been working in a butchery for 6 months now.Started selling perfumes  3months back
17/01/24, 11:39 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Your versatility and adaptability are truly commendable as you've seamlessly transitioned from working in a butchery for six months to venturing into the world of perfume sales for the past three months. This not only showcases your ability to thrive in diverse environments but also highlights your courage in exploring new opportunities. May I know whether you are mentally and financially ready to commence with your tertiary education, please?
17/01/24, 2:26 pm - +263 77 991 8011: Yes, I am ready.

It's actually an amazing thing to deal with chemicals ,medicines and some other substances found in a Laboratory.
17/01/24, 3:14 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Could you kindly share your thoughts on the career field that captivates you the most and the origins of your interest? Your insights, along with any specific experiences that ignited your fascination for this field, would be greatly appreciated?
17/01/24, 9:13 pm - +263 77 991 8011: I think Laboratory technician jobs are great for anyone who likes working independently but also want to be part of a team in the medical profession.
This role presents an opportunity for me to build up my past success, contribute my skills and knowledge and drive even greater results . There are many reasons why I want to be a medical laboratory technician .I have always been interested in the field of science, performing experiments and this career allows me to do that.I do not want to be in a situation where I would be constantly working at a desk.I like work activities that have to do with ideas .

I believe it is a very crucial science subject, isn't it?
29/01/24, 4:56 pm - +263 77 991 8011: It is a crucial subject indeed but I was suppose to choose between Physics and Biology.I decided to go for physics because I passed it with a better symbol at O'level.I loved physics more than biology.I had this belief that girls who studied physics have advantages when going to tertiary level since it is believed that it's a difficult subject .Inshot , I loved physics therefore , at tertiary level I wanted to study something that has more of physics than biology .
