17/01/24, 8:39 am - Kunal: Greetings to you all

I was waiting for you to share your concerns with me but unfortunately, I didn’t hear from you and therefore I was asked to put your application on hold, but before doing the same, I was going through the form you submitted, I noticed that you come from a family background wherein you plan to pursue your higher education abroad and was looking for a scholarship. I am looking forward to hearing from you so that I can make your dream of higher education abroad come true through an affordable, accessible, and employment-oriented higher education program.

*Please Note by tomorrow*, I would have to submit my final response regarding your application, so failure to get back to me would mean cancellation of your application after which you would have to re-apply
17/01/24, 9:24 am - +263 77 237 1173: Goodmorning Kunah

Thanks so much for your effort we really appreciate. Tinovimba is at school now doing her A level at Zrp High. Am the father but currently am working in Sudan as UN peace keeper. Situation here its fragile so will  only find time during weekends. Please try to put me on the program weekend so that I can also have enough time for interaction. We are very much grateful to help her pursue her dreams and we have no doubt upon her. We are so much interested but need to have an interactive platform conducive for is all.

Regards
