20/11/23, 1:28 pm - +263 77 895 6269: My name's Prosper Moyo. I've always been skilled at working toward common goals and working hard. Also, i do not hesitate to try new things.

Time management is one of my biggest weaknesses. This is because i have always paid close attention to detail, hence at times i take longer than i anticipate to complete a task. This is why i started using time table, to guide me in time management.This has tirned out to be my weakness or challenge.

First of all, I'm into photography  and tech. I also like music, reading, and cooking.

I wrote my A level examinations this year, and i am currently waiting for the results. The subjects I did were History, Family and Religious Studies, and also Literature in Ndebele.

I want to study LLB. This is because it will help me in critical thinking and problem solving, which may also be applicable in life. Also, LLB will allow me to make a difference. This isin tetms of people in general, business and communities. It will also help me develop business development skills. Moreover, i am also passionate about legal matters.

My parents are currently self employed.

My parent's highest education level is O level, that is form 4.


I do have siblings, 3 of them actually. They are all at school.

My education has been funded by  an organisation named HIGHERLIFE FOUNDATION.

My fees were $200USD per term
20/11/23, 1:36 pm - Austin: It's great to learn more about you. Your strengths in teamwork and willingness to try new things will undoubtedly contribute to a dynamic student community.
20/11/23, 1:37 pm - Austin: May I know the nature of the job of your parents within self employment?
20/11/23, 1:37 pm - Austin: I see you are well motivated towards this career path in Law and looking forward to excelling in it

13/12/23, 1:11 pm - Kunal: Thank you for sharing
13/12/23, 1:11 pm - Kunal: I want to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it
13/12/23, 1:17 pm - +263 77 895 6269: Yes i am
13/12/23, 1:22 pm - Kunal: Good to hear that

13/12/23, 1:45 pm - +263 77 895 6269: YES please

By any chance are you familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship?
18/12/23, 3:04 pm - +263 77 895 6269: No i'm not
18/12/23, 3:04 pm - Kunal: Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth! 

In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc,it is still beyond the reach of many.
With the Edoofa Scholarship Program,the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library,Wifi,Laundry,etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
18/12/23, 3:04 pm - Kunal: This message was deleted
18/12/23, 3:05 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
18/12/23, 3:05 pm - Kunal: In simple words what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well. 

However as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, simply after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.
18/12/23, 3:08 pm - +263 77 895 6269: Ohhhhhh interesting
18/12/23, 3:10 pm - Kunal: Indeed
Let me help you understand more on *Earn While You Learn Program*

The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
18/12/23, 3:10 pm - Kunal: Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.


The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
18/12/23, 3:10 pm - Kunal: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
18/12/23, 3:10 pm - Kunal: *Projects with Brands and Companies: -*
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:
Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
18/12/23, 3:10 pm - Kunal: *Recruitment Partners: -*
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-

18/12/23, 3:10 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
18/12/23, 3:10 pm - Kunal: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.


These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases.
18/12/23, 3:10 pm - Kunal: What are your views on the same? Do you think this will be benefiting from the Earn WHile You Learn Program?
18/12/23, 3:16 pm - +263 77 895 6269: Yes
18/12/23, 3:17 pm - Kunal: Indeed
If I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly*.
18/12/23, 3:22 pm - +263 77 895 6269: Wow
18/12/23, 3:22 pm - Kunal: Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counseling : 

 1. *Expert Career Counseling*: We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counselors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.
18/12/23, 3:22 pm - Kunal: 2. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off
18/12/23, 3:22 pm - Kunal: 3. *Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What's more, students earn
18/12/23, 3:22 pm - Kunal: *4.*Higher Education Concierge*: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships.

Stay Blessed!
18/12/23, 8:59 pm - +263 77 895 6269: Okay thank you
19/12/23, 9:40 am - Kunal: Good morning, everyone
How are you doing?
19/12/23, 9:44 am - +263 77 895 6269: Good morning, we are doing good
19/12/23, 9:46 am - Kunal: Good to hear that
19/12/23, 9:46 am - Kunal: Please address this
19/12/23, 9:56 am - +263 77 895 6269: I think my grandmother will address this
19/12/23, 10:04 am - Kunal: May I know when she will be available?
19/12/23, 10:27 am - +263 77 895 6269: She'll be here shortly
19/12/23, 10:31 am - Kunal: That's completely understandable,
So, I believe you'll be discussing everything with them after we complete today's session. Also after our counseling session I would connect to some of our Beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know the proceedings well.

So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
19/12/23, 11:18 am - +263 77 895 6269: Okay
19/12/23, 11:19 am - +263 77 895 6269: They are looking forward to it
19/12/23, 11:20 am - Kunal: I am glad to hear that, as studying Internationally would make your career advance at even a greater pace, as you will be transformed to a professional with a Greater Paying Job, which would actually help you in uplifting your family thereby yourself, and provide a peaceful and hassle free life to your parents.
19/12/23, 11:20 am - Kunal: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be 

1) Application Form 

2) Statement of Purpose which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

3) Letter of Recommendation from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university
19/12/23, 11:25 am - +263 77 895 6269: Even personal documents like passport, visa etc
19/12/23, 11:27 am - Kunal: Indeed
*When a student applies alone for an international University* , on an average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose of the students costs higher between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it.

Now this basically means, for a student to apply to just 5 Universities the average cost incurred by him/her would be somewhere between $1350-1750 (Application Form + Statement of Purpose). *without even recieving a guarantee to be selected on not
19/12/23, 11:27 am - Kunal: And do you know this is one reason which Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurity of what would happen, and just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.

So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create the statement of purpose but also helps you with the Visa Documentation Assistance,University Selection and sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc All these facilities would cost you more than $1350-$1750 without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only $750. This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
19/12/23, 11:27 am - Kunal: <Media omitted>
19/12/23, 11:31 am - +263 77 895 6269: Understood
19/12/23, 11:37 am - Kunal: Basically, there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

Phase 3: Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.
19/12/23, 11:37 am - Kunal: This enrollment fee includes your

-Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team
-Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities
-Earn While You Learn Program and training
-University sessions and interactions
-A guaranteed scholarship seat 
-Visa Documentation Assistance 
The Foster and Care throughout your course
19/12/23, 11:37 am - Kunal: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is *found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
19/12/23, 11:46 am - +263 77 895 6269: Okay.... <This message was edited>

I'm not sure if we have reached 2
19/12/23, 12:06 pm - Kunal: Well,
We are at stage one but we have also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.

In Step 1: Connect with a counsellor- As your counsellor, now we are going through the counselling process, discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

In Step 2:Eligibility Check- The eligibility check includes the interviews with Academic Board and Test.

Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa- If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program- This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.

We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
19/12/23, 12:16 pm - Kunal: Shall I explain further?
19/12/23, 12:24 pm - +263 77 895 6269: Yes please
19/12/23, 12:26 pm - Kunal: Step 5: After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors , they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by making a payment of the registration fee within a few weeks.
19/12/23, 12:26 pm - Kunal: This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself and after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).
19/12/23, 12:26 pm - Kunal: Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment,you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.

I hope you are clear with the process.
19/12/23, 12:29 pm - +263 77 895 6269: yessir
19/12/23, 1:19 pm - Kunal: Alright, we have come to the end of your counseling session, now before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
I want you to have a full-fledged discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family -

We're fine thanks and you

26/12/23, 2:48 pm - Austin: The refund policy states that the enrollment fee will be refunded if Edoofa fails to provide you an offer letter from University
26/12/23, 3:55 pm - +263 77 895 6269: ohhhhh okay

I once read that if results are out and one did not perform well, they are refunded their registration fee......or i did not understand that well?
26/12/23, 3:56 pm - +263 77 895 6269: ....And my apologies, my network is so down today, i think it's because of the weather this side
26/12/23, 4:00 pm - Austin: Let me help you with the same, as per your understanding, what is the minimum academic requirement for the Edoofa Scholarship Program?
26/12/23, 4:05 pm - +263 77 895 6269: At least 2 A level passes
26/12/23, 4:13 pm - Austin: That is right, Even though the minimum requirement is two A level passes,I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase the chances for higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it
26/12/23, 4:13 pm - Austin: Even if Edoofians fail to meet the requirements, they have a positive path ahead. If a student qualifies as a deserving student for the Edoofa scholarship we believe that he/she has the calibre to meet the grades, so in case they fail to meet them, even then the eligibility will be valid, and students can write the exams again, gain minimum points and can join the intake. With the right needs and resources students will give their best to perform well.

27/12/23, 4:01 pm - Austin: The cost of education through the Edoofa Scholarship Program will be reduced to $2000-$3000 per annum. The exact cost of education will be mentioned on the Offer Letters from Universities that Prosper will receive during the University sessions depending on the Scholarship percentage and University. For example, if education costs $2300 per annum, the first half would be $1150 and the remaining in January 2025.

Now, a part of this $1150 is to be paid as the registration fees after receiving the Offer Letter, dividing the total into multiple instalments and reducing the financial pressure.
27/12/23, 4:02 pm - Austin: Noted, do you wish to receive the invoice for the first part of the enrollment fee($200) today?
27/12/23, 4:04 pm - +263 71 280 4603: Not really but I will be able to pay after the 30th December

27/12/23, 4:11 pm - Austin: As you know higher education is a big decision that has to be taken through discussions with both students and families. 

So shall I schedule a video call for you with the Program Director at Edoofa to discuss your child's application, performance, and further procedures?
27/12/23, 4:13 pm - +263 71 280 4603: Yes you can but that will have to be tomorrow
27/12/23, 4:13 pm - Austin: Yes, shall I schedule at 8:00 am CAT tomorrow?
