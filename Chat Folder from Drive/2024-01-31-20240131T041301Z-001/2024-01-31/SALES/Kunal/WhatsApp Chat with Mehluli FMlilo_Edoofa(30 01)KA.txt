*I am Mr. Kunal, a Career Counselor at Edoofa, and with us, we have Mr. Jyotishman, the Head of Admissions, and Mr. Piyush, The Head of Counselling at Edoofa*


We have received an application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program for Mehluli FMlilo. 

I hope I have contacted the right person?
30/01/24, 3:20 pm - Kunal: As we were flooded with applications today and we didn't want to rush your application, so I have managed to reserve a time slot *tomorrow morning at 9:30 AM CAT*, I would appreciate it if you stay active and connected at the given time for a 2-hour counseling session so that we can process your application

I am leaving you with a video to go through it properly.
