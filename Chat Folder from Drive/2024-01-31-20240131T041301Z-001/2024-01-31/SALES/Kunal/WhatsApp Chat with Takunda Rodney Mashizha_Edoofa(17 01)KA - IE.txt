17/01/24, 10:49 am - +263 77 630 7092: I am will to have my child to go to India and study because I strongly feel he will get the best from Indian universities. Takunda is very much capable in mathematics as seen in his O level results where he had an A star with a mark of 92%. This also translate to being a science student hence his love for Aeronautics oriented courses. So taking him to India will be the best for his wishes and a scholarship in the likes of Edoofa will make his stay in India comfortable and conducive for him to come up with flying colours.
17/01/24, 10:55 am - +263 77 630 7092: Am currently residing in Manicaland Province in the Eastern part of Zim
17/01/24, 10:56 am - Kunal: Thank you for sharing your aspirations for your son, Takunda. It's wonderful to hear about his remarkable achievements, particularly his outstanding performance in mathematics with an A star and a mark of 92% in his O-level results.

So, may I know if he is currently in upper 6?
17/01/24, 10:57 am - +263 77 630 7092: Yes he is in Upper 6 doing Mathematics,  Physics and Chemistry

17/01/24, 12:54 pm - Kunal: Thank you for sharing
Let me brief you that, I want to brief you that the criteria before the pandemic was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is *a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about Takunda achieving it.
17/01/24, 12:55 pm - +263 77 630 7092: Am very much confident the he can achieve higher than the cut off point
17/01/24, 12:58 pm - Kunal: Good to hear that
17/01/24, 12:58 pm - Kunal: This message was deleted
17/01/24, 12:59 pm - Kunal: I hope you are aware that studying abroad involves a financial aspect. May I know who will support Takunda financially with his education abroad?
17/01/24, 12:59 pm - +263 77 630 7092: Myself as the parent I will support him
17/01/24, 1:02 pm - Kunal: Well noted
17/01/24, 1:03 pm - Kunal: Looking at Takunda's interests and passion for Aeronautics, let me share with you that we do offer *Aerospace Engineering* but as your counselor I would like to highlight a few parameters

-This is a niche course that has a higher cost of education compared to other branches of engineering and the quantum of scholarship offered is low

- If Takunda opts for this branch, his scope of career opportunities will be confined to the branch of Aerospace/Aeronautical itself. At the same time if he opts for a degree like *Mechanical Engineering*, it can help to bridge to Aeronautical, Aerospace, Automotive, etc at the same time helps to fulfill your interests in solving challenges, bringing innovations and at the same time offering a wider spectrum of career opportunities as Mechanical Engineering is known as the mother of Engineering!
17/01/24, 1:03 pm - Kunal: So, shall I explain *Bachelor of Technology in Mechanical Engineering*?
17/01/24, 1:04 pm - +263 77 630 7092: Yes please go on and explain
17/01/24, 1:05 pm - Kunal: *B.Tech. Mechanical Engineering* is a 4-year undergraduate course

First thing any engineering aspirant considers while choosing a branch in Engineering is placement aspect and the course very well caters to it. A few questions which arise when admissions to engineering colleges commence include the branch in demand, highest paid engineering graduates and others such.  Apart from this palcement criteria, there are some other parameters which should be considered while choosing a discipline like- what are the research opportunities, what is scope of career growth etc.

Mechanical Engineering is the evergreen branch of engineering. Market scenario and demand of engineering graduates change every year but the demand of mechanical engineering degree will never be obsolete. Mechanical engineering graduates can find placements in almost every sector, right from construction sector to steel industry and from automobile to software.

Following are the sub disciplines that are associated with mechanical engineering:

*Production Engineering*
*Industrial Engineering*
*Manufacturing Engineering*
*Automobile Engineering*
*Artificial Intelligence*

The field of mechanical engineering can be thought of as a collection of many mechanical engineering science disciplines. Several of these subdisciplines which are typically taught at the undergraduate level are listed below, with a brief explanation and the most common application of each. Some of these subdisciplines are unique to mechanical engineering, while others are a combination of mechanical engineering and one or more other disciplines. Most work that a mechanical engineer does uses skills and techniques from several of these subdisciplines, as well as specialized subdisciplines. Specialized subdisciplines, as used in this article, are more likely to be the subject of graduate studies or on-the-job training than undergraduate research. Several specialized sub disciplines are discussed in this section.

*Mechanics* 

Mechanics is, in the most general sense, the study of forces and their effect upon matter. Typically, engineering mechanics is used to analyze and predict the acceleration and deformation (both elastic and plastic) of objects under known forces (also called loads) or stresses. Subdisciplines of mechanics include Statics, the study of non-moving bodies under known loads, how forces affect static bodies Dynamics the study of how forces affect moving bodies. Dynamics includes kinematics (about movement, velocity, and acceleration) and kinetics (about forces and resulting accelerations). Mechanics of materials, the study of how different materials deform under various types of stress Fluid mechanics, the study of how fluids react to forces Kinematics, the study of the motion of bodies (objects) and systems (groups of objects), while ignoring the forces that cause the motion. Kinematics is often used in the design and analysis of mechanisms. Continuum mechanics, a method of applying mechanics that assumes that objects are continuous (rather than discrete) Mechanical engineers typically use mechanics in the design or analysis phases of engineering. If the engineering project were the design of a vehicle, statics might be employed to design the frame of the vehicle, in order to evaluate where the stresses will be most intense. Dynamics might be used when designing the car's engine, to evaluate the forces in the pistons and cams as the engine cycles. Mechanics of materials might be used to choose appropriate materials for the frame and engine. Fluid mechanics might be used to design a ventilation system for the vehicle (see HVAC), or to design the intake system for the engine

*Mechatronics and Robotics*

Mechatronics is a combination of mechanics and electronics. It is an interdisciplinary branch of mechanical engineering, electrical engineering and software engineering that is concerned with integrating electrical and mechanical engineering to create hybrid systems. In this way, machines can be automated through the use of electric motors, servo-mechanisms, and other electrical systems in conjunction with special software. A common example of a mechatronics system is a CD-ROM drive. Mechanical systems open and close the drive, spin the CD and move the laser, while an optical system reads the data on the CD and converts it to bits. Integrated software controls the process and communicates the contents of the CD to the computer.

Robotics is the application of mechatronics to create robots, which are often used in industry to perform tasks that are dangerous, unpleasant, or repetitive. These robots may be of any shape and size, but all are preprogrammed and interact physically with the world. To create a robot, an engineer typically employs kinematics (to determine the robot's range of motion) and mechanics (to determine the stresses within the robot).

Robots are used extensively in industrial engineering. They allow businesses to save money on labor, perform tasks that are either too dangerous or too precise for humans to perform them economically, and to ensure better quality. Many companies employ assembly lines of robots, especially in Automotive Industries and some factories are so robotized that they can run by themselves. Outside the factory, robots have been employed in bomb disposal, space exploration, and many other fields. Robots are also sold for various residential applications, from recreation to domestic applications.

*Thermodynamics and Thermo-science*

Thermodynamics is an applied science used in several branches of engineering, including mechanical and chemical engineering. At its simplest, thermodynamics is the study of energy, its use and transformation through a system. Typically, engineering thermodynamics is concerned with changing energy from one form to another. As an example, automotive engines convert chemical energy (enthalpy) from the fuel into heat, and then into mechanical work that eventually turns the wheels.

Thermodynamics principles are used by mechanical engineers in the fields of heat transfer, thermofluids, and energy conversion. Mechanical engineers use thermo-science to design engines and power plants, heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems, heat exchangers, heat sinks, radiators, refrigeration, insulation, and others.

*Design and drafting*

Drafting or technical drawing is the means by which mechanical engineers design products and create instructions for manufacturing parts. A technical drawing can be a computer model or hand-drawn schematic showing all the dimensions necessary to manufacture a part, as well as assembly notes, a list of required materials, and other pertinent information. A U.S. mechanical engineer or skilled worker who creates technical drawings may be referred to as a drafter or draftsman. Drafting has historically been a two-dimensional process, but computer-aided design (CAD) programs now allow the designer to create in three dimensions.

Instructions for manufacturing a part must be fed to the necessary machinery, either manually, through programmed instructions, or through the use of a computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) or combined CAD/CAM program. Optionally, an engineer may also manually manufacture a part using the technical drawings. However, with the advent of computer numerically controlled (CNC) manufacturing, parts can now be fabricated without the need for constant technician input. Manually manufactured parts generally consist of spray coatings, surface finishes, and other processes that cannot economically or practically be done by a machine.

Drafting is used in nearly every subdiscipline of mechanical engineering, and by many other branches of engineering and architecture. Three-dimensional models created using CAD software are also commonly used in finite element analysis (FEA) and computational fluid dynamics (CFD).
17/01/24, 1:16 pm - +263 77 630 7092: Thank you for a detailed account of what mechanical engineering is all about. So I will encou him to do mechanical engineering for a start then he can always do his choice as a post graduate program. Also ad you said that it a bit expensive it is good to do what will be achievable financially and of course nearer to what he actually wants. So let's consider of Mechanical Engineering.
17/01/24, 1:19 pm - Kunal: Good to hear that
As we've thoroughly covered the course details, and since you are aware Edoofa Recommends India as a Higher Education Platform

17/01/24, 1:44 pm - Kunal: Well, I am sure after seeing all these amazing facts, you are intrigued about your child to study in India. So can you now tell me, How would studying in India implement a positive impact on your child's career?
17/01/24, 1:47 pm - +263 77 630 7092: Studying in India will widen his opportunities globally since universities in India are highly equipped and highly ranked in the academic circles.
17/01/24, 1:50 pm - +263 77 630 7092: Also industry he can easily fit in any nation with qualifications and skills from Indian universities
17/01/24, 1:53 pm - Kunal: Indeed, I believe your child would learn a lot from the exposures offered if found eligible and works hard to achieve the dreams. Moving ahead, by any chance are you familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?
17/01/24, 1:55 pm - +263 77 630 7092: I am not really conversant with that
17/01/24, 1:55 pm - Kunal: Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth! 

In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc,it is still beyond the reach of many.
With the Edoofa Scholarship Program,the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library,Wifi,Laundry,etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
17/01/24, 1:55 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
17/01/24, 1:55 pm - Kunal: In simple words what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost $3000 or less a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well. 

However, as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even after this we allow the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.

*So do you feel the reduced cost of education is affordable to your family?*
17/01/24, 1:58 pm - +263 77 630 7092: I strongly feel I can afford that
17/01/24, 1:58 pm - Kunal: Good to hear that
Let me tell you how Edoofa helps Edoofians bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the *Earn While You Learn Program*

The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that are equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable. The Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies and needs, converting an Individual into a market-ready professional. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
17/01/24, 1:58 pm - Kunal: *Projects with Brands and Companies: -*
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, such as:
*Africa Global Radio-* The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project and hear from the CEO about the exposures of the Edoofa program.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0
*Skooqs-* This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

*Recruitment Partners:-*
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

*Webinars:-*
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars regularly with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
-Digitalization of Industries: How to Become an all-rounder in the Ever-changing Professional World by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
-How to Network like a Boss by Ms Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi
-How to be industry-ready before graduating? Hear it from an Employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu
-It’s Never Too Late to Pursue Your Passion: My Journey from Real Estate to Entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje
-Decoding the Science of Personal Branding by Mr, Simon Maingi
17/01/24, 1:59 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
17/01/24, 2:07 pm - +263 77 630 7092: In Zimbabwe we used to call it education with production. I think it's beneficial to the student academically since you will be doing something linked to your study and also benefit the student financilly
17/01/24, 2:07 pm - +263 77 630 7092: I salute such an innovation
17/01/24, 2:10 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
17/01/24, 2:10 pm - Kunal: Indeed,
If I have to help you explain how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable compared to Local Universities, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now, if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, bringing the cost further down to $1000 per year including the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month. _This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly._

*You can see this even in this scholarship credit certificate where one of our star performers, our Proud Edoodians  Masinire Miriam earned $1965 within a year.* I hope you can now realize the power of the EWYL program to reduce the financial pressure on families?
17/01/24, 2:13 pm - +263 77 630 7092: It is quite helpful in reducing financial pressure and Takunda is such a young man who is hard working. I think he can match the standards
17/01/24, 2:17 pm - Kunal: Great, Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, a few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :

*1. Expert Career Counselling:* We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counsellors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.

*2. Affordability through guaranteed scholarships:* Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off.

*3. Earn While You Learn:* The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing our students for the real world. 

*4.Higher Education Concierge:* A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.*

After going through these facts that make Edoofa different, which one out of the 4 did you feel is the most significant?
17/01/24, 2:22 pm - +263 77 630 7092: Though all aspects a important, the First is important because without proper choices even if resources are available they will wasted for nothing.  So the right information will help all the other aspects to come to shape and fruition
17/01/24, 2:28 pm - Kunal: Great! 
So now I know you focus more on quality education and guidance.
Let me also show you some monthly earnings of students through Earn While You Learn.

17/01/24, 2:28 pm - Kunal: There is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it  depends upon his/her hard work.
However may I know, who will be helping Takunda with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
17/01/24, 2:31 pm - +263 77 630 7092: I will be helping him with the remaining fees
17/01/24, 2:31 pm - Kunal: That is completely understandable
So how do you feel about your child studying abroad?
17/01/24, 2:33 pm - +263 77 630 7092: Am very much interested in my child studying abroad especially after the insight I got from Adoofa. Looking positively for him to go abroad
17/01/24, 2:34 pm - Kunal: I am glad to hear that, studying Internationally would make your child’s career advance at an even greater pace, as your child will be transformed into a professional with a Greater Paying Job, which would help in uplifting your family and provide a hassle-free life.
17/01/24, 2:34 pm - Kunal: *As we move to the last part of the session, let me highlight a few requirements while a student applies alone* 

*1) Application Form* -An online or offline form that asks for your personal details and academic background.

*2) Statement of Purpose-* An essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and your aspirations for your career.

*3) Letter of Recommendation-* from Senior authorities, School Heads or others on why they recommend you to be a right fit for an international university.
Do you know about other requirements?
17/01/24, 2:38 pm - +263 77 630 7092: Am not sure maybe you can shade light on that and also when are these due. Also let me ask. Is the application form different from the on Takunda did send in January
17/01/24, 2:39 pm - Kunal: Absolutely, When a student applies alone for an international University, on average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose costs between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally and act as a major parameter to decide the child’s eligibility. If you apply to 5 Universities, the average costs for the mentioned would be $1350-$1750, *without even receiving a guarantee to be selected*

*Edoofa has identified a solution for this uncertainty and unaffordability.* If a student qualifies after the eligibility check, not only does Edoofa help them draft their statement of purpose but also helps in terms of Visa Documentation Assistance, University Session and selection, Individual mentorship, etc, reducing the costs significantly to $750 which is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
17/01/24, 2:40 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
17/01/24, 2:43 pm - +263 77 630 7092: Yes please
17/01/24, 2:44 pm - Kunal: There are 3 phases to the enrollment process.
 
*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation
If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Acceptance Letter. You are supposed to pay the enrollment fee of $350 in 7 days for the scholarship seat reservation and to begin the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2*: Once the students complete Phase 1 they will be starting the Earn While You Learn program session(Each student will have an opportunity to earn scholarship credits that can be used to reduce their fee even before their A-Level result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final A-level results are out and the student has passed the requirement as per Edoofa, then their final university evaluation and Admission will continue. However, if the student wouldn’t meet the requirements as per the university and Edoofa, then the $350 will be refunded to the parent.

The amount of credits earned by the student in phase 2 can be used for the first year’s annual fee itself so that parents are relieved from financial stress paving the way for proper financial planning for higher education.
17/01/24, 2:44 pm - Kunal: The enrollment fee is to be paid only if a child is found eligible for the Edoofa Scholarship Program after passing the eligibility check stage, it includes, 

*Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
*Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
*Earn While You Learn Program and training*
*University sessions and selection*
*A guaranteed scholarship seat*
*Visa Documentation Assistance*
*The Foster and Care throughout the course of an Edoofian*
17/01/24, 2:44 pm - Kunal: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge due to which parents might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short period of 7 days and for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option wherein if the student is found eligible, instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, *parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days thereby reducing the financial pressure.*
17/01/24, 2:51 pm - +263 77 630 7092: Thank you. When will his eligibility be cornfimed so that I plan for the fees. Also take note that mhe will be writing in October- November and can only go to university in 2025.
17/01/24, 2:58 pm - Kunal: Yes, I am aware of his intake, Mr Samuel
Let me tell you that after completing this session we will be having an eligibility check process in the next stage in which if his application is found eligible for the program, you will receive an acceptance letter from the Board
17/01/24, 2:58 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
17/01/24, 3:02 pm - +263 77 630 7092: I think we are on stage 1
17/01/24, 3:03 pm - Kunal: Well,
We are at stage one but we have also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.

In Step 1: Connect with a counsellor- As your counsellor, now we are going through the counselling process, discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

In Step 2:Eligibility Check- The eligibility check includes the interviews with Academic Board and Test.

Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa- If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program- This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.

We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
17/01/24, 3:04 pm - +263 77 630 7092: Yes explain it to me
17/01/24, 3:12 pm - Kunal: *Step 5:* After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities. 

August 2025 intake applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 instalments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.
17/01/24, 3:13 pm - Kunal: Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment,you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.

I hope you are clear with the process.
17/01/24, 3:15 pm - +263 77 630 7092: It's clear thank you
17/01/24, 3:16 pm - Kunal: Alright Mr Samuel
We have come to the end of your counselling session. Before I guide you Step 2 of the Eligibility Check, I want you to have a full-fledged discussion of the Edoofa program within your family as higher education is supposed to be a family decision. Ensure to include these aspects during the discussions:-

*About the EDOOFA Program and its vision of making Education Affordable and Edoofians Employment Ready.*
*Value of the career of an Edoofian after pursuing higher education in India.*
*The financial aspects and how Edoofa brings in affordability and self-financing opportunities for students.*
17/01/24, 3:16 pm - Kunal: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences,

19/01/24, 10:38 am - +263 77 630 7092: Morning Sir. Yes I did
19/01/24, 10:48 am - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: Okay so now @263776307092 I would like to ask you a few questions, are you ready please?
19/01/24, 10:57 am - +263 77 630 7092: Yes I am
19/01/24, 10:57 am - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: Let me put up my question please!
19/01/24, 10:58 am - +263 77 630 7092: Ok please
19/01/24, 11:12 am - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: <Media omitted>
19/01/24, 11:12 am - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: @263776307092 please answer the question in a voicenote!
19/01/24, 11:20 am - +263 77 630 7092: <Media omitted>
19/01/24, 11:23 am - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: @263776307092 I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
19/01/24, 11:31 am - +263 77 630 7092: Yes I really understand the situation we are in. As a teacher my priority is to see my children doing well at a good university. There all my resources I make sure they take care of my children and fortunately am left with one child in high school who happens to be Takunda. The first born has completed university and now looking for a job. Iam very much certain that with my salary of 735 US dollars per month I will afford to look after him abroad. Also my wife is a nurse Aid who can afford to put food on the table for the family.
19/01/24, 11:34 am - +263 77 630 7092: Also having worked in South Africa I managed to buy a property that I am renting out part of it. So I will be able to take care of him bearing in mind that if successful Takunda will have a scholarship from Edoofa.

24/01/24, 4:18 pm - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: Good Afternoon @263776307092 I had a chance to discuss the application with the Board once again. As per the acting policies and standards the Academic Board is not viable to change the 7 day deadline period. However, after careful consideration, they are willing to consider that since Takunda's deadline is of 26th, and you are not prepared with $200 as of now, in that case, you can complete a part of the fee equivalent of $100, by the deadline so that the remaining $100 could be completed in the next 7 days. This would not only help you with reserving the seat but at the same time it would give you time to be prepared for the rest $100 as well!

I feel this is convenient to you and your family now?
26/01/24, 4:21 pm - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: Good Day Mr Samuel
26/01/24, 4:22 pm - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: I have been expecting to hear from you since Wednesday?
30/01/24, 4:16 pm - Kunal: Good Day 
We have been looking forward to hearing from you but it seems like you aren't serious about this opportunity.

Despite the passing of the due date, we still kept the application on hold so that you can complete the enrollment as you informed and were expecting to hear from you on the same. Tomorrow would be the final day to consider the application of Takunda for the Edoofa Scholarship Program <This message was edited>
30/01/24, 4:16 pm - Kunal: We are currently experiencing a huge rush of applicants and we need to revoke the previous applications to offer more slots to the aspirants in waiting
30/01/24, 4:16 pm - Kunal: Let me know if you have any questions for me
