24/01/24, 9:31 am - Kunal: Good morning, Trevor
How are you doing?
24/01/24, 9:36 am - +263 77 763 6776: I’m doing alright, thanks for asking.
How about you
24/01/24, 9:42 am - Kunal: I am doing fine, thank you
24/01/24, 9:42 am - Kunal: Please respond to this and let us continue
24/01/24, 9:44 am - +263 77 763 6776: Alright, please forgive me for the delay, I was still composing my response
24/01/24, 9:45 am - +263 77 763 6776: Thank you for the opportunity and I’m pleased to get to tell you about myself.

I’m a 25 year old male bachelor of accounting university graduate hoping to further my studies in the field of accounting. 

I have had some work experience at a media house in Zimbabwe in the accounting department.

I’m interested in physical exercise which I engage in on a daily basis at dawn. It has helped me cope with a lot over the years and not only because of the direct impact it has had in making me feel fit but also in the community of fellow runners and fitness enthusiasts like me that I encounter when I go out. 

I have found that my strength is in willingness to learn and evolve as a person which manifests in a constant desire to develop my skills to be able to complete my goals and to help those who may need assistance in developing said skills as well. 

However, my weakness could be the pursuit of perfection in my work. As far as i can trace I believe it comes from studying and practicing accounting where there is an expectation of some degree of perfection in working on financial books. It would seem that the desire and expectation in myself to be perfect also affects me when performing some duties and in learning new skills.

As for the family, we are Zimbabweans and I have always stayed with my two parents and my younger sister in Harare.

1. I am a university graduate.
2. ⁠I would like to further my accounting studies, doing a Masters in Accounting. 
3. ⁠My father is retired & my mother is a teacher.
4. ⁠Both my parents are degree holders, father has a bachelor of Commerce in accounting and mother has a bachelor of science in counseling 
5. ⁠I have a younger sister doing her A levels by the name of Amanda.
6. ⁠My aunt has been financially supporting my education.
7. ⁠My aunt will be financially supporting my higher education abroad.
8. ⁠I’m from Harare
9. ⁠O level school - Marist Brothers Nyanga High School ($400/term)
A level school - Mt Selinda High school Chirinda. ($400/term)

I hope this information about myself is up to your expectation and do tell me if you need more clarity on anything.
24/01/24, 9:56 am - Kunal: Thank you for sharing in detail, I am glad to hear and learn more about you. I am delighted that you expressed yourself genuinely.
24/01/24, 9:56 am - Kunal: I would like to share that Harare is very close to us as our founders hosted Education summits last year as well as this year. We are associated with many schools in Harare, some of them are the Nation's best schools, including *St. Dominic’s Chishawasha, Dominican Convent High, Christ Ministries, Mablereigh Girls High, St Ignatius, St John's, Harare High, Advent Hope Academy etc*

Is that fine?

How are you?
24/01/24, 11:39 am - Kunal: Thank you for sharing, Trevor
24/01/24, 11:40 am - Kunal: Based on my evaluation, considering your subjects, interests, and passion, you are eligible to pursue 
 
*Master of Commerce or M.Com.*

Do you want me to explain the course in depth?
24/01/24, 11:41 am - +263 77 763 6776: Yes, I’d appreciate if you explained it in depth
24/01/24, 11:41 am - Kunal: *Master of Commerce or M.Com.* is a 2-year post- graduate Master’s degree which focuses on Commerce, Accounting, Management and Economics related subjects. The course mainly includes thesis based components and there may be some research-based elements included.


An M.Com. graduate can look for a career opportunity in public sector in various nationalized banks like State Bank of India, Union Bank etc. or in private sector in roles like Assistant Manager, Company Law Assistant, Junior Accountant, Relationship Manager, Sales Officer (accounts).


Master of Commerce (M.Com): What is it about? 
Master of Commerce is one of the prestigious courses in the country. The program is well received in the industry and for years had been serving the needs of managerial cadre in business and industry. It is a notch higher than a Bachelor degree in Commerce and helps build an in-depth knowledge about various commerce and trade practices.

It is a specialized course which prepares an individual for a career in finance and corporate sector. The course is of 2 years duration in which each year is comprised of two semesters with various subjects based on thesis and research work according to the curriculum of university.

Ideally M.Com. course consists of core courses and electives. While core courses relate to fundamental concepts of commerce, electives are generally associated with specific knowledge and skills. Mostly all colleges offering M.Com. follow same structure. Methods of education include lectures, seminars, classroom study and discussion, individual and group projects, case studies, and internship.


Master of Commerce (M.Com): Career Prospects
M.Com is a post graduate course pursued after B.com which is an undergraduate course. After M.Com., students can opt for MBA or LLB, Doctor of Commerce (D.Com.), Doctor of Business Administration (DBA), or a Doctor of Philosophy (PhD). MBA is being offered by many Top Universities all over India including Indian Institute of Management (IIM) and Symbiosis Institute of Business Management, Pune (SIBM).

After completion of Master of Commerce program, a student can also find employment in both Private and Public Sector. An M.Com. degree holder can look for a career opportunity in public sector in various nationalized banks like State Bank of India, Union Bank etc. Railway Recruitment Board recruits these postgraduates for the post of Assistant Accounts/Audit Officer.

In Private Sector too, they can find employment in many roles such as:

*Accountant*
*Finance manager*
*Operation manager*
*Financial analyst*
*Assistant finance manager*
*Account executive*
24/01/24, 11:47 am - +263 77 763 6776: Thank you for that in-depth explanation. I would be interested in taking it up
24/01/24, 11:48 am - Kunal: Good to hear that!
As we've thoroughly covered the course details can you tell me how you see yourself in 5 years after your course and If you are provided with this career option and how can being an Edoofian enable you to achieve your career goals?
24/01/24, 12:09 pm - +263 77 763 6776: The idea is to get the information when I can, that is through learning, then acquire the experience of formal working environments, that is through work, and finally evaluate where I stand on the job market whether I am satisfied with my value or if I would need to acquire more knowledge or experience.

5 years from now I will be 30 years of age. I want to be able to lead ground breaking work in my country of origin, introducing it to innovations I would have picked up abroad that have not been capitalized at home. If by that time I am not ready for that journey yet, I want to be able to be in a position where I’m employable abroad to get more experience of how other parts of the world conduct work and benefit from understanding their cultures.
24/01/24, 12:30 pm - Kunal: Please excuse me for some time as I am heading for my lunch. Let us connect at 2:00 pm CAT for the next part of our session. Let me know if you have any challenges with the schedule. 

Meanwhile, you can go through our Social Media pages to learn more about the experiences of Edoofians and the program!

24/01/24, 2:19 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
24/01/24, 2:19 pm - Kunal: Well, I am sure after seeing all these amazing facts, you are intrigued to study in India. So can you now tell me, How would studying in India implement a positive impact on your career and How do you aim to achieve your career aspirations from studying in India?
24/01/24, 3:50 pm - +263 77 763 6776: I’m definitely overwhelmed by how much on an impact the Indian education system has had on all these successful people. It gives me hope that I also have a chance to be successful through the same path. It’s a motivation booster and will help me stay focused.

I believe studying in India will help me connect with people from diverse back grounds and connect me with their ideas and views of life. Something I’ll definitely need if ever I’m to make an impact like all these other successful individuals coming out of the Indian education system. 

Will be looking forward to interacting with all these facts first hand
24/01/24, 3:52 pm - Kunal: Amazing!
As I can see, you have understood the quality of higher education  which Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead.

By any chance are you familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship?
24/01/24, 3:57 pm - +263 77 763 6776: I am familiar with the cost of getting a college education from a few other countries but not from India.
24/01/24, 4:11 pm - Kunal: Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth! 

In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc,it is still beyond the reach of many.
With the Edoofa Scholarship Program,the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library,Wifi,Laundry,etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
24/01/24, 4:12 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
24/01/24, 4:23 pm - +263 77 763 6776: Looking at the remaining cost i don’t think it will be affordable to my family
24/01/24, 4:26 pm - Kunal: I understand
So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians.Looking at this cost of education also, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits and which can help you in reducing their fees further.
And do you know how that is done?
24/01/24, 4:39 pm - +263 77 763 6776: Thank you for this information. 
No I do not know how this is done.
May you please elaborate further
24/01/24, 4:40 pm - Kunal: Let me tell you how Edoofa helps Edoofians bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the *Earn While You Learn Program*

The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that are equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable. The Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies and needs, converting an Individual into a market-ready professional. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
24/01/24, 4:40 pm - Kunal: *Projects with Brands and Companies: -*
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, such as:
*Africa Global Radio-* The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project and hear from the CEO about the exposures of the Edoofa program.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0
*Skooqs-* This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

*Recruitment Partners:-*
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

*Webinars:-*
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars regularly with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
-Digitalization of Industries: How to Become an all-rounder in the Ever-changing Professional World by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
-How to Network like a Boss by Ms Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi
-How to be industry-ready before graduating? Hear it from an Employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu
-It’s Never Too Late to Pursue Your Passion: My Journey from Real Estate to Entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje
-Decoding the Science of Personal Branding by Mr, Simon Maingi
24/01/24, 4:41 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
24/01/24, 4:46 pm - +263 77 763 6776: I believe I could indeed benefit from the Earn While you learn program and can’t wait to view the links and learn more about the programs tonight.
24/01/24, 4:58 pm - Kunal: Indeed,
If I have to help you explain how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable compared to Local Universities, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now, if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, bringing the cost further down to $1000 per year including the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month. _This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly._

*You can see this even in this scholarship credit certificate where one of our star performers, our Proud Edoodians  Masinire Miriam earned $1965 within a year.* I hope you can now realize the power of the EWYL program to reduce the financial pressure on families?
24/01/24, 4:58 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
24/01/24, 5:01 pm - +263 77 763 6776: Thank you, that makes it really clear the potential of I could realize from the Earn While You Learn
24/01/24, 5:01 pm - Kunal: Great, Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, a few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :

*1. Expert Career Counselling:* We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counsellors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.

*2. Affordability through guaranteed scholarships:* Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off.

*3. Earn While You Learn:* The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing our students for the real world. 

*4.Higher Education Concierge:* A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.*

After going through these facts that make Edoofa different, which one out of the 4 did you feel is the most significant?
24/01/24, 5:11 pm - +263 77 763 6776: All of them sound really significant to me. However the earn while you learn program gives the student the opportunity to get a feel of the working environment and confidence to go out in the world and apply what they are learning in the practical world with an added advantage of lessening the financial burdens on their education journey
24/01/24, 5:15 pm - Kunal: Great! 
So now I know you focus more on affordability and employability.
Let me also show you some monthly earnings of students through Earn While You Learn.

24/01/24, 5:16 pm - Kunal: There is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it  depends upon his/her hard work.
However may I know, who will be helping you with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
24/01/24, 5:18 pm - +263 77 763 6776: My aunt, the one I added to the group, will be helping me out
24/01/24, 5:22 pm - Kunal: That's completely understandable,
So, I believe you'll be discussing everything with them after we complete today's session. Also after our counseling session I would connect to some of our Beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know the proceedings well.

So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
24/01/24, 5:24 pm - +263 77 763 6776: Yes I will be talking to my aunt and everyone in my family about this step by step.

Everyone is delighted that I’m being considered for this program
24/01/24, 5:27 pm - Kunal: I am glad to hear that, as studying Internationally would make your career advance at even a greater pace, as you will be transformed to a professional with a Greater Paying Job, which would actually help you in uplifting your family thereby yourself, and provide a peaceful and hassle free life to your parents.
24/01/24, 5:27 pm - Kunal: *As we move to the last part of the session, let me highlight a few requirements while a student applies alone* 

*1) Application Form* -An online or offline form that asks for your personal details and academic background.

*2) Statement of Purpose-* An essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and your aspirations for your career.

*3) Letter of Recommendation-* from Senior authorities, School Heads or others on why they recommend you to be a right fit for an international university.
Do you know about other requirements?
24/01/24, 5:35 pm - +263 77 763 6776: No, please enlighten me on other requirements as well
24/01/24, 5:40 pm - Kunal: Absolutely, When a student applies alone for an international University, on average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose costs between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally and act as a major parameter to decide the child’s eligibility. If you apply to 5 Universities, the average costs for the mentioned would be $1350-$1750, *without even receiving a guarantee to be selected*

*Edoofa has identified a solution for this uncertainty and unaffordability.* If a student qualifies after the eligibility check, not only does Edoofa help them draft their statement of purpose but also helps in terms of Visa Documentation Assistance, University Session and selection, Individual mentorship, etc, reducing the costs significantly to $750 which is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
24/01/24, 5:40 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
24/01/24, 6:11 pm - +263 77 763 6776: Yes please do inform me
24/01/24, 6:12 pm - Kunal: The enrollment fee is to be paid only if a child is found eligible for the Edoofa Scholarship Program after passing the eligibility check stage, it includes, 

*Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
*Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
*Earn While You Learn Program and training*
*University sessions and selection*
*A guaranteed scholarship seat*
*Visa Documentation Assistance*
*The Foster and Care throughout the course of an Edoofian*
24/01/24, 6:12 pm - Kunal: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge due to which parents might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short period of 7 days and for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option wherein if the student is found eligible, instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, *parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days thereby reducing the financial pressure.*
24/01/24, 6:16 pm - +263 77 763 6776: That sounds like a better and more affordable plan for payment of the fee
24/01/24, 6:17 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
24/01/24, 6:18 pm - +263 77 763 6776: We have done up to stage 2
24/01/24, 6:20 pm - Kunal: Well,
We are at stage one but we have also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.

In Step 1: Connect with a counsellor- As your counsellor, now we are going through the counselling process, discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

In Step 2:Eligibility Check- The eligibility check includes the interviews with Academic Board and Test.

Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa- If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program- This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.

We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
24/01/24, 6:23 pm - +263 77 763 6776: Yes, please explain so that I get the full picture.
24/01/24, 6:23 pm - Kunal: *Step 5:* After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors. They will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. will be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by paying the registration fee within a few weeks.

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education and the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).
24/01/24, 6:23 pm - Kunal: Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment,you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.

I hope you are clear with the process.
24/01/24, 6:26 pm - +263 77 763 6776: It is very clear, thank you.
24/01/24, 6:30 pm - Kunal: Alright Trevor
24/01/24, 6:30 pm - Kunal: We have come to the end of your counselling session. Before I guide you Step 2 of the Eligibility Check, I want you to have a full-fledged discussion of the Edoofa program within your family as higher education is supposed to be a family decision. Ensure to include these aspects during the discussions:-

*About the EDOOFA Program and its vision of making Education Affordable and Edoofians Employment Ready.*
*Value of the career of an Edoofian after pursuing higher education in India.*
*The financial aspects and how Edoofa brings in affordability and self-financing opportunities for students.*
24/01/24, 6:30 pm - Kunal: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences,

*Edoofa’s Website- www.edoofa.com* 
*Pictures (Edoofians from Africa studying in India): https://tinyurl.com/3ke35s35*

*Please ensure to go through the FAQ document before the next stage and refer the same to your family as it has answers to most of the queries.* Furthermore, if you have any other queries I would suggest that you note them down and we will discuss them in the next session.

Let me also share a few pictures of the students who are studying in India through the Edoofa Program so that you can witness the exposures and their experiences.

24/01/24, 7:37 pm - +263 77 763 6776: Thank you 🙏
25/01/24, 12:01 pm - Kunal: Greetings to you alll

Congratulations on clearing stage 1 of the Edoofa Program I hope you have learned about the program better through the previous sessions. Now, I will guide you to the most important *Eligibility check stage* after addressing your questions. 

Are you ready for the same?
25/01/24, 12:01 pm - +263 77 763 6776: Good day Mr Kunal
Yes I’m ready
25/01/24, 12:02 pm - Kunal: It is good to hear from you
Did you manage to discuss the Edoofa Program with your family, please?
25/01/24, 12:03 pm - +263 77 763 6776: Yes we had an extensive discussion about it after our session
25/01/24, 12:04 pm - Kunal: Good to know, can you provide a summary of your family discussions regarding the Edoofa Scholarship Program and share their thoughts after learning more about the program?
25/01/24, 12:25 pm - +263 77 763 6776: We discussed what it would mean for the family if I got the opportunity to go.

The main concern seemed  to be over financing part of the cost that won’t be covered by Edoofa with everyone encouraging me to be ready to work hard and in the earn as you learn program and stay focused.

There was also discussions centered on having me to always remember to focus on my main purpose if I manage to get in and respect others way of life due to cultural differences I’ll likely face.
25/01/24, 12:28 pm - Kunal: I understand, Trevor
May I know if your family has any queries, please
25/01/24, 12:33 pm - +263 77 763 6776: As it stands from yesterday’s family discussion, there are no queries
25/01/24, 12:35 pm - Kunal: That is fine, 

May I know the thoughts and opinions of your family regarding the financial aspects such as enrollment fees and cost of education, please <This message was edited>
25/01/24, 12:44 pm - +263 77 763 6776: There’s a great deal of concern on cost of education at the moment stemming from how much of it Edoofa will end up covering. But there hasn’t been much discussion on enrollment fees
25/01/24, 1:03 pm - Kunal: Trevor, I had already mentioned the cost of eduction after the reduction from the Edoofa scholarship program <This message was edited>
25/01/24, 1:05 pm - +263 77 763 6776: Yes, sorry. It was mostly just speculation of what percentage from 50% - 100% that I could get and what that would mean for the family in covering the rest
25/01/24, 1:06 pm - Kunal: Let me help you understand
The final percentage of the scholarship will be decided after the University Sessions of an Edoofian after his/her enrollment

The percentage of scholarships is determined by the following factors

1) Academic Excellence
2) Merit
3) Previous Experiences
4) Recommendations from Edoofa
5) Statement of Purpose(SOP) 
6) Extracurricular Activities

So the universities will evaluate them to decide the final quantum of the scholarship
25/01/24, 1:08 pm - +263 77 763 6776: Alright, thank you for clarifying that part. It is clear now
25/01/24, 1:08 pm - Kunal: Good to know that
Before we move to the Eligibility Procedures, can you tell me?

1. What is the name of the course that you would be studying through the Edoofa Program?

2. In which country will you be studying through the Edoofa program?

3. What is the average cost of studies in India without a scholarship?

4. What is the annual fee you will pay if found eligible for the program?

5. What is the enrollment fee of the Edoofa Program and in how many days is it paid if you are found eligible?

6. Please elaborate on your understanding of the Earn While You Learn program in 75-100 words.

7. After receiving your offer letter from the University, you will have to pay your registration fee to finalize your university selection and reserve your scholarship seat in a particular university, this registration fee will be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?
25/01/24, 1:23 pm - +263 77 763 6776: Alright 

1. Master of Commerce
2. ⁠India
3. ⁠$6,000 - $8,000
4. ⁠about half or less than the cost of studying without a scholarship 
5. ⁠$350 with at least $200 payable in 7 days then the rest in the following 30 days
6. ⁠The Learn While You Learn program helps the student lessen the financial burden of the part of the learning expense that is not covered by Edoofa. It works in such a way that a student earns credits which are worth money and those credits can be transferred to such and go towards covering the financial burden of the student thereby lessening the mount they have left to pay.
7. ⁠I believe I’ve understood and I am clear.
25/01/24, 1:23 pm - Kunal: The annual fee after the scholarship is $2000-$3000

27/01/24, 10:29 am - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: Good Morning Everyone. 
 
*I am Mr. Piyush, The Head of Counselling at Edoofa.* 

I have been evaluating Trevor's application with counselor Mr Kunal.

I believe you have checked the results of the evaluation, since they were shared over the email this morning?
27/01/24, 10:30 am - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: *It gives me immense joy to share with you that as your application is found to be eligible for the Edoofa Scholarship Program👏🏽👏🏽.* 

The results were shared over email, you are supposed to acknowledge them as well.
27/01/24, 10:30 am - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: <Media omitted>
27/01/24, 10:30 am - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: For your convenience, let me share the Letter of Acceptance over here as well so that you can go through it and let me know.
27/01/24, 10:44 am - +263 77 763 6776: Good morning 

I have received the email and acknowledged receiving it via email.

Thank you for believing in me and giving me this opportunity, I appreciate it greatly.
27/01/24, 10:45 am - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: I hope you have gone through your Letter of Acceptance @263777636776?
27/01/24, 10:47 am - +263 77 763 6776: I have and I understand to reserve my seat on the Edoofa program there is a $200 fee that has to be paid by 1 February and the rest of the $150 by 1 March
27/01/24, 10:47 am - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: Indeed @263777636776, meanwhile you must have seen, there are two modes of fee payments mentioned:-

1. Direct Bank Transfer to our Parent Company's account
2. Deposit in our associate's account over there in Zimbabwe

Which mode according to you would be convenient, so that I can brief you in-depth about that particular mode?
27/01/24, 10:50 am - +263 77 763 6776: I believe option 2
27/01/24, 10:52 am - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: Let me help you have a clarity about it please!
27/01/24, 10:53 am - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: @263777636776 basically you see in the first mode, the Direct Bank Transfer Mode, the transfer charges which are to be borne by the parents of the student ranges between $100 to $120 which become quite high for a lot of parents considering the economic situation in Zimbabwe itself. So as not every student is in a position to cater for an additional $100 to $120 just as transfer charge, the second mode was introduced, wherein, it is the Bank deposit in Mr. Charles's Account, in this the transfer charges get divided amongst 10 students resulting in an equivalent bearing of 12.5% at the end.

So as you can see in the letter that there is a Bank deposit in, Mr. Charles Jerera (Retired Education Officer)'s account as he is our Associated Partner there in Zimbabwe, Since 2020 there have been over 1400+ students who have been assisted by Mr Charles inorder to complete their enrollment formalities as well as university fee payments after arriving in India.
27/01/24, 10:53 am - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: Therefore the fee can also be paid through him. Since his account is a NOSTRO Account which only holds USD itself, therefore the necessary amount including the transfer charges in this mode itself would be $394 ($350 + $44 transfer charges), and the same details are as below:-

BANK NAME: FBC

SWIFT CODE: FBCPZWHA

ACC NAME: CHARLES JERERA

27/01/24, 11:01 am - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: As of now would you like to ask anything else please?
27/01/24, 11:27 am - +263 77 763 6776: Are there any processes we can get through before the initial payment is done
