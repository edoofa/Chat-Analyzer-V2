25/01/24, 11:39 am - Kunal: Well, I am sure after seeing all these amazing facts, you are intrigued to study in India. So can you now tell me, How would studying in India implement a positive impact on your career and How do you aim to achieve your career aspirations from studying in India?

As I can see, you have understood the quality of higher education  which Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead.

By any chance are you familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship?
25/01/24, 12:41 pm - +263 77 533 5469: No l am not
25/01/24, 12:41 pm - Kunal: Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth! 

In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc,it is still beyond the reach of many.
With the Edoofa Scholarship Program,the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library,Wifi,Laundry,etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
25/01/24, 12:42 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
25/01/24, 12:42 pm - Kunal: In simple words what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost $3000 or less a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well. 

However, as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even after this we allow the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.

*So do you feel the reduced cost of education is affordable to your family?*
25/01/24, 12:46 pm - +263 77 533 5469: No it is not affordable as they don't even earn half of that money per month it takes a period of 7 months for them to earn it
25/01/24, 12:52 pm - Kunal: I understand
Let me tell you how Edoofa helps Edoofians bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the *Earn While You Learn Program*

The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that are equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable. The Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies and needs, converting an Individual into a market-ready professional. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

25/01/24, 12:58 pm - +263 77 533 5469: Yes l will benefit from the earn while you learn program as l will get to learn different skills
25/01/24, 1:00 pm - Kunal: Indeed,
If I have to help you explain how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable compared to Local Universities, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now, if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, bringing the cost further down to $1000 per year including the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month. _This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly._

*You can see this even in this scholarship credit certificate where one of our star performers, our Proud Edoodians  Masinire Miriam earned $1965 within a year.* I hope you can now realize the power of the EWYL program to reduce the financial pressure on families?
25/01/24, 1:00 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
25/01/24, 1:03 pm - +263 77 533 5469: Yes l realize that
25/01/24, 1:03 pm - Kunal: Great, Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, a few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :

*1. Expert Career Counselling:* We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counsellors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.

*2. Affordability through guaranteed scholarships:* Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off.

*3. Earn While You Learn:* The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing our students for the real world. 

*4.Higher Education Concierge:* A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.*

After going through these facts that make Edoofa different, which one out of the 4 did you feel is the most significant?
25/01/24, 1:07 pm - +263 77 533 5469: 4:Higher Education Concierge
25/01/24, 1:07 pm - Kunal: Great! 
So now I know you focus more on quality education, services and guidance
Let me also show you some monthly earnings of students through Earn While You Learn.

25/01/24, 1:07 pm - Kunal: There is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it  depends upon his/her hard work.
However may I know, who will be helping you with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
25/01/24, 1:09 pm - +263 77 533 5469: My parents will be helping me
25/01/24, 1:12 pm - Kunal: That's completely understandable,
So, I believe you'll be discussing everything with them after we complete today's session. Also after our counseling session I would connect to some of our Beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know the proceedings well.

So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
25/01/24, 1:13 pm - +263 77 533 5469: They are okay with it but the problem is the fees
25/01/24, 1:13 pm - Kunal: May I know what is the problem?
25/01/24, 1:15 pm - +263 77 533 5469: The high fees of $3000
25/01/24, 1:19 pm - +263 77 533 5469: Oky
25/01/24, 1:19 pm - Kunal: Have you gone through this as well, Boitumelo?
25/01/24, 1:20 pm - +263 77 533 5469: Yes
25/01/24, 1:23 pm - Kunal: As I have mentioned that the the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, may I know if you feel this is affordable to your family?
25/01/24, 1:24 pm - +263 77 533 5469: No
25/01/24, 1:25 pm - Kunal: Alright
Have you also considered that this fee will be also reduced by the Earn While You Learn program? Do you think you can benefit from the Earn While You Learn program and make your education more affordable?
25/01/24, 1:25 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
25/01/24, 1:58 pm - Kunal: Please excuse me for some time as I am heading for my lunch. Let us connect at 3:00 pm CAT for the next part of our session. Let me know if you have any challenge with the schedule.

Shall we proceed?
25/01/24, 5:07 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
25/01/24, 6:41 pm - +263 77 533 5469: Yes l can
25/01/24, 6:44 pm - +263 77 533 5469: Okay
29/01/24, 9:50 am - Kunal: Good Morning,

*“If you believe it’ll work out, you’ll see opportunities. If you don’t believe it’ll work out, you’ll see obstacles.” ―Wayne Dyer*

On a positive note, I am here to begin our session
Are you ready?
29/01/24, 11:04 am - +263 77 533 5469: Yes l am ready
29/01/24, 11:07 am - Kunal: It is good to hear from you, Boitumelo
29/01/24, 11:07 am - Kunal: Have you gone through this?
29/01/24, 11:23 am - +263 77 533 5469: I have gone though this video
29/01/24, 11:36 am - Kunal: Alright
Are you confident now that you can earn from the EWYL program and make your education more affordable?
29/01/24, 11:39 am - +263 77 533 5469: Yes now l am confident that l can earn whilst l am learning so that l can be able to fund for my school fees
29/01/24, 11:47 am - Kunal: I am glad to hear that, as studying Internationally would make your career advance at even a greater pace, as you will be transformed to a professional with a Greater Paying Job, which would actually help you in uplifting your family thereby yourself, and provide a peaceful and hassle free life to your parents.
29/01/24, 11:47 am - Kunal: *As we move to the last part of the session, let me highlight a few requirements while a student applies alone* 

*1) Application Form* -An online or offline form that asks for your personal details and academic background.

*2) Statement of Purpose-* An essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and your aspirations for your career.

*3) Letter of Recommendation-* from Senior authorities, School Heads or others on why they recommend you to be a right fit for an international university.
Do you know about other requirements?
29/01/24, 11:50 am - +263 77 533 5469: No l don't know
29/01/24, 11:52 am - Kunal: Let me help you understand
When a student applies alone for an international University, on average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose costs between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally and act as a major parameter to decide the child’s eligibility. If you apply to 5 Universities, the average costs for the mentioned would be $1350-$1750, *without even receiving a guarantee to be selected*

*Edoofa has identified a solution for this uncertainty and unaffordability.* If a student qualifies after the eligibility check, not only does Edoofa help them draft their statement of purpose but also helps in terms of Visa Documentation Assistance, University Session and selection, Individual mentorship, etc, reducing the costs significantly to $750 which is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.

29/01/24, 1:17 pm - Kunal: Good Afternoon
Shall we proceed?
29/01/24, 1:21 pm - +263 77 533 5469: Yes
29/01/24, 1:27 pm - Kunal: Please address this
29/01/24, 4:52 pm - Kunal: Are we connected?
29/01/24, 5:26 pm - +263 77 533 5469: Yes we are
29/01/24, 5:27 pm - Kunal: Please address this and let us proceed
29/01/24, 5:28 pm - +263 77 533 5469: Okay
29/01/24, 5:29 pm - Kunal: The enrollment fee is to be paid only if a child is found eligible for the Edoofa Scholarship Program after passing the eligibility check stage, it includes, 

*Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
*Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
*Earn While You Learn Program and training*
*University sessions and selection*
*A guaranteed scholarship seat*
*Visa Documentation Assistance*
*The Foster and Care throughout the course of an Edoofian*
29/01/24, 5:29 pm - Kunal: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge due to which parents might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short period of 7 days and for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option wherein if the student is found eligible, instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, *parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days thereby reducing the financial pressure.*
29/01/24, 5:30 pm - +263 77 533 5469: Okay l will inform my parents
29/01/24, 5:33 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
29/01/24, 5:35 pm - +263 77 533 5469: Stage 2
29/01/24, 5:35 pm - Kunal: Well,
We are at stage one but we have also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.

In Step 1: Connect with a counsellor- As your counsellor, now we are going through the counselling process, discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

In Step 2:Eligibility Check- The eligibility check includes the interviews with Academic Board and Test.

Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa- If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program- This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.

We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
29/01/24, 5:37 pm - +263 77 533 5469: Yes
29/01/24, 5:37 pm - Kunal: *Step 5:* After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors. They will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. will be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by paying the registration fee within a few weeks.

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education and the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025). <This message was edited>
29/01/24, 5:37 pm - Kunal: Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment,you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.

I hope you are clear with the process.
29/01/24, 5:39 pm - +263 77 533 5469: Yes
29/01/24, 5:46 pm - Kunal: Alright Boitumelo
29/01/24, 5:46 pm - Kunal: ,We have come to the end of your counselling session. Before I guide you Step 2 of the Eligibility Check, I want you to have a full-fledged discussion of the Edoofa program within your family as higher education is supposed to be a family decision. Ensure to include these aspects during the discussions:-

*About the EDOOFA Program and its vision of making Education Affordable and Edoofians Employment Ready.*
*Value of the career of an Edoofian after pursuing higher education in India.*
*The financial aspects and how Edoofa brings in affordability and self-financing opportunities for students.*
29/01/24, 5:46 pm - Kunal: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences,

*Edoofa’s Website- www.edoofa.com* 
*Pictures (Edoofians from Africa studying in India): https://tinyurl.com/3ke35s35*

*Please ensure to go through the FAQ document before the next stage and refer the same to your family as it has answers to most of the queries.* Furthermore, if you have any other queries I would suggest that you note them down and we will discuss them in the next session.

Let me also share a few pictures of the students who are studying in India through the Edoofa Program so that you can witness the exposures and their experiences.

30/01/24, 12:05 pm - Kunal: Greetings to you all

Congratulations on clearing stage 1 of the Edoofa Program I hope you have learned about the program better through the previous sessions. Now, I will guide you to the most important *Eligibility check stage* after addressing your questions. 

Are you ready for the same?
30/01/24, 12:29 pm - +263 77 533 5469: Yes l am ready
30/01/24, 12:45 pm - Kunal: It is good to hear from you
Did you manage to discuss the Edoofa Program with your family, please?
30/01/24, 12:47 pm - +263 77 533 5469: They are coming this weekend so l will discuss with them this weekend
30/01/24, 1:13 pm - Kunal: Noted, Please understand that higher education is a family discussion and it is crucial to discuss as a family and proceed with complete understanding and agreement. Given the current scenario, we are facing an overwhelming number of applications from 29+ countries. Consequently, your application has been allotted a limited timeframe for consideration. The urgency of the situation necessitates immediate action and I insist that you prioritize and expedite the family discussions without delay. Do not hesitate to convey if there are challenges.
30/01/24, 1:14 pm - +263 77 533 5469: Okay thank you
