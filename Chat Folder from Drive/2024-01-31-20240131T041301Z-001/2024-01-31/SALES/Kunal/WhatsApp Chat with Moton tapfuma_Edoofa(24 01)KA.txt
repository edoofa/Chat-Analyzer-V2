25/01/24, 10:57 am - Kunal: Thank you for sharing in detail, I am glad to hear and learn more about Moton. I am delighted that you expressed it genuinely.
25/01/24, 10:57 am - Kunal: As you know, higher education is a big decision that can create a significant impact on your child’s future

As a parent, what are your financial plans and preparations for it so that your child receives access to the best opportunities?
25/01/24, 11:13 am - +27 78 592 2332: Financial plans we starting to save and budget for his education expenses
25/01/24, 11:20 am - Kunal: Alright
As you know, Edoofa Scholarship Program offers 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. The remaining cost after scholarship and cost of Living and Transportation is catered by a student's family

If found eligible, are you in a position to raise them?
25/01/24, 11:24 am - +27 78 592 2332: Yes we are in a position to raise the remaining costs depending on the percentage of scholarship he is going to have then we take it from there
25/01/24, 11:29 am - Kunal: Alright please
The final percentage of the scholarship will be decided after the University Sessions of an Edoofian after his/her enrollment

The percentage of scholarships is determined by the following factors

1) Academic Excellence
2) Merit
3) Previous Experiences
4) Recommendations from Edoofa
5) Statement of Purpose(SOP) 
6) Extracurricular Activities

So the universities will evaluate them to decide the final quantum of the scholarship
25/01/24, 11:42 am - +27 84 443 1135: Ok and when will be that ?
25/01/24, 11:50 am - Kunal: I will be guiding about the same ahead in the session
So, to take forward your evaluation, I would now like you to share with me Moton's previous qualification results i.e form 5 or term and O level results, please?
A picture would be better
25/01/24, 11:57 am - +27 84 443 1135: <Media omitted>
25/01/24, 11:58 am - Kunal: Can you also share O level results?
25/01/24, 11:58 am - +27 84 443 1135: That's form 5 last year end of year
25/01/24, 12:01 pm - +27 84 443 1135: Busy checking I will send as soon as I find them
25/01/24, 12:03 pm - Kunal: Let me brief you that, I want to brief you that the criteria before the pandemic was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is *a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.
