29/01/24, 4:08 pm - Kunal: Alright
Let me brief you that, I want to brief you that the criteria before the pandemic was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is *a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about Rutendo achieving it. <This message was edited>
29/01/24, 4:29 pm - +27 61 274 6133: Yes I'm confident Rutendo achieving up to this level
29/01/24, 4:33 pm - Kunal: Good to hear that
May I know by when you can share the subjects of Rutendo's A level?

29/01/24, 4:52 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
