29/01/24, 12:02 pm - Kunal: Please excuse me for some time as I am heading for my lunch. Let us connect at 1:05 pm CAT for the next part of our session. Let me know if you have any challenge with the schedule.

29/01/24, 12:03 pm - +263 77 804 8645: Okay meet you at 1:05
29/01/24, 1:17 pm - Kunal: Good Afternoon
Shall we proceed?
29/01/24, 1:18 pm - +263 77 804 8645: Hie
Yes
29/01/24, 1:26 pm - Kunal: As you know, Edoofa Scholarship Program offers 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. The remaining cost after scholarship and cost of Living and Transportation is catered by a student's family

If found eligible, are you in a position to raise them?
29/01/24, 1:53 pm - +263 77 804 8645: How does the work as you learn program go about so that the child will be able to raise  the remaining costs
29/01/24, 2:01 pm - Kunal: Let me help you understand Earn While You Learn Program in brief,

Students are given real-time live online projects based on digital marketing, organization management to develop soft skills like communication skills, leadership, presentation skills, teamwork, etc.during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student's performance) which wouldn't be physical cash but they can contribute to a part of their higher education fees and make their university education even more affordable.
The working hours would be flexible and they would be able to make the free time productive.
29/01/24, 2:12 pm - +263 77 804 8645: So if it is the case  we are not able to raise the funds since they are too high for us
29/01/24, 2:17 pm - Kunal: May I know if you do not think that EWYL program can help make the cost of education more affordable?
29/01/24, 2:26 pm - +263 77 804 8645: As for our case we are civil servants in Zimbabwe and our salary are too law to afford Angie's cost of living  and transportation expenses  we have other siblings to cater for. I thought if it's  a scholarship it caters for all her expenses like what is done here in Zimbabwe on the presidential scholarships. So from what I have learnt from explanation we have to fund some of the expenses so we will not afford
29/01/24, 2:37 pm - Kunal: I understand
So, may I know how is Angeline planning to proceed for her education?
29/01/24, 2:40 pm - +263 77 804 8645: We are applying for local universities  then we will compare what's affordable
29/01/24, 3:03 pm - Kunal: Alright

 Our Senior Academician was in Zimbabwe for 4 months last year and let me highlight the importance of this opportunity for Zimbabwean students. I want you to think about this situation, where you are studying at UZ. The Tuition fee at UZ ranges from $1000-$1200 per annum with hikes most of the years. The living expenses in Zimbabwe are much more costly than in India. Even the staple diet sadza costs $1 per meal. So you have to spend around $3 per or more per day for meals. A taxi ride for a short distance costs $1, Wi-Fi costs $120 per month, the living rents are high with hikes and the unemployment rates are increasing. Many students work at petrol pumps, markets, selling SIM cards etc after graduation. You might have observed this. All in all, students studying in Zimbabwe have informed us they have to meet an expense of about $3000 or more per annum.
29/01/24, 3:03 pm - Kunal: At the same time, Edoofians are studying here in India at a cost much less than that of Zimbabwe and even self-sponsoring their education through the Earn While You Learn Program. We also ensure they develop employability skills so that they are job-ready by the time they graduate. I believe you are looking forward to such an opportunity for your child’s career, aren't you?
29/01/24, 4:52 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
29/01/24, 5:03 pm - +263 77 791 3146: Thank you very much
30/01/24, 9:45 am - Kunal: Good morning, everyone

*Everything has BEAUTY, but not everyone sees it.*

With a positive note, I am here to resume the session
Shall we proceed?
30/01/24, 10:05 am - +263 77 483 3312: Mrng too.Sorry an excuse we are buzy now at work
30/01/24, 10:09 am - Kunal: I understand
May I know by when you can be available?
30/01/24, 5:00 pm - Kunal: Let us connect at *12:00 pm CAT tomorrow to resume your session *(In case you have any challenges, please let me know the time you will be available, and we will schedule accordingly)*

Please note that your participation and activeness is an important parameters of evaluation. 

*In case the student is having lessons, the parents can also take part in the session*

Stay Blessed!
