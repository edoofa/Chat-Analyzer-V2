25/09/23, 8:21 am - Kunal: Good day to all,

I trust this message finds you in good health.

Having received your application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, I understand that you are seeking an opportunity not only to study abroad but also to build a career abroad through affordable, accessible, and employable education. However, over the last few days, it seems you haven't been able to respond, possibly due to reasons I am not aware of. This has led to an incomplete discussion regarding your scholarship application.

Often, we might have questions, queries, or doubts in our minds that we hesitate to share with others, assuming we might be judged or not understood properly. I want to assure you that at Edoofa, we are here to help you gain a comprehensive understanding of the entire process and address each and every doubt you may have.

In order to assist you in achieving an 80-100% scholarship, I am looking forward to a positive response from you soon.

Best regards,

Kunal

I trust this message finds you in good health.

Having received your application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, I understand that you are seeking an opportunity not only to study abroad but also to build a career abroad through affordable, accessible, and employable education. However, over the last few days, it seems you haven't been able to respond, possibly due to reasons I am not aware of. This has led to an incomplete discussion regarding your scholarship application.

Often, we might have questions, queries, or doubts in our minds that we hesitate to share with others, assuming we might be judged or not understood properly. I want to assure you that at Edoofa, we are here to help you gain a comprehensive understanding of the entire process and address each and every doubt you may have.

In order to assist you in achieving an 80-100% scholarship, I am looking forward to a positive response from you soon.

Best regards,

Kunal

30/01/24, 10:50 am - +263 71 693 6891: Hello Mr Kunal. We have looked closely at this subject. We realise we have to make our own sacrifices. As such we are committed to raise whatever percentage of expenses we shall be tasked to foot. We feel you could make our position more tenable if you indicated right from the beginning the extent to which you will sponsor Enock.  We have to valuate and appreciate our commitment in good time. We are always faced with uncertain factors in our economy. So it becomes hazardous to work with a sustained budget. May you kindly oblige.
30/01/24, 10:52 am - +263 71 693 6891: Sir, I have just submitted a response above. We shall appreciate your reply.

30/01/24, 11:09 am - +263 71 693 6891: Thank you sir. I shall wait for your reply.
30/01/24, 11:09 am - +263 71 693 6891: Enock will respond as soon as possible.
30/01/24, 11:13 am - +263 71 693 6891: Mr Kunal, allow me to ask. Do you never consider full sponsorship in meriting cases. Surely you may be called upon to apply your highest discretion in severe cases? I am just wondering.
30/01/24, 11:27 am - Kunal: ,The final percentage of the scholarship will be decided after the University Sessions of an Edoofian after his/her enrollment

The percentage of scholarships is determined by the following factors

1) Academic Excellence
2) Merit
3) Previous Experiences
4) Recommendations from Edoofa
5) Statement of Purpose(SOP) 
6) Extracurricular Activities

So the universities will evaluate them to decide the final quantum of the scholarship
30/01/24, 11:52 am - +263 71 693 6891: This information is quite helpful. Thank you. I suppose it is in vain if I tasked you to quantify Enock's sponsorship (roughly) even before the Universities decide? Please sir, I'm sorry to bother you.
30/01/24, 11:53 am - +263 71 693 6891: I'm asking in your personal capacity...
30/01/24, 12:05 pm - Kunal: *The Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees.

30/01/24, 1:29 pm - Kunal: That is fine, Enock
So, to take forward your evaluation, I would now like you to share with me your previous qualification results i.e O level results, please?
A picture would be better
