I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship. 

I hope to get a positive response from you soon.

24/01/24, 12:51 pm - Gurvinder: May I know, what is the issue?

24/01/24, 1:20 pm - +260 97 7712206: I thought that is why I'm available for you to orient me now
24/01/24, 1:29 pm - Gurvinder: Noted, let me brief you.
24/01/24, 1:29 pm - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
24/01/24, 1:29 pm - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
24/01/24, 1:29 pm - Gurvinder: EDOOFA has commended the new government for its dedicated efforts and positive changes in the education sector, including the elimination of school fees, an increase in the number of teachers, and a focus on protecting vulnerable learners, particularly adolescent girls. *Edoofa is proud to support the government in its mission to transform the education sector and achieve sustainable development, aimed at ensuring quality education that is inclusive and equitable for all by 2030.*
24/01/24, 1:29 pm - Gurvinder: With the influx of students from Zimbabwe, we recorded more than 1500 students to the program in each of the last two years. Having a strong network and grasp of more than 100 schools with a panel of Headmasters, teachers, parents, and other educators, we now look to replicate our success in Zambia as well where we have already begun enrolling students since the last 6 months and we have closed 2023 intake with over 1500 students.
24/01/24, 1:30 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
24/01/24, 1:30 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
24/01/24, 1:30 pm - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
24/01/24, 1:52 pm - +260 97 7712206: Wow.. So interesting!
24/01/24, 1:53 pm - +260 97 7712206: What is my role in this case? I mean how would I apply for sponsorship because I am interested
24/01/24, 1:58 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so Mr Muke, as we start Kelvin's counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
24/01/24, 2:24 pm - +260 97 7712206: So who should be counseled, me as the parent or Keke as the candidate
24/01/24, 2:26 pm - Gurvinder: Please you can participate instead of Keke, but if you are busy, I would encourage you to add Keke in the group.
24/01/24, 2:42 pm - +260 97 7712206: I better participate with her
24/01/24, 2:42 pm - +260 97 7712206: Please add her
24/01/24, 2:43 pm - +260 97 7712206: +260773798682
24/01/24, 2:45 pm - Gurvinder: Please add her to the group yourself.
24/01/24, 2:46 pm - ~ MUKE KELVIN added +260 773798682
24/01/24, 10:29 pm - Gurvinder: Well Dear, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you tomorrow again at 10AM CAT to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care.

Have a good day ahead. 
God Bless You!
24/01/24, 11:04 pm - +260 97 7712206: Noted with thanks

Please elaborate on your answers and answer them in points, so that I can understand your application more briefly and assist you in a better way
25/01/24, 2:35 pm - +260 773798682: Noted
25/01/24, 3:07 pm - +260 773798682: My name is Keke Muke. I was born on the 1st of July 2006 in Zambia choma district
I want to be a pilot. I have always loved traveling growing up. Even if I have never had I chance to do so being a pilot is just something that contributed to the love I have for traveling.
I just finished finished my high school last year 2023 at njase girls secondary school located in southern province choma district where we paid k2155 per term
Both my parents are teachers but my mother has not yet been employed. They are the ones who have supposed me through out with my school fees.both my parents have gone to college obtain their degrees and my father obtained his masters in education 
Even as I go abroad I am certain that my parents will continue supporting me
I have four siblings two young brothers, one elder sister at University and one elder brother who's looking for a job
25/01/24, 3:09 pm - Gurvinder: It is a pleasure to know you Keke.
25/01/24, 3:09 pm - Gurvinder: So now as we proceed ahead, I have a question, during your introduction you mentioned you would like to be a pilot, could you please share what motivates you behind this field of study?
25/01/24, 3:15 pm - +260 773798682: What motivated me is a certain young lady who became a pilot at a  19. At first I used to get advice like it's risky, it's hard but I have never really taken that if someone out there managed to do it why should I fail
25/01/24, 3:22 pm - +260 773798682: Not forgetting the love I have for flying even if I have never been in a plane before and my biggest dream to travel to different places. I feel confident about myself that I can and will manage
25/01/24, 3:27 pm - Gurvinder: That is a great motivation Keke, As much as I'd love to offer a pilot aviation course through the Edoofa program, it's important to note that the availability of courses under a scholarship program like Edoofa can be influenced by various factors.

Aviation courses, especially pilot training, come with exceptionally high costs($40000-80000) due to the specialised training, equipment, and flight hours required. Often, scholarship programs like Edoofa focus on more traditional academic courses due to their broader applicability and feasibility within their budgetary constraints.

The expenses associated with aviation courses, particularly pilot training, can surpass the scholarship resources. Additionally, these courses might have specific requirements or certifications that extend beyond the scope of what the scholarship program can offer.

However, if you would like to go ahead with the counselling session, I would love to offer you an Academic course.
25/01/24, 3:32 pm - +260 773798682: Thank you sir I would love to continue with the session

25/01/24, 4:20 pm - Gurvinder: So shall I brief you about the course?
25/01/24, 4:20 pm - +260 773798682: Yes
25/01/24, 4:21 pm - Gurvinder: *B.Sc. in Nutrition and Dietetics* is a 3- year long full- time undergraduate course divided over 6 semesters. It involves the study of food management, promotion of health through healthy food, and primarily focusses on the relationship between the body and food.
B.Sc. in Nutrition and Dietetics essentially involves an advanced learning in ways to enhance the quality of life and overall well-being by promoting healthy diet behaviors and exploring healthier dietary modifications.

The program consists of a comprehensive curriculum that combines the science of nutrition with a broader view of wellness, community and environment, delving into reasons for unhealthy eating behaviors and ways to rectify and improve the same.

Students interested in learning about nutritional matters and food habits, and in training in health care units such as clinics, hospitals and community nutrition in close proximity of doctors, clinicians and dieticians, are best suited for a B.Sc. in Nutrition & Dietetics.

Ideal candidates would have relevant skills such as tact, team spirit and compassion, and an inherent instinct to counsel, guide, and treat patients suffering from diet- based health issues.

Nutrition and Dietetics is fast- growing both as an academic discipline and in practical application, both in India and abroad. Successful graduates of the course interested in further studies in the discipline may pursue M.Sc., M.Phil. and Ph. D in the same subject. Those interested in professionally working in the industry and find lucrative employment opportunities in private sector clinics and hospitals, or may get self-employed.

Other areas of employment include private sector organizations such as leisure cruise companies and private nursing homes. Such graduates may also choose to become psychiatric nursing as a profession where they work with patients suffering from emotional and psychological distress caused from unhealthy diet patterns.
25/01/24, 4:24 pm - +260 773798682: It's just okay sir I can manage

25/01/24, 4:27 pm - +260 773798682: Yes I understood
25/01/24, 4:28 pm - Gurvinder: Since you have understood the course properly can you now tell me in 150 to 200 words that if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself 5 years after the completion of this course and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
25/01/24, 4:33 pm - +260 773798682: If I am provided with this career option five years from now I see myself working for institutions like the UN which will also help me with achieving my dreams for traveling and also through the money I will be making I am positive that I can definitely go for piloting and also by working really hard and sacrificing where it's needed to achieve what I want <This message was edited>

However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

Are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way inorder to transform your career dear?
29/01/24, 12:25 pm - +260 773798682: Yes I am willing to give my 200%hard work and take all the opportunities that come in my way
29/01/24, 12:54 pm - Gurvinder: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
29/01/24, 1:04 pm - +260 773798682: Studying in India would be an amazing opportunity to immerse myself in a different culture, learn from top-notch professors, and gain a global perspective on my field of study. Plus, India has a rich history, vibrant traditions,  I'd love to explore! It's all about embracing new experiences and broadening our horizons.
29/01/24, 1:05 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
29/01/24, 1:08 pm - +260 773798682: If I were given the opportunity to study abroad on a scholarship, I would definitely want to bring back all the knowledge and experiences I gained to contribute to the development of the education system in my country.

By implementing these new approaches, I believe we can improve the quality of education and provide better opportunities for students in my country. It's all about making a positive impact and creating a brighter future for everyone.

29/01/24, 1:33 pm - Gurvinder: I appreciate your sense of hardworking for your community Keke, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?
29/01/24, 1:38 pm - +260 773798682: I understand what you saying having a supportive environment  super important for studying effectively. I believe that studying abroad can provide me with those opportunities and help me gain the knowledge and skills needed to make a positive impact back home.

29/01/24, 1:40 pm - Gurvinder: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?

29/01/24, 1:53 pm - +260 97 7712206: Interesting!
29/01/24, 1:59 pm - +260 773798682: I love that India emphasizes practical skills and hands-on research, it really pushes the boundaries of learning. Having skilled faculty members with real-world expertise is such a valuable asset. And the fact that Indian degrees are recognized worldwide is a big advantage for future career opportunities. The cultural diversity and vibrant campus life in India must make the whole experience even more amazing. It's great to know that education in India is affordable and there are scholarships available to support students. The fact that most courses are taught in English is definitely a plus for international students. And the opportunities for research and innovation in Indian,thinking and creativity. It sounds like studying in India offers so many incredible opportunities.
29/01/24, 2:10 pm - Gurvinder: So now Keke, I hope you must have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead. As of now would you like to ask anything so far?
29/01/24, 2:15 pm - +260 773798682: Yes I have understood and I have no questions as for now
29/01/24, 2:16 pm - Gurvinder: So now moving ahead by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India?
29/01/24, 2:17 pm - +260 773798682: I am not familiar with the expenses
29/01/24, 2:21 pm - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
29/01/24, 2:21 pm - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
29/01/24, 2:21 pm - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
29/01/24, 2:22 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
29/01/24, 2:22 pm - Gurvinder: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*

*after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
29/01/24, 2:23 pm - +260 97 7712206: May I ask a question on behalf of Keke? Quiet well she might have her own career choice, but considering the programs  of study available for sponsorship,  what study program would you recommend for her?
29/01/24, 2:27 pm - +260 773798682: Alright
29/01/24, 2:32 pm - Gurvinder: Please, all the courses mentioned, that she is eligible for are all well pursued and well recognised all over India.
29/01/24, 2:42 pm - +260 97 7712206: This message was deleted
29/01/24, 2:43 pm - +260 97 7712206: Honestly, the $3000 per year is far from being afforded by most Zambian parents especially those in civil service. $ 3000 dollars is equivalent to ZMW 81 000, How an annual salary for most of us in civil service is about ZMW 84000. Many of us have Loans running on the payslip reducing that to annual salary almost by half. How possible can  one afford to sponsor one child at about ZMW 81000 per year when they're other Children who need help and the daily life surviving demands still depend on the little salary. What I mean is that children of Zambian teachers need 100% bursary if they are to pursue better courses because practically speaking it's impossible for a Zambian teacher to sponsor a child for higher education in best courses worse abroad
29/01/24, 2:49 pm - Gurvinder: Please to help parents in such situation, we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.
29/01/24, 2:49 pm - Gurvinder: Shall I brief you about that?
29/01/24, 2:50 pm - +260 97 7712206: This can be proven by a look at payslips of most of us parents  desiring to have our children study abroad. Yes, a parent may be working( just by name), but what we get mostly is  not even enough for hand to month. It's therefore my humble request that you consider my child for 100 % bursary to assist us meet the manageable expenses for my child
29/01/24, 2:51 pm - +260 97 7712206: Alright will appreciate
29/01/24, 2:55 pm - Gurvinder: Mr Muke, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.

30/01/24, 12:17 am - +260 773798682: I have a question about sponsorships are they hundred percent or not

30/01/24, 12:12 pm - Gurvinder: Please refer to this.
30/01/24, 11:30 pm - Gurvinder: Hi Dear, I hope you are doing well.

I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons that I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship. 

I hope to get a positive response from you soon.
30/01/24, 11:31 pm - +260 773798682: I am sorry sir I thought that question was going to my father
