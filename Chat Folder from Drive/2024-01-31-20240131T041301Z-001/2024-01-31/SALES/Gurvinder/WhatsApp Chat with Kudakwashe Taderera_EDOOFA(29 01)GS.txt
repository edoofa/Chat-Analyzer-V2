*I am Mr Gurvinder Singh, Senior Career Counselor at Edoofa*

We have received an application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program from your friend and our student.

I hope I have contacted the right person.

I would like you to come online so that I could discuss with you the form you submitted online and what I was able to understand from the same!
29/01/24, 10:30 am - +263 77 816 9258: Good morning Sir.I take note of this communication. Please you may go ahead discussing with me about the form submitted to you.Am Mr Taderera the father to Kudakwashe Taderera .

You can address me as Mr Gurvinder, we do have Mr Piiyush, Head of Counselling and  Mr Jyotishman, Head of Admissions who will be evaluating your responses for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
29/01/24, 11:39 am - +263 77 816 9258: Thank you Mr Gurvinder.You may go ahead Sir .
29/01/24, 12:05 pm - Gurvinder: Alright, so Mr Taderera, I can see you got to know about the Edoofa Program from Tadiwanashe, is that correct?
29/01/24, 12:07 pm - +263 77 816 9258: Yes
29/01/24, 12:44 pm - Gurvinder: Okay, so can you tell me what all did you learn about the Edoofa Program from Tadiwanashe, also do tell me whether you learnt about Tadiwanashe’s Journey and Experience with the Edoofa Program?
29/01/24, 12:59 pm - +263 77 816 9258: My daughter who has applied for this programme unfortunately did not have sufficient time to interact with Tadiwanashe about the program since her phone developed fault and in the process she lost Tadiwanashe contacts .

I kindly ask for your favour to briefly elaborate to me about the program.From Tadiwanashe's journey and experience with the Edoofa program ,it sounds it is a genuine programme that aims to 
uplift the standards of learners from poor background in Africa .
29/01/24, 1:24 pm - Gurvinder: Noted.
29/01/24, 1:24 pm - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
29/01/24, 1:24 pm - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
29/01/24, 1:24 pm - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
29/01/24, 1:24 pm - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
29/01/24, 1:28 pm - +263 77 816 9258: Yes it is true indeed .I will be glad to be presented with such an opportunity in life.
29/01/24, 1:37 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so Mr Taderera, as we start your counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
29/01/24, 1:40 pm - +263 77 816 9258: Thank you for this information about many other students who are associated with EDOOFA  and this gives me hope and zeal to encourage my daughter and other eligible students to be part of this program.I would glad if my daughter is remembered in this program.

For my brief background ,l am employed in the Ministry of Primary and Secondary Education as a Schools Inspector Infant Department .I was the head of schools before I was elevated to this position .I am stationed at Zvimba District in Mashonaland Province .I supervise 200 hundred schools both primary and secondary ones .

My highest qualification is Masters Degree in Early Childhood Development .

I am now looking for sponsorship to carry out Doctorate program.

Thank you once more again for taking your time to chart with me about EDOOFA Program.
29/01/24, 1:42 pm - +263 77 816 9258: Yes indeed considering my professional status as an educationist ,this will not be a problem.

30/01/24, 9:26 am - Gurvinder: So now I want to appreciate your sense of hardworking for your community Mr Taderera as a Schools Inspector Infant Department, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?
30/01/24, 9:30 am - +263 77 816 9258: Yes I agree with you 100%.
30/01/24, 9:31 am - Gurvinder: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
30/01/24, 9:32 am - +263 77 816 9258: Sure
30/01/24, 9:33 am - Gurvinder: You see Edoofa’s vision to provide every student with an education that is not just affordable but accessible and employable as well can only be achieved by utilizing the infrastructure of Indian Education landscape that has been developed over the last 75+ years since India’s Independence.

30/01/24, 9:42 am - Gurvinder: Please I wish that too, So now Mr Tarderera, I hope you must have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead. As of now would you like to ask anything so far?
30/01/24, 9:49 am - +263 77 816 9258: So far am now more convinced that EDOOFA. Program is real and is the way to go .As a school Inspector who interacts with many  students in schools in Zvimba ,would I become an EDOOFA Ambassador in preaching this good news about EDOOFA ,introducing many more legible students to you .

And from here what is the way forward about my daughter Kudakwashe .
30/01/24, 9:54 am - Gurvinder: Mr Tarderera, becoming an ambassador is very well an option for you, I would personally put in a recommendation for that with the program director and you can discuss that further when we schedule a call for you with him.
30/01/24, 9:54 am - +263 77 816 9258: On another note ,my daughter sent me a response saying BCA course is good and opts for it .
30/01/24, 9:59 am - Gurvinder: That is great.
30/01/24, 9:59 am - Gurvinder: So now moving ahead by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India?
30/01/24, 10:33 am - +263 77 816 9258: Thank you I take note .
30/01/24, 10:33 am - +263 77 816 9258: No idea so far .
30/01/24, 12:09 pm - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
30/01/24, 12:09 pm - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
30/01/24, 12:09 pm - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
30/01/24, 12:09 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
30/01/24, 12:09 pm - Gurvinder: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*

*after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
30/01/24, 1:21 pm - +263 77 816 9258: Ok well explained .
30/01/24, 1:25 pm - Gurvinder: So now shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?
30/01/24, 5:03 pm - +263 77 816 9258: Yes Sir you may go ahead .Sorry today I was out on schools inspection so I faced network challenges .
30/01/24, 11:28 pm - Gurvinder: Dear, I was expecting your response in the counseling session, but you could not get back to me due to some reason so I am about to finish my second counseling slot for the day, I will have to schedule your session for *Tomorrow at 10 am CAT*. 

Please note that I have two counseling slots in a day which are during my working hours from *7:30 am to 4:30 pm CAT Monday to Friday*, so to complete your application you would have to be present during that time. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning. Therefore I would like you to be online at the above-mentioned time for a smooth conversation.
