*I am Mr Gurvinder Singh, Senior Career Counselor at Edoofa*

We have received an application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program from your friend and our student.

I hope I have contacted the right person.

I would like you to come online so that I could discuss with you the form you submitted online and what I was able to understand from the same!
29/01/24, 2:32 pm - +263 77 594 4204: Okay
29/01/24, 2:34 pm - Gurvinder: It is a pleasure to connect with you today Mupandawana,

You can address me as Mr Gurvinder, we do have Mr Piiyush, Head of Counselling and  Mr Jyotishman, Head of Admissions who will be evaluating your responses for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
29/01/24, 2:34 pm - +263 77 594 4204: Alright
29/01/24, 2:35 pm - Gurvinder: Alright, so Mupandawana, I can see you got to know about the Edoofa Program from Panashe, is that correct?
29/01/24, 2:35 pm - +263 77 594 4204: Yes I have
29/01/24, 2:36 pm - Gurvinder: Okay, so can you tell me what all did you learn about the Edoofa Program from Panashe, also do tell me whether you learnt about Panashe’s Journey and Experience with the Edoofa Program?
29/01/24, 2:38 pm - +263 77 594 4204: I learnt nothing actually
29/01/24, 2:40 pm - Gurvinder: Noted, let me brief you about the program myself.
29/01/24, 2:40 pm - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
29/01/24, 2:40 pm - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
29/01/24, 2:40 pm - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
29/01/24, 2:41 pm - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
29/01/24, 2:45 pm - +263 77 594 4204: Yes .that's very true
29/01/24, 2:45 pm - +263 77 594 4204: Sounds like a good program
29/01/24, 2:50 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so Mupandawana, as we start your counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
29/01/24, 2:50 pm - +263 77 594 4204: Yes I do have what it takes
29/01/24, 2:51 pm - +263 77 594 4204: Let's begin
29/01/24, 2:55 pm - Gurvinder: Now Mupandawana, I would like to know you better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about yourself, your career aspiration do include sharing about:-

1. Your highest education level?
2. The course you would like to study?
3. What do your parents do?
4. What is your parent’s highest education level?
5. Who has been supporting you for your Education so far?
6. Who will be supporting you financially for your higher education abroad?
7. Do you have any siblings? if yes, what do they do?
8. May I know which school do you study at and in which province is it located along with that how much was your per-term fee in A level?

Please elaborate on your answers and answer them in points, so that I can understand your application more briefly and assist you in a better way
29/01/24, 3:54 pm - +263 77 594 4204: Okay 
I am Tanaka .i finished my advanced level(upper 6) last year and thats my my highest level of education. 

I grew up and  stay in a high density surbub called Chitungwiza. 

Both my parents are government workers or civil servants..

My parents have been supporting me with my education with the help of a few relatives..

Well I was hoping that I'd get a fully funded scholarship because  my parents will not be able to support me financially abroad.

 Im the first born and I have two younger siblings ,one is in primary school and the other in high school.

 I learnt at Langham girls high in Mashonaland central Province..and the fees was about 400usd per term
29/01/24, 3:55 pm - +263 77 594 4204: I'd like to pursue either civil engineering petroleum or mining and geology

29/01/24, 4:07 pm - Gurvinder: As you said that you hope to get a fully funded scholarship, still after getting the scholarship, the cost of Education for the year is $2000-3000, do you think that your parents and relatives can support you for that?
29/01/24, 4:07 pm - +263 77 594 4204: They cannot
29/01/24, 4:17 pm - Gurvinder: So do you want to continue with the session?

29/01/24, 9:01 pm - +263 77 244 3228: Thank you so much for a fruitful session. We will come back to you Mr Gurvinder after a family discussion
