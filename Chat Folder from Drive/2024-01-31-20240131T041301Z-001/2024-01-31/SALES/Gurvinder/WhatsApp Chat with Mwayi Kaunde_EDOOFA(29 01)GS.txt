30/01/24, 3:24 pm - Gurvinder: It is a pleasure to connect with you today Mwayi,

You can address me as Mr Gurvinder, we do have Mr Piiyush, Head of Counselling and  Mr Jyotishman, Head of Admissions who will be evaluating your responses for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
30/01/24, 3:24 pm - +265 897 61 86 86: Sure
30/01/24, 3:25 pm - Gurvinder: Alright, so Mwayi, I can see you got to know about the Edoofa Program from Sarah, is that correct?
30/01/24, 3:26 pm - +265 897 61 86 86: Yes
30/01/24, 3:26 pm - Gurvinder: Okay, so can you tell me what all did you learn about the Edoofa Program from Sarah, also do tell me whether you learnt about Sarah’s Journey and Experience with the Edoofa Program?
30/01/24, 3:39 pm - +265 897 61 86 86: It's a program which offers scholarships to individuals from 50 to 100 percent
It helps in lack of affordability of education
It also believes that quality education should be accessible to all
30/01/24, 3:40 pm - Gurvinder: That is correct, let me brief you more.
30/01/24, 3:40 pm - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
30/01/24, 3:41 pm - Gurvinder: EDOOFA has commended the new government for its dedicated efforts and positive changes in the education sector, including the elimination of school fees, an increase in the number of teachers, and a focus on protecting vulnerable learners, particularly adolescent girls. *Edoofa is proud to support the government in its mission to transform the education sector and achieve sustainable development, aimed at ensuring quality education that is inclusive and equitable for all by 2030.*
30/01/24, 3:41 pm - Gurvinder: With the influx of students from Zimbabwe, we recorded more than 1500 students to the program in each of the last two years. Having a strong network and grasp of more than 100 schools with a panel of Headmasters, teachers, parents, and other educators, we now look to replicate our success in Malawi as well where we have already begun enrolling students since the last 6 months and we have closed 2023 intake with over 1500 students.
30/01/24, 3:41 pm - Gurvinder: *Our strong relationships with educational institutions, such as Beautiful Gate, Kingdom Builders Academy, Kings Foundation, and Michiru Secondary School, are a testament to the success of the Edoofa Scholarship Program throughout Malawi.*
30/01/24, 3:41 pm - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
30/01/24, 3:44 pm - +265 897 61 86 86: Yes
30/01/24, 3:45 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so Mwayi, as we start your counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
30/01/24, 3:46 pm - +265 897 61 86 86: Indeed
30/01/24, 3:46 pm - Gurvinder: Now Mwayi, I would like to know you better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about yourself, your career aspiration do include sharing about:-

1. Your highest education level?

8. May I know which school do you study at and in which province is it located along with that how much was your per-term fee in A level?

Please elaborate on your answers and answer them in points, so that I can understand your application more briefly and assist you in a better way
