29/01/24, 12:16 pm - +260 97 4065906: Goodmorning Mr Govinda,  Chilando has interest in persuing law studies. Does  this programme offer that discipline.
29/01/24, 12:48 pm - Gurvinder: Please, we do, but we will come to that ahead in the counselling session, right now please tell me you got to know about the program from Taonga, is that right?
29/01/24, 12:55 pm - +260 776798995: Yes
29/01/24, 1:18 pm - Gurvinder: Okay, so can you tell me what all did you learn about the Edoofa Program from Taonga, also do tell me whether you learnt about Taonga’s Journey and Experience with the Edoofa Program?
29/01/24, 3:55 pm - +260 776798995: She told me that edoofa is a scholarship program  initiated by Anhad Edutrain Solutions India. Edoofa believes quality education should be accessible to all and not just the privilege of a few. It is a scholarship program solves  problems of a lack of affordability and employability in higher education. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their academic life. Edoofians are given  mentors who guide them from the beginning to the end.
29/01/24, 3:55 pm - +260 776798995: I was also told about the EWYL program which stands for earn while you learn.The EWYL  programme is a programme that helps pupils to get the opportunity to learn and enhance their skills.  The program helps to finance pupil's education over the scholarship.
29/01/24, 4:01 pm - Gurvinder: That is correct, let me brief you more.
29/01/24, 4:01 pm - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
29/01/24, 4:01 pm - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
29/01/24, 4:01 pm - +260 776798995: Ok
29/01/24, 4:01 pm - Gurvinder: EDOOFA has commended the new government for its dedicated efforts and positive changes in the education sector, including the elimination of school fees, an increase in the number of teachers, and a focus on protecting vulnerable learners, particularly adolescent girls. *Edoofa is proud to support the government in its mission to transform the education sector and achieve sustainable development, aimed at ensuring quality education that is inclusive and equitable for all by 2030.*
29/01/24, 4:01 pm - Gurvinder: With the influx of students from Zimbabwe, we recorded more than 1500 students to the program in each of the last two years. Having a strong network and grasp of more than 100 schools with a panel of Headmasters, teachers, parents, and other educators, we now look to replicate our success in Zambia as well where we have already begun enrolling students since the last 6 months and we have closed 2023 intake with over 1500 students.
29/01/24, 4:01 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
29/01/24, 4:01 pm - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
29/01/24, 4:05 pm - +260 776798995: Yes, ofcourse
29/01/24, 4:16 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so Chilando, as we start your counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
29/01/24, 4:17 pm - +260 776798995: Yes I do
29/01/24, 4:29 pm - Gurvinder: Now Chilando, I would like to know you better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about yourself, your career aspiration do include sharing about:-

1. Your highest education level?
2. The course you would like to study?
3. What do your parents do?
4. What is your parent’s highest education level?
5. Who has been supporting you for your Education so far?

7. Do you have any siblings? if yes, what do they do?
8. May I know which school do you study at and in which province is it located along with that how much was your per-term fee in Grade 12?

Please elaborate on your answers and answer them in points, so that I can understand your application more briefly and assist you in a better way

30/01/24, 3:29 pm - +260 776798995: Yes
30/01/24, 3:30 pm - Gurvinder: Since you have understood the course properly can you now tell me in 150 to 200 words that if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself 5 years after the completion of this course and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?

Preferably specialising in company or family law.I believe having taken principals of accounts and commerce in high school gives me an advantage when it comes to company law.Getting into the edoofa program will allow me to complete this course and become any of the options provided.I am also interested in the earn as you learn program which is been offered.I have dreams of opening my own law firm one day and I believe getting accepted into this program would be one step closer to achieving the desired goals.As mentioned earlier I have a passion for this line of work because I want to help others and be part of the people who serve justice.Taking up any of the occupations listed would allow me to do just that .As a lawyer,judge, public persecutor or company secretary.
30/01/24, 3:49 pm - Gurvinder: That is really great Chilando I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations,

However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

30/01/24, 3:52 pm - Gurvinder: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
30/01/24, 4:02 pm - +260 776798995: I feel like studying abroad offers a wide range of benefits. First of all, it provides an opportunity to study in prestigious institutions with renowned faculty members and cutting-edge resources. This exposure can help me to enhance my academic knowledge and skills in ways that may not be available in my home country. It can  allow me to explore different teaching methods and approaches, which can broaden my perspective and help me develop a more well-rounded educational background. It also offers the chance to collaborate with students from all over the world, fostering cross-cultural understanding and expanding my network. This Is what I think after interacting with taonga when I asked her about the program. <This message was edited>
30/01/24, 4:06 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
30/01/24, 4:16 pm - +260 776798995: Firstly by encouraging other people to take up this course that is believed to be difficult and to some impossible by beginning an example. Encouraging more people to study abroad and to take advantage of scholarships .Most people are ignorant of the many opportunities that come with scholarships and studying abroad. Becoming an example would help people see  and explore education related opportunities like edoofa
30/01/24, 4:17 pm - Gurvinder: I appreciate your sense of hardworking for your community Chilando, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?
30/01/24, 4:17 pm - +260 776798995: I agree
30/01/24, 4:18 pm - +260 776798995: And I'm willing to do do just that
30/01/24, 4:18 pm - Gurvinder: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
30/01/24, 4:19 pm - +260 776798995: Yes
30/01/24, 4:19 pm - Gurvinder: You see Edoofa’s vision to provide every student with an education that is not just affordable but accessible and employable as well can only be achieved by utilizing the infrastructure of Indian Education landscape that has been developed over the last 75+ years since India’s Independence.
30/01/24, 4:19 pm - Gurvinder: *Following are the reasons as to Why Edoofa Focuses on India for Scholarships: A Quick Look!*
