I am Mr Gurvinder Singh, Senior Career Counselor at Edoofa

Welcome to the Edoofa Scholarship Counselling Session

Before we begin with the session, I would like to ask you, what prior understanding you have about the Edoofa Scholarship Program
19/01/24, 10:37 am - +260 97 3157882: Thank you
19/01/24, 10:38 am - +260 97 3157882: It's a  program that offers Scholarships to all in India
19/01/24, 12:28 pm - Gurvinder: Noted, let me brief you clearly.
19/01/24, 12:28 pm - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
19/01/24, 12:28 pm - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
19/01/24, 12:28 pm - Gurvinder: EDOOFA has commended the new government for its dedicated efforts and positive changes in the education sector, including the elimination of school fees, an increase in the number of teachers, and a focus on protecting vulnerable learners, particularly adolescent girls. *Edoofa is proud to support the government in its mission to transform the education sector and achieve sustainable development, aimed at ensuring quality education that is inclusive and equitable for all by 2030.*
19/01/24, 12:28 pm - Gurvinder: With the influx of students from Zimbabwe, we recorded more than 1500 students to the program in each of the last two years. Having a strong network and grasp of more than 100 schools with a panel of Headmasters, teachers, parents, and other educators, we now look to replicate our success in Zambia as well where we have already begun enrolling students since the last 6 months and we have closed 2023 intake with over 1500 students.
19/01/24, 12:29 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
19/01/24, 12:29 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
19/01/24, 12:29 pm - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
19/01/24, 12:34 pm - +260 97 3157882: Yes I do
19/01/24, 2:24 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so Shelly, as we start your counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
19/01/24, 2:26 pm - +260 97 3157882: Yes I do
19/01/24, 3:06 pm - Gurvinder: Now Shelly, I would like to know you better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about yourself, your career aspiration do include sharing about:-

1. Your highest education level?
2. The course you would like to study?
3. What do your parents do?
4. What is your parent’s highest education level?
5. Who has been supporting you for your Education so far?
6. Who will be supporting you financially for your higher education abroad?
7. Do you have any siblings? if yes, what do they do?
8. May I know which school do you study at and in which province is it located along with that how much was your per-term fee in Grade 12?

Please elaborate on your answers and answer them in points, so that I can understand your application more briefly and assist you in a better way
19/01/24, 3:09 pm - +260 97 3157882: I will do so
19/01/24, 3:10 pm - +260 97 3157882: So , when should this be submitted

Through out my life as a learner have always been interested in Mathematics and engineering as a course is all about:
1. Problem solving... Engineering is all about solving real world problems and coming up with innovative technologies and solutions....and I feel this will be highly rewarding and satisfying experience for me and my country Zambia.
2.It is an area that is fascinating to me and uses my strengths to contribute to positive internal motivation. And lastly
3. I have always been curious about the world around me....The few female engineers I see around my community have been a great inspiration to me. I have always admired their power and ambition to achieve their goals in a man's world. I believe engineering is for everyone.
Thank you.

23/01/24, 2:41 pm - Gurvinder: Shelly, if you would have researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*. whereas if they want to study any Engineering Course then they should have *Physics, Chemistry and Maths* in their A level mandatorily.
23/01/24, 2:43 pm - +260 97 3157882: Yes I do have them
23/01/24, 2:46 pm - +260 97 3157882: Are our final results going to determine this
23/01/24, 2:57 pm - Gurvinder: Please, you need to have physics and chemistry separately not combined.

1. Bachelor of Science in Nutrition and Dietetics

2. Bachelor of Science in Microbiology

3. Bachelor of Science in Medical Laboratory Technology

4. Bachelor of Science in Cardiovascular Technology

5. Bachelor of science in Physiotherapy

6.Bachelor of Science in Biotechnology

23/01/24, 3:05 pm - Gurvinder: Please you can pursue Bsc Agriculture and any commercial course.
23/01/24, 3:09 pm - +260 97 3157882: So I can't study engineering
23/01/24, 3:10 pm - Gurvinder: That is correct.
23/01/24, 3:14 pm - +260 97 3157882: Can you please brief me on those courses
23/01/24, 3:15 pm - Gurvinder: Can you please tell me out of all these which do you think you can be interested in?
23/01/24, 3:20 pm - +260 97 3157882: Can you please first tell me more on Bsc Agriculture and Commercial courses

24/01/24, 8:36 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

*"Do the best you can until you know better. Then when you know better, do better. "*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
24/01/24, 8:59 am - +260 97 3157882: Okay but I have a question is it that  the condition u gave about Engineering only apply to civil engineering or Engineering in general
24/01/24, 9:14 am - Gurvinder: Please that is for every Engineering course.
24/01/24, 9:21 am - +260 97 3157882: Oh okay thank you for the clarity
24/01/24, 9:28 am - Gurvinder: May I know, why this hasn't been addressed yet?
24/01/24, 9:33 am - +260 97 3157882: I'm just concluding with it then I will send very soon
24/01/24, 9:35 am - Gurvinder: Noted.
24/01/24, 11:22 am - +260 97 3157882: In 5 years I see myself as a graduate who has gained valuable experience and knowledge through internship and other job opportunities. I hope to have found a fufilling job in my field of Bsc in Agriculture and to have continued learning and growth opportunities.

I see myself doing more research and development, exploring innovative ways to improve agriculture practices and increase crop yield for the Zambian farmers. I also see myself helping farmers optimize their production and ensure that they comply with regulations.

Getting into Edoofa's Program to study BSc Agriculture will enable me have a vast experience and open up a range of exciting career opportunities in the agriculture sector, providing me with the skills and knowledge to make a significant impact in the field. However, the credibility of your degree will prepare me to build a flourishing career in Agriculture.
24/01/24, 11:23 am - +260 97 3157882: I'm very sorry for delaying the network was bad due to the weather
24/01/24, 12:10 pm - Gurvinder: That is really great Shelly I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations,

However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

Are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way inorder to transform your career dear?
24/01/24, 12:17 pm - +260 97 3157882: Yes I am
24/01/24, 12:24 pm - Gurvinder: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
24/01/24, 12:54 pm - +260 97 3157882: Studying abroad is a life -changing experience for everyone and it offers more unique opportunities for those who get a chance. I personally would want to study abroad because
*It will give me a chance to travel to another country.
*It will help me attain good quality education at an adorable expense because of the scholarship.
*It will help me  became more independent.
*It also help me to see things from a different perspective.
*Because I will get to learn an entirely different culture and language which is interesting.
* And of course make new friends. These are some of the reasons why I want to study abroad.
24/01/24, 12:55 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
24/01/24, 1:36 pm - +260 97 3157882: By sharing the improved way of teaching and learning that I may have learnt .  By making ensure that more people get high quality  education and also ensure that everyone is given an opportunity to learn and go to school.
24/01/24, 1:37 pm - +260 97 3157882: Because education is for all
24/01/24, 1:49 pm - Gurvinder: I appreciate your sense of hardworking for your community Shelly, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?
24/01/24, 2:33 pm - +260 97 3157882: Yes I agree
24/01/24, 2:34 pm - Gurvinder: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?

24/01/24, 3:23 pm - +260 97 3157882: Wow that's very nice
24/01/24, 3:25 pm - Gurvinder: So now Shelly, I hope you must have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead. As of now would you like to ask anything so far?
24/01/24, 3:29 pm - +260 97 3157882: When you made it to India  how is accomodations
24/01/24, 3:31 pm - Gurvinder: So now moving ahead by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India?
24/01/24, 3:33 pm - +260 97 3157882: No
24/01/24, 3:33 pm - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
24/01/24, 3:33 pm - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
24/01/24, 3:33 pm - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
24/01/24, 3:33 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
24/01/24, 3:33 pm - Gurvinder: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*

*after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
24/01/24, 3:40 pm - +260 97 3157882: Ohh that's nice
24/01/24, 3:41 pm - Gurvinder: So now shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?
24/01/24, 3:54 pm - +260 97 3157882: Yes please
24/01/24, 4:04 pm - Gurvinder: Shelly, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
24/01/24, 4:07 pm - +260 97 3157882: This is an amazing program
24/01/24, 4:08 pm - Gurvinder: The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

*1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-_*Africa Global Radio*_ - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

-_*Skooqs*_ - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
24/01/24, 4:08 pm - Gurvinder: *2. Recruitment Partners: -*

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
24/01/24, 4:08 pm - Gurvinder: *3. Webinars: -*

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
_Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world_ by *Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade*.
_How to network like a boss_ by *Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi*

24/01/24, 4:08 pm - Gurvinder: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase. 

*What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
24/01/24, 4:19 pm - +260 97 3157882: I think this is a great program and I think it's very beneficial
24/01/24, 4:20 pm - Gurvinder: I am delighted to hear that shelly, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
24/01/24, 4:22 pm - +260 97 3157882: Wow this is great
24/01/24, 4:23 pm - +260 97 3157882: Very good
24/01/24, 10:29 pm - Gurvinder: Well Dear, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you tomorrow again at 10AM CAT to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care.

Have a good day ahead. 
God Bless You!
24/01/24, 10:29 pm - +260 97 3157882: U too
25/01/24, 8:23 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

*"The best way to predict your future is to create it."*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
25/01/24, 9:40 am - +260 97 3157882: Okay
25/01/24, 9:40 am - +260 97 3157882: And yes it can
25/01/24, 9:41 am - Gurvinder: So let us continue the session now.
25/01/24, 9:41 am - Gurvinder: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

25/01/24, 9:42 am - Gurvinder: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
25/01/24, 10:02 am - +260 97 3157882: Yes it is
25/01/24, 10:13 am - Gurvinder: Alright Shelly, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
25/01/24, 10:14 am - +260 97 3157882: Yes
25/01/24, 10:18 am - Gurvinder: Okay so may I know if you have discussed international education plans with them in depth?
25/01/24, 10:20 am - +260 97 3157882: I have because of not knowing whether I will be selected or not so not really in depth
25/01/24, 10:26 am - Gurvinder: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
25/01/24, 10:27 am - +260 97 3157882: Yes I am
25/01/24, 10:29 am - Gurvinder: Shelly as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
25/01/24, 10:35 am - +260 97 3157882: About $ 1,875
25/01/24, 10:36 am - Gurvinder: Exactly Shelly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
25/01/24, 10:36 am - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
25/01/24, 10:38 am - +260 97 3157882: Wow this is great
25/01/24, 10:38 am - Gurvinder: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
25/01/24, 10:40 am - +260 97 3157882: Yes I do
25/01/24, 10:43 am - Gurvinder: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
25/01/24, 10:43 am - Gurvinder: Basically, there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee, before their Grade 12 result is out).


Phase 3: Once the final grade 12 results are out, if the student would have passed the necessary requirement (of 4 Grade 12 passes.) then start with their University Interaction. If the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents.


The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.

However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
25/01/24, 10:47 am - +260 97 3157882: Okay that's very nice
25/01/24, 10:48 am - Gurvinder: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.

Are you familiar with the Edoofa Cycle?
25/01/24, 10:49 am - +260 97 3157882: Not really
25/01/24, 11:54 am - Gurvinder: This message was deleted
25/01/24, 11:55 am - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
25/01/24, 11:55 am - Gurvinder: Alright Shelly, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zambia itself.
25/01/24, 11:55 am - Gurvinder: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
25/01/24, 12:19 pm - +260 97 3157882: Yes I have
25/01/24, 12:20 pm - Gurvinder: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of the registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
25/01/24, 12:20 pm - Gurvinder: Basically, this registration fee will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August/September 2024 and the remaining in January next year 2025.
25/01/24, 12:20 pm - Gurvinder: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
25/01/24, 12:20 pm - Gurvinder: So now would you like to ask anything?
25/01/24, 12:22 pm - +260 97 3157882: So you take the Edoofians to different Universities
25/01/24, 12:32 pm - Gurvinder: Yes, the students can choose from any university that sends them an acceptance letter.
25/01/24, 12:34 pm - +260 97 3157882: Oh okay
25/01/24, 12:35 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check
25/01/24, 12:35 pm - Gurvinder: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
25/01/24, 12:35 pm - Gurvinder: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

Please note that I have two counseling slots in a day which are during my working hours from *7:30 am to 4:30 pm CAT Monday to Friday*, so to complete your application you would have to be present during that time. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning. Therefore I would like you to be online at the above-mentioned time for a smooth conversation.
30/01/24, 7:54 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

*“The best way to predict your future is to create it."*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.

30/01/24, 12:37 pm - Gurvinder: Are your parents active?
30/01/24, 12:53 pm - +260 97 3157882: Currently they're chancing a challenge
30/01/24, 1:02 pm - Gurvinder: Can you please elaborate, what do you mean by that?
30/01/24, 1:04 pm - +260 97 3157882: They're currently not active due to a challenge
30/01/24, 1:05 pm - Gurvinder: May I know, what challenge are they facing?
30/01/24, 11:40 pm - Gurvinder: Hi Dear, I hope you are doing well.

I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons that I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship. 

I hope to get a positive response from you soon.
