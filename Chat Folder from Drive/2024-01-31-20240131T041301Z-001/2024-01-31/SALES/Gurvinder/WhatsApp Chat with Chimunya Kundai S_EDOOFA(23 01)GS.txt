23/01/24, 11:57 am - Gurvinder: Before we begin with the session, I would like to ask you, what prior understanding you have about the Edoofa Scholarship Program
23/01/24, 12:05 pm - +263 77 463 0093: I have an understanding of Edoofa ,as  one which can offer sponsorship to students who may have the opportunity and credentials to study in India.
A
23/01/24, 12:08 pm - +263 77 463 0093: And may offer between 50 to 100 % fees payment to students , depending on ones background
23/01/24, 12:44 pm - Gurvinder: Noted, let me brief you about the program.
23/01/24, 12:44 pm - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
23/01/24, 12:44 pm - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
23/01/24, 12:44 pm - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
23/01/24, 12:44 pm - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
23/01/24, 3:56 pm - +263 77 463 0093: Noted, will ask Kundai to go through and understand the document,then apply
23/01/24, 3:59 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so Mr Chimunya, as we start your son's counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
23/01/24, 4:16 pm - +263 77 463 0093: Noted
23/01/24, 4:17 pm - Gurvinder: So is Kundai available for the session?
23/01/24, 4:18 pm - +263 77 463 0093: Not today, but will organize for another day, 
He has gone to collect his A level Results at his school which is 145 miles away
23/01/24, 4:19 pm - +263 77 463 0093: He will definitely intervene once he has access to network,as soon as he follows the chats
23/01/24, 4:21 pm - Gurvinder: Noted So Mr Chimunya, I would like to know Kundai better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about his, his career aspiration do include sharing about:-

1. His highest education level?
2. The course he would like to study?
3. What do you parents do?
4. What is the parent’s highest education level?
5. Who has been supporting him for his Education so far?

7. Does he have any siblings? if yes, what do they do?

25/01/24, 8:54 am - +263 71 210 3464: <Media omitted>
25/01/24, 8:59 am - Gurvinder: Kundai, Pursuing a Bachelor of Commerce (B.Com) can be a strategic and beneficial step toward becoming an actuarial scientist. Here are a few reasons why:

Solid Foundation in Mathematics and Statistics:

B.Com programs often include core courses in mathematics and statistics, providing a strong foundation in quantitative skills. These skills are crucial for actuarial science, which involves complex mathematical calculations and statistical analysis.
Understanding Financial Concepts:

B.Com covers various subjects related to finance, accounting, and economics. This knowledge is valuable for an actuarial scientist, especially when dealing with financial risks and assessing the impact of different economic factors on insurance and financial planning.
Risk Management and Insurance Knowledge:

Many B.Com programs offer courses in risk management and insurance. Gaining an understanding of risk concepts is fundamental to actuarial science, as actuaries assess and manage risks related to uncertain future events.
Communication and Business Skills:

Actuarial scientists often need to communicate complex findings to non-experts, such as clients or management. B.Com programs typically include courses that enhance communication and business skills, which are essential in a professional setting.
Versatility in Career Options:

B.Com provides a versatile degree that opens up various career paths within the business and finance sectors. In case someone's career plans change or evolve, a B.Com degree can still offer valuable skills and opportunities.
Prerequisites for Actuarial Exams:

Many actuarial organizations require candidates to have a strong foundation in mathematics and finance before taking actuarial exams. A B.Com degree can fulfill these prerequisites, making it easier for students to qualify for and excel in the actuarial exams.
Networking Opportunities:

Being part of a B.Com program allows students to connect with professors, industry professionals, and fellow students who may provide guidance and support as they pursue a career in actuarial science.
In summary, a B.Com degree not only equips students with the necessary mathematical and financial knowledge but also offers a well-rounded education that complements the skills required in actuarial science. It can be a stepping stone toward achieving their goal of becoming an actuarial scientist.
25/01/24, 9:04 am - +263 71 210 3464: Thank you for the enlightenment. This means i have to first undertake this course before becominga an actuary. Can i ask how long it will take to finish the bachelor of commerce
25/01/24, 9:09 am - Gurvinder: *Bachelor of Commerce (B.com)* is a three year long undergraduate course that is evenly distributed into 6 half-yearly semesters. 

A high number of jobs are available for B.com graduates in industries such as Information Technology, Manufacturing, Telecommunications and Banking.The most sought after B.Com. jobs are Financial Manger, Accountant, Lecturer, Chartered Accountant, Human Resource Development etc.

The 3 year B.com degree program aims to facilitate a deep understanding of how business organizations work. It develops knowledge and skills in core B.com subjects like Accounting, Finance, Banking & Insurance, Marketing, Human Resources and Taxation.
The entire B.com syllabus is designed in a manner which develops competency in students, allowing them to pursue higher level programs. It also increases practical knowledge and employability.

*B.Com graduates have a plethora of job positions in government as well as private sectors to choose from provided that they are not limited to careers in accounts and finance*
25/01/24, 9:12 am - +263 71 210 3464: Okay so actuarial science is a post graduate degree and bachelor of commerce is a bachelor degree. Thank you i understand now
25/01/24, 9:15 am - Gurvinder: Yes, that is correct.
25/01/24, 9:15 am - Gurvinder: So did you understand the course?
25/01/24, 9:16 am - +263 71 210 3464: Yes i did thank you. My other question stands at. How long will it take to be a qualified actuary.
25/01/24, 9:16 am - +263 71 210 3464: Yes and i am deeply interested
25/01/24, 9:17 am - Gurvinder: Please after completing this course, it will depend on how long you take to pass the actuarial exams.
25/01/24, 9:19 am - +263 71 210 3464: Okay understood. Thank you
25/01/24, 9:27 am - Gurvinder: Since you have understood the course properly can you now tell me in 150 to 200 words that if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself 5 years after the completion of this course and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
25/01/24, 11:26 am - +263 71 210 3464: Provided the career of being an actuary is successful in a period of 5 years time span , I will be greatly indebted to my parents for their unending support and Edoofa Program for the lifetime opportunity. 

Speaking in mature terms I see myself as a successful and professional being who is kind , respectful and has a zeal to look back and show gratitude to the roots and support that lifted me up in times of crisis and happiness. I am really looking forward to working in a big company such as Workopolis or Iphone in international companies respectful to my corresponding studies. I also see myself travelling the world for various occasions. I would also love to show my appreciation by working for edoofa or help in any way possible to assist other international students who want a journey towards better education in good environments.

This program will ideally help me achieve my dreams which are still now maturing but for now , the dreams to have a car a nice family and live comfortably. My other dreams and responsibilities will start piling up as I embark on the journey from teenage hood to manhood.

With not much time wasted , I would like to thank you Mr Gurvinder and my parents for allowing me this session and hope to commence in admirable and achievable standards. THANK YOU.
25/01/24, 12:01 pm - Gurvinder: That is really great Kundai I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations,

However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

Are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way inorder to transform your career dear?
25/01/24, 12:02 pm - +263 71 210 3464: I am willing
25/01/24, 12:05 pm - Gurvinder: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
25/01/24, 12:12 pm - +263 71 210 3464: There are better economies, opportunities and advantages with having international certificates that will provide me with a competitive edge.
25/01/24, 12:13 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
25/01/24, 12:21 pm - +263 71 210 3464: I will much bring in the practical side of the education in my country to be of greater concern since the theory is excellent. As much I would like to invest I'm creating buildings for zimbabwean scholars to have all IT items and practical items I think it's not possible so what I think I would do is to enable the scholars to be engaged online through online tuitoring and online school to help them with modern technology. That my piece of mind , going online to enhance education
25/01/24, 12:31 pm - Gurvinder: I appreciate your sense of hardworking for your community Kundai, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?
25/01/24, 12:32 pm - +263 71 210 3464: I do agree Mr Gurvinder
25/01/24, 12:35 pm - Gurvinder: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
25/01/24, 12:36 pm - +263 71 210 3464: Yes I wonder why?
25/01/24, 12:43 pm - Gurvinder: You see Edoofa’s vision to provide every student with an education that is not just affordable but accessible and employable as well can only be achieved by utilizing the infrastructure of Indian Education landscape that has been developed over the last 75+ years since India’s Independence.
25/01/24, 12:43 pm - Gurvinder: *Following are the reasons as to Why Edoofa Focuses on India for Scholarships: A Quick Look!*

1. *Robust Education System:* India has 1000+ universities and 39,931 colleges offering diverse educational paths.

2. *Renowned Institutions:* Top-rated Indian universities cover a wide array of fields from engineering to journalism.

3. *Quality Education and Research:* India emphasizes practical skills and hands-on research, pushing your learning boundaries.

25/01/24, 12:57 pm - +263 71 210 3464: Intrigued by the Tesla entity in bengaluru

25/01/24, 12:57 pm - Gurvinder: So now Kundai, I hope you must have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead. As of now would you like to ask anything so far?
25/01/24, 12:58 pm - +263 71 210 3464: For now  I have no more questions Sir.
25/01/24, 1:04 pm - +263 77 463 0093: What an encouraging conversation, I have been watching from the terraces ,as a parent
25/01/24, 1:05 pm - +263 71 210 3464: 🤣🤣
25/01/24, 1:07 pm - Gurvinder: So now moving ahead by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India?
25/01/24, 1:08 pm - +263 71 210 3464: No I am not as for me..and for my parents can you confirm please
25/01/24, 1:14 pm - +263 77 463 0093: We know it will be an arm and a leg, but will do our level best to work for the boy.
Would even appreciate more if you may assist with a schoolaship of any level.
25/01/24, 1:14 pm - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
25/01/24, 1:14 pm - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
25/01/24, 1:14 pm - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
25/01/24, 1:15 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
25/01/24, 1:15 pm - Gurvinder: In simple words Kundai what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well. 

However as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her counselling, eligibility check stage and is thorough throughout the evaluation, then they surely are rewarded with higher quantum of scholarship after which the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, now this , and even *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
25/01/24, 1:18 pm - +263 77 463 0093: Sounds better, and we can work out a plan
25/01/24, 1:18 pm - Gurvinder: So now shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?
25/01/24, 1:19 pm - +263 77 463 0093: Sure sure
25/01/24, 1:20 pm - Gurvinder: @263774630093, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
25/01/24, 1:38 pm - +263 77 463 0093: Great
25/01/24, 1:39 pm - Gurvinder: The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

*1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-_*Skooqs*_ - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
25/01/24, 1:39 pm - Gurvinder: *2. Recruitment Partners: -*

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
25/01/24, 1:39 pm - Gurvinder: *3. Webinars: -*

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
_Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world_ by *Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade*.

25/01/24, 1:39 pm - Gurvinder: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase. 

*What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
25/01/24, 3:27 pm - +263 71 210 3464: This is great insight and I love the fact that Africans are even turning up as Ceo like Yasmin Bitugu and Simon Maingi and the likes.

I am sure this will benefit me
25/01/24, 3:28 pm - Gurvinder: I am delighted to hear that Kundai, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
25/01/24, 3:31 pm - +263 71 210 3464: Okay so the harder you work the better the reward. So will they also acknowledge the efforts of students with hard degrees that will seem as if they are always failing but putting in as much effort. What's the take with that
25/01/24, 3:34 pm - Gurvinder: Kundai, after counselling 1000's of students and seeing 2000 right here in India, I have never seen a student putting in hard work and failing to get compensated for that, so please don't doubt that.
25/01/24, 3:34 pm - Gurvinder: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

25/01/24, 3:35 pm - Gurvinder: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
25/01/24, 3:37 pm - +263 71 210 3464: It definitely is I am amazed
25/01/24, 3:38 pm - +263 71 210 3464: Okay thank you for reassuring me
25/01/24, 3:38 pm - +263 71 210 3464: Okay
25/01/24, 3:39 pm - +263 71 210 3464: Those are nice certificates there
25/01/24, 3:41 pm - Gurvinder: Alright Kundai, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
25/01/24, 3:42 pm - +263 77 463 0093: 💯
25/01/24, 3:42 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so may I know if you have discussed international education plans with them in depth?
25/01/24, 3:57 pm - +263 71 210 3464: Yes I agree
25/01/24, 3:58 pm - Gurvinder: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
25/01/24, 3:58 pm - +263 71 210 3464: Yes I have
25/01/24, 3:58 pm - +263 71 210 3464: Yes
25/01/24, 4:02 pm - Gurvinder: Kundai as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
25/01/24, 4:03 pm - +263 71 210 3464: $1500~$2250
25/01/24, 4:04 pm - Gurvinder: Exactly Kundai, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
25/01/24, 4:04 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
25/01/24, 4:04 pm - +263 71 210 3464: Okay
25/01/24, 4:05 pm - +263 71 210 3464: Which is really good
25/01/24, 4:05 pm - Gurvinder: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
25/01/24, 4:07 pm - +263 71 210 3464: Yes definitely
25/01/24, 4:07 pm - Gurvinder: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
25/01/24, 4:07 pm - Gurvinder: You see Edoofa's exceptional program has opened up a world of opportunities for aspiring students, garnering thousands of applications on a daily basis. The Eligibility Evaluation process ensures that deserving candidates are granted the chance to participate in the program. *Once accepted, students are requested to pay a nominal Program Fee of $350 within 7 days of receiving their acceptance letter*, following which they commence with their admission process and the esteemed Earn While You Learn Program. Edoofa's mission to provide quality education and support to students is at the heart of this initiative, and we are honored to make a difference in the lives of deserving individuals through this program.
25/01/24, 4:07 pm - Gurvinder: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
25/01/24, 4:10 pm - +263 71 210 3464: This is a really good thought from Edoofa since most African economies are in a recession and would definitely help most students without exempting much pressure.
25/01/24, 4:11 pm - Gurvinder: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.

Are you familiar with the Edoofa Cycle?
25/01/24, 4:11 pm - +263 71 210 3464: Okay
25/01/24, 4:12 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
25/01/24, 4:12 pm - Gurvinder: Alright Kundai, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zimbabwe itself.
25/01/24, 4:13 pm - Gurvinder: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
25/01/24, 4:13 pm - +263 71 210 3464: Let me read it
25/01/24, 4:15 pm - +263 71 210 3464: Yes I have understood the process
25/01/24, 4:15 pm - Gurvinder: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of the registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
25/01/24, 4:15 pm - Gurvinder: Basically, this registration fee will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August/September 2024 and the remaining in January next year 2025.
25/01/24, 4:15 pm - Gurvinder: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
25/01/24, 4:16 pm - Gurvinder: So now would you like to ask anything?
25/01/24, 4:17 pm - +263 71 210 3464: No question
25/01/24, 4:17 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check
25/01/24, 4:18 pm - Gurvinder: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
25/01/24, 4:18 pm - Gurvinder: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

30/01/24, 9:11 am - +263 77 463 0093: Good morning ,Mr Gurvinder, do u mind setting a time we can have the session at once,
Since some of my routine work may involve traveling to different business units, hence may disrupt the session
30/01/24, 9:32 am - Gurvinder: *@263774630093*,  I am happy to see that you understand the program details so well. I totally understand that you have work to do and So I really appreciate your cooperation and the time you are taking out to support your child.
30/01/24, 9:33 am - Gurvinder: Please note that the number of scholarship seats is limited in number, and in case *Kundai* is selected for the scholarship we expect that you are clear and aware of all the details shared during the session along with that you also obey the rules and honour the scholarship terms.
30/01/24, 9:33 am - Gurvinder: In case you do not follow these terms then *Kundai’s* entire scholarship process will go into backlog and you will only be able to apply for the scholarship after 6 months. By then the entire fee structure for the scholarship program may increase*.

1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the *4th or 5th of February 2024* for $200 and the *4th or 5th of March 2024* for the remaining $150.
2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the *4th or 5th of February 2024*
