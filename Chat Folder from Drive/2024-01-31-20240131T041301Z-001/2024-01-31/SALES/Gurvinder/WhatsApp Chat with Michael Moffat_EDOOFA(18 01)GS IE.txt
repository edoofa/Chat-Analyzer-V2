The importance of exploring multi cultures

It is significant because students who learn about different cultures and societies during their education feel comfortable and safe with these differences later in life be it at work or home. This gives them a wider room to interact in social groups and feel more confident and belief in themselves as well as interaction with others.
18/01/24, 2:05 pm - Gurvinder: So now can you address this question?
18/01/24, 2:09 pm - +263 71 321 1883: Olk he said that it ranges from 50-100% depending on your performance

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics.

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*

 You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process. Also, they were proactive for at least a day to complete their sessions.
18/01/24, 2:39 pm - Gurvinder: Having said that, I think you will adhere to the above two quantifiers. Do you have any limitations that may hinder you and your Parents from being online for at least TWO-THREE hours today?
18/01/24, 2:41 pm - +263 71 321 1883: No l don't have any limitations
18/01/24, 2:48 pm - +263 78 627 7197: As Michael’s parent I don’t have any limitations

22/01/24, 10:35 am - Gurvinder: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.
22/01/24, 10:35 am - Gurvinder: Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.
22/01/24, 10:39 am - +263 71 321 1883: I already achieved in that, our A-level results came out two weeks back and l got 8 points in Pure Mathematics, Computer Science and Geography

22/01/24, 1:08 pm - Gurvinder: Did you understand the course?
22/01/24, 1:11 pm - +263 71 321 1883: I clearly understand
22/01/24, 1:12 pm - Gurvinder: Since you have understood the course properly can you now tell me in 150 to 200 words that if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself 5 years after the completion of this course and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
22/01/24, 1:27 pm - +263 71 321 1883: I think l will be one of those people who are recognised nationally as youngsters who brought innovation to our country. As l learn this course am sure with some of these skills l will be able to create something that benefits everyone for example a website which enhances production and accuracy in terms of business
22/01/24, 1:46 pm - Gurvinder: That is really great Michael I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations,

However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

Are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way inorder to transform your career dear?
22/01/24, 1:48 pm - +263 71 321 1883: Since greatness requires hardwork, sacrifice and dedication am willing to do put in all my efforts
22/01/24, 1:52 pm - Gurvinder: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
22/01/24, 1:57 pm - +263 71 321 1883: The career path l chose requires the use of computers mostly as well as stable network so in our country we face challenges like these everytime there no adequate machines to test our programs and the network lags every now and then
22/01/24, 2:02 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
22/01/24, 2:08 pm - +263 71 321 1883: Am going to try to simplify things by trying in the developments of websites which provides people with information towards this field so that learner can get to know new updates software developments, new coding techniques
22/01/24, 2:10 pm - Gurvinder: I appreciate your sense of hardworking for your community Michael, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?
22/01/24, 2:12 pm - +263 71 321 1883: I do agree with you on that
22/01/24, 2:13 pm - Gurvinder: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
22/01/24, 2:14 pm - +263 71 321 1883: Yes l was wondering but now I have my answer😊
22/01/24, 2:15 pm - Gurvinder: You see Edoofa’s vision to provide every student with an education that is not just affordable but accessible and employable as well can only be achieved by utilizing the infrastructure of Indian Education landscape that has been developed over the last 75+ years since India’s Independence.

22/01/24, 2:20 pm - +263 71 321 1883: I can see India is dominating in the world and has an impact on most companies 😊
22/01/24, 2:22 pm - Gurvinder: So now Michael, I hope you must have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead. As of now would you like to ask anything so far?
22/01/24, 2:25 pm - +263 71 321 1883: Can an Edoofa student gets exposure to these companies in line with their field of study
22/01/24, 2:26 pm - Gurvinder: Michael in the final year of the course every student in the University gets multiple chances of securing a good job within India itself as all the Universities have Employment Partners which provide students with good paying job!

You see the whole purpose of the Earn While You Learn Program is to make the students of Edoofa so competent that by the time they reach the final year of their education, they should be able to get good job opportunities.
22/01/24, 2:35 pm - +263 71 321 1883: Now I understand
22/01/24, 2:51 pm - Gurvinder: So now moving ahead by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India?
22/01/24, 3:35 pm - +263 78 627 7197: No we are not familiar with any cost
22/01/24, 3:35 pm - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
22/01/24, 3:35 pm - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
22/01/24, 3:35 pm - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*

22/01/24, 3:36 pm - Gurvinder: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*

*after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
22/01/24, 4:11 pm - +263 71 321 1883: How does this work EWYL
22/01/24, 4:16 pm - Gurvinder: Michael, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
22/01/24, 4:24 pm - +263 71 321 1883: Olk l understand 😊
22/01/24, 11:49 pm - Gurvinder: Well Dear, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you tomorrow again at 10AM CAT to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care.

Have a good day ahead. 
God Bless You!
23/01/24, 8:54 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

23/01/24, 8:58 am - +263 71 321 1883: Good morning
23/01/24, 9:14 am - Gurvinder: The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

*1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-_*Africa Global Radio*_ - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

-_*Skooqs*_ - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
23/01/24, 9:14 am - Gurvinder: *2. Recruitment Partners: -*

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
23/01/24, 9:14 am - Gurvinder: *3. Webinars: -*

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
_Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world_ by *Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade*.

23/01/24, 9:14 am - Gurvinder: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase. 

*What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
23/01/24, 9:49 am - +263 71 321 1883: Yes l think I will benefit from this to a larger extend
23/01/24, 10:03 am - Gurvinder: I am delighted to hear that Michael, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
23/01/24, 10:07 am - +263 71 321 1883: So how these points obtained
23/01/24, 10:22 am - Gurvinder: Please these are obtained by successfully completing the given projects.
23/01/24, 10:44 am - +263 71 321 1883: Olk l get it
23/01/24, 11:17 am - +263 71 321 1883: Are these projects assigned to me according to my course?
23/01/24, 12:08 pm - Gurvinder: Please refer to this.
23/01/24, 12:33 pm - +263 71 321 1883: Now I know were it's coming from
23/01/24, 1:22 pm - Gurvinder: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

23/01/24, 1:23 pm - Gurvinder: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
23/01/24, 1:54 pm - +263 71 321 1883: This is wonderful 😊
23/01/24, 1:55 pm - +263 71 321 1883: That's great and l have been looking for such opportunities
23/01/24, 2:04 pm - Gurvinder: Alright Michael, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
23/01/24, 2:07 pm - +263 78 627 7197: Yes that’s true
23/01/24, 2:24 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so may I know if you have discussed international education plans with them in depth?
23/01/24, 2:27 pm - +263 71 321 1883: Yes we have discussed it
23/01/24, 2:29 pm - Gurvinder: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
23/01/24, 2:31 pm - +263 71 321 1883: Yes
23/01/24, 2:31 pm - Gurvinder: Michael as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
23/01/24, 2:34 pm - +263 71 321 1883: $	1500-$2500
23/01/24, 2:35 pm - Gurvinder: Exactly Michael, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
23/01/24, 2:36 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
23/01/24, 2:40 pm - +263 71 321 1883: That's affordable as compared to individual applications
23/01/24, 3:00 pm - Gurvinder: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
23/01/24, 3:22 pm - +263 71 321 1883: That's exactly what I think
23/01/24, 3:24 pm - Gurvinder: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
23/01/24, 3:24 pm - Gurvinder: Michael basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
23/01/24, 3:24 pm - Gurvinder: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
23/01/24, 3:33 pm - +263 71 321 1883: Olk l understand
23/01/24, 3:35 pm - Gurvinder: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.

Are you familiar with the Edoofa Cycle?
23/01/24, 3:37 pm - +263 71 321 1883: Yes l got it from Vitalis
23/01/24, 3:38 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
23/01/24, 3:38 pm - Gurvinder: Alright Michael, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zimbabwe itself.
23/01/24, 3:38 pm - Gurvinder: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
23/01/24, 3:43 pm - +263 71 321 1883: Understood
23/01/24, 3:44 pm - Gurvinder: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of the registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
23/01/24, 3:44 pm - Gurvinder: Basically, this registration fee will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August/September 2024 and the remaining in January next year 2025.
23/01/24, 3:44 pm - Gurvinder: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
23/01/24, 3:44 pm - Gurvinder: So now would you like to ask anything?
23/01/24, 3:46 pm - +263 71 321 1883: This fees is paid annually in installments not per semester?
23/01/24, 3:52 pm - Gurvinder: Please the installments are set by the University itself, not by us.
23/01/24, 3:53 pm - +263 71 321 1883: Olk l get it
23/01/24, 3:58 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check
23/01/24, 3:58 pm - Gurvinder: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
23/01/24, 3:58 pm - Gurvinder: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

7.Yes I’m very clear about it <This message was edited>
24/01/24, 12:33 pm - Gurvinder: Please, the name of the course is Bachelor's in Computer Applications, the cost without scholarship is $6000-8000 and the cost with scholarship comes down to around $2000-3000.
24/01/24, 12:46 pm - +263 78 627 7197: Thank you for the correction
24/01/24, 12:50 pm - Gurvinder: *@263786277197*,  I am happy to see that you understand the program details so well. I totally understand that you have work to do and So I really appreciate your cooperation and the time you are taking out to support your child.
24/01/24, 12:50 pm - Gurvinder: Please note that the number of scholarship seats is limited in number, and in case *Michael* is selected for the scholarship we expect that you are clear and aware of all the details shared during the session along with that you also obey the rules and honour the scholarship terms
24/01/24, 12:50 pm - Gurvinder: In case you do not follow these terms then *Michael’s* entire scholarship process will go into backlog and you will only be able to apply for the scholarship after 6 months. By then the entire fee structure for the scholarship program may increase*.
24/01/24, 12:56 pm - +263 78 627 7197: Okay thank you so much I’m going to do my best in order to meet the standards and mandates of the scholarship
24/01/24, 12:58 pm - Gurvinder: Ideally, as you know, the tentative dates are:
1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the *30th or 31st of January 2024* for $200 and the *30th or 31st of February 2024* for the remaining $150.
2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the *30th or 31st of January 2024*

29/01/24, 10:07 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

*“Set your goals high, and don’t stop till you get there.”*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
29/01/24, 10:07 am - +263 71 321 1883: Good morning ✨
29/01/24, 10:53 am - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
29/01/24, 10:55 am - +263 71 321 1883: Thank you so much
29/01/24, 11:11 am - +263 78 627 7197: Thank you so much this is awesome
29/01/24, 11:56 am - Gurvinder: May I know, did you managed to go through the whole letter with the family?
29/01/24, 1:22 pm - +263 78 627 7197: Yes we have managed to
29/01/24, 1:34 pm - Gurvinder: May I know, are there any questions, you would like to ask?
29/01/24, 1:35 pm - +263 78 627 7197: So if I’m to make the payment I can use Charles Jerera’s banking details?
29/01/24, 1:39 pm - Gurvinder: Yes, that is correct.
29/01/24, 1:39 pm - Gurvinder: Should I explain the mode of payments to you?
29/01/24, 1:43 pm - +263 78 627 7197: Yes please
29/01/24, 1:48 pm - Gurvinder: Basically you see in the first mode, the Direct Bank Transfer Mode, the transfer charges which are to be borne by the parents of the student ranges between $100 to $120 which become quite high for a lot of parents considering the economic situation in Zimbabwe itself. So as not every student is in a position to cater for an additional $100 to $120 just as transfer charge, the second mode was introduced, wherein, it is the Bank deposit in Mr. Charles's Account, in this the transfer charges get divided amongst 10 students resulting in an equivalent bearing of 12.5% at the end.

So as you can see in the letter that there is a Bank deposit in, Mr. Charles Jerera (Retired Education Officer)'s account as he is our Associated Partner there in Zimbabwe, Since 2020 there have been over 1400+ students who have been assisted by Mr Charles inorder to complete their enrollment formalities as well as university fee payments after arriving in India.
29/01/24, 1:48 pm - Gurvinder: Therefore the fee can also be paid through him. Since his account is a NOSTRO Account which only holds USD itself, therefore the necessary amount including the transfer charges in this mode itself would be $394 ($350 + $44 transfer charges), and the same details are as below:-

BANK NAME: FBC

SWIFT CODE: FBCPZWHA

ACC NAME: CHARLES JERERA

ACC NUMBER: 5333038014048828

CONTACT NUMBER: +263 77 376 9854

29/01/24, 2:57 pm - +263 78 627 7197: Thank you so much
29/01/24, 3:11 pm - Gurvinder: So may I know, what is the deadline mentioned on the letter?
29/01/24, 3:13 pm - +263 78 627 7197: 3 February
29/01/24, 3:21 pm - Gurvinder: Yes @263786277197 the due date of the formalities 3rd February, however it would be of great benefit for you incase you manage to complete a part of the formalities on or before 31st January.
29/01/24, 3:21 pm - Gurvinder: While I do understand that the deadline is of 3rd February, the key benefit you as a child would have in this case would be to start the process early with the students who became a part of the Edoofa Program in the Month of January 2024. This inturn would help you to interact with the Admission Team even more early so that you can have a much better financial planning with them.
29/01/24, 3:23 pm - +263 78 627 7197: Okay thank you this makes more sense
29/01/24, 3:28 pm - Gurvinder: So are there any questions, you want to ask?
29/01/24, 3:29 pm - +263 78 627 7197: For now I don’t have
29/01/24, 3:40 pm - Gurvinder: Noted.
30/01/24, 12:51 am - Gurvinder: I will connect with you tomorrow again at 10AM CAT to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care.

Have a good day ahead. 
God Bless You!
