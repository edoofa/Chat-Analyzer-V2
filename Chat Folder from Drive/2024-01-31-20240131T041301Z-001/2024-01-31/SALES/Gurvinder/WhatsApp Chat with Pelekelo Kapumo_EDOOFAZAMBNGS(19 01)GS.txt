19/01/24, 10:32 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning Pelekelo Kapumo!

I am Mr Gurvinder Singh, Senior Career Counselor at Edoofa

Welcome to the Edoofa Scholarship Counselling Session

Before we begin with the session, I would like to ask you, what prior understanding you have about the Edoofa Scholarship Program
19/01/24, 10:34 am - +260 97 3209479: From my understanding, I think the Edoofa scholarship program is about helping deserving students who might not be able to pay for their college/university tuition fees while creating equality while doing it by making it available for different people regardless of their race
19/01/24, 12:17 pm - Gurvinder: That is correct, let me brief you more.
19/01/24, 12:17 pm - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
19/01/24, 12:17 pm - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
19/01/24, 12:17 pm - Gurvinder: EDOOFA has commended the new government for its dedicated efforts and positive changes in the education sector, including the elimination of school fees, an increase in the number of teachers, and a focus on protecting vulnerable learners, particularly adolescent girls. *Edoofa is proud to support the government in its mission to transform the education sector and achieve sustainable development, aimed at ensuring quality education that is inclusive and equitable for all by 2030.*
19/01/24, 12:17 pm - Gurvinder: With the influx of students from Zimbabwe, we recorded more than 1500 students to the program in each of the last two years. Having a strong network and grasp of more than 100 schools with a panel of Headmasters, teachers, parents, and other educators, we now look to replicate our success in Zambia as well where we have already begun enrolling students since the last 6 months and we have closed 2023 intake with over 1500 students.
19/01/24, 12:18 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
19/01/24, 12:18 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
19/01/24, 12:18 pm - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
19/01/24, 12:45 pm - +260 97 3209479: Yes it definitely is
19/01/24, 2:31 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so Nambwae, as we start your counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
19/01/24, 2:55 pm - +260 97 3209479: Yes I do but my parents are deceased so my sisters are my legal guardians
19/01/24, 3:24 pm - Gurvinder: Now Nambwae, I would like to know you better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about yourself, your career aspiration do include sharing about:-

1. Your highest education level?
2. The course you would like to study?
3. What do your parents do?
4. What is your parent’s highest education level?
5. Who has been supporting you for your Education so far?
6. Who will be supporting you financially for your higher education abroad?
7. Do you have any siblings? if yes, what do they do?
8. May I know which school do you study at and in which province is it located along with that how much was your per-term fee in Grade 12?

Please elaborate on your answers and answer them in points, so that I can understand your application more briefly and assist you in a better way

23/01/24, 8:56 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

*“The way to get started is to quit talking and begin doing."*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
23/01/24, 8:56 am - +260 97 3209479: Yes indeed.
23/01/24, 9:12 am - Gurvinder: It is a pleasure to connect with you Miss Kapumo.
23/01/24, 9:12 am - Gurvinder: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
23/01/24, 9:27 am - +260 97 3209479: By helping young people through the sponsoring of their education just as I was in high school and showing them the benefits and also educating them on what I learned from abroad and the experience I had, from that. If given the opportunity to have a larger platform, I'd like to come back and work for my country and also hold seminars in which I can advise the education system of Zambia on ways in which they can implement some of the things we were taught and try to take on that form of teaching so as to not only improve the education system but also increase the number of skilled work force locally.
23/01/24, 9:49 am - Gurvinder: I appreciate your sense of hardworking for your community Pelekelo, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?
23/01/24, 9:52 am - +260 97 3209479: Yes I do
23/01/24, 10:06 am - Gurvinder: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
23/01/24, 10:21 am - +260 97 3209479: Yes
23/01/24, 10:37 am - Gurvinder: You see Edoofa’s vision to provide every student with an education that is not just affordable but accessible and employable as well can only be achieved by utilizing the infrastructure of Indian Education landscape that has been developed over the last 75+ years since India’s Independence.
23/01/24, 10:37 am - Gurvinder: *Following are the reasons as to Why Edoofa Focuses on India for Scholarships: A Quick Look!*

1. *Robust Education System:* India has 1000+ universities and 39,931 colleges offering diverse educational paths.

23/01/24, 11:53 am - Gurvinder: So now Pelekelo, I hope you must have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead. As of now would you like to ask anything so far?
23/01/24, 12:08 pm - +260 97 3209479: So is accommodation fee  inclusive or it's just the tuition fee?
23/01/24, 12:09 pm - +260 97 3209479: And also does Edoofa help its students to find jobs after the completion of their study?
23/01/24, 12:49 pm - Gurvinder: Pelekelo in the final year of the course every student in the University gets multiple chances of securing a good job within India itself as all the Universities have Employment Partners which provide students with good paying job!

You see the whole purpose of the Earn While You Learn Program is to make the students of Edoofa so competent that by the time they reach the final year of their education, they should be able to get good job opportunities.
23/01/24, 12:55 pm - +260 97 3209479: Oh okay that's very good
23/01/24, 1:35 pm - Gurvinder: So now moving ahead by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India?
23/01/24, 1:45 pm - +260 97 3209479: Yes, my sister has an idea some of her friends studied in India
23/01/24, 1:47 pm - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
23/01/24, 1:47 pm - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
23/01/24, 1:47 pm - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
23/01/24, 1:47 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
23/01/24, 1:47 pm - Gurvinder: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*

*after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
23/01/24, 1:49 pm - +260 97 3209479: Okay
23/01/24, 1:59 pm - Gurvinder: So now shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?
23/01/24, 2:00 pm - +260 97 3209479: Yes please
23/01/24, 2:00 pm - Gurvinder: Pelekelo, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
23/01/24, 2:03 pm - +260 97 3209479: Okay
23/01/24, 2:04 pm - Gurvinder: The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

*1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-_*Africa Global Radio*_ - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

-_*Skooqs*_ - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
23/01/24, 2:04 pm - Gurvinder: *2. Recruitment Partners: -*

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
23/01/24, 2:04 pm - Gurvinder: *3. Webinars: -*

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
_Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world_ by *Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade*.

23/01/24, 2:05 pm - Gurvinder: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase. 

*What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
23/01/24, 2:17 pm - +260 97 3209479: Yes, I do. I feel like it will not only help me educationally but also psychologically and help make me more independent.
23/01/24, 2:30 pm - Gurvinder: I am delighted to hear that Pelekelo, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
23/01/24, 2:31 pm - +260 97 3209479: Okay
23/01/24, 2:33 pm - Gurvinder: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

23/01/24, 2:34 pm - Gurvinder: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
23/01/24, 2:38 pm - +260 97 3209479: Yes it is
23/01/24, 3:00 pm - Gurvinder: Alright Pelekelo, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
23/01/24, 3:03 pm - +260 97 3209479: Yes they would
23/01/24, 3:04 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so may I know if you have discussed international education plans with them in depth?
23/01/24, 3:05 pm - +260 97 3209479: I have made them aware of the Edoofa scholarship and they aware of the program
23/01/24, 3:06 pm - Gurvinder: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
23/01/24, 3:07 pm - +260 97 3209479: Yes I am
23/01/24, 3:10 pm - Gurvinder: Pelekelo as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
23/01/24, 3:13 pm - +260 97 3209479: Between $1500-$2250
23/01/24, 3:15 pm - Gurvinder: Exactly Pelekelo, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
23/01/24, 3:15 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
23/01/24, 3:15 pm - +260 97 3209479: Wow
23/01/24, 3:16 pm - Gurvinder: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
23/01/24, 3:17 pm - +260 97 3209479: Yes I certainly do
23/01/24, 3:18 pm - Gurvinder: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
23/01/24, 3:18 pm - Gurvinder: Basically, there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee, before their Grade 12 result is out).


Phase 3: Once the final grade 12 results are out, if the student would have passed the necessary requirement (of 4 Grade 12 passes.) then start with their University Interaction. If the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents.


The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.

However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
23/01/24, 3:27 pm - +260 97 3209479: Okay
23/01/24, 3:29 pm - Gurvinder: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.

Are you familiar with the Edoofa Cycle?
23/01/24, 3:29 pm - +260 97 3209479: No I am not
23/01/24, 3:30 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
23/01/24, 3:30 pm - Gurvinder: Alright Pelekelo, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in COUNTRY itself.
23/01/24, 3:30 pm - Gurvinder: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
23/01/24, 3:33 pm - +260 97 3209479: This message was deleted
23/01/24, 3:33 pm - +260 97 3209479: Yes I do
23/01/24, 3:34 pm - Gurvinder: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of the registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
23/01/24, 3:34 pm - Gurvinder: Basically, this registration fee will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August/September 2024 and the remaining in January next year 2025.
23/01/24, 3:34 pm - Gurvinder: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
23/01/24, 3:34 pm - Gurvinder: So now would you like to ask anything?
23/01/24, 3:38 pm - +260 97 3209479: So what increases the chances of one being accepted into the Edoofian scheme?
23/01/24, 3:39 pm - Gurvinder: Please, just being active in the session and in the interview.
23/01/24, 3:40 pm - +260 97 3209479: Okay
23/01/24, 3:41 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check
23/01/24, 3:41 pm - Gurvinder: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
23/01/24, 3:41 pm - Gurvinder: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

7. After receiving your offer letter from the University, you will have to pay your registration fee in order to finalise your university selection and reserve your scholarship seat in a particular university, this registration fee will be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship.

5. The enrollment fee is 350$ and  is paid in 7 days 
6.  The Earn While You Learn Program is a program designed to help students reduce their annual fee by being assigned projects and assignments to earn credits. It’s the credits earned that will be used to reduce the annual fees. The more credits earned by the student the more the fees is reduced. The credits can be used before their high school results are out. The program will not only benefit the parents financially but also help the students learn skills through this program.
24/01/24, 7:10 pm - +260 97 0602450: 7. Yes sir
24/01/24, 7:19 pm - Gurvinder: *@260970602450*,  I am happy to see that you understand the program details so well. I totally understand that you have work to do and So I really appreciate your cooperation and the time you are taking out to support your child.
24/01/24, 7:20 pm - Gurvinder: Please note that the number of scholarship seats is limited in number, and in case *Pelekelo* is selected for the scholarship we expect that you are clear and aware of all the details shared during the session along with that you also obey the rules and honour the scholarship terms.
24/01/24, 7:20 pm - Gurvinder: In case you do not follow these terms then *Pelekelo’s* entire scholarship process will go into backlog and you will only be able to apply for the scholarship after 6 months. By then the entire fee structure for the scholarship program may increase*.
24/01/24, 7:22 pm - +260 97 0602450: Yes sir, I understand
24/01/24, 7:22 pm - Gurvinder: Ideally, as you know, the tentative dates are:
1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the *30th or 31st of January 2024* for $200 and the *30th or 31st of February 2024* for the remaining $150.
2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the *30th or 31st of January 2024*
24/01/24, 7:22 pm - Gurvinder: Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?
24/01/24, 7:24 pm - +260 97 0602450: The first option would work better for me
24/01/24, 7:28 pm - Gurvinder: So @260970602450 are you willing to follow the seven-day enrollment fee payment deadline protocol, In case @260973209479 gets selected into the program?

30/01/24, 9:36 am - +260 97 0602450: Goodmorning sir, 
I have tried to move my work around but I have failed, I won’t be able to attend this meeting. 
My deepest apologies
30/01/24, 9:42 am - Gurvinder: May I know what happened please?
30/01/24, 11:35 am - Gurvinder: @260970602450 I am expecting to hear from you, may I know what happened pleasse?
30/01/24, 11:36 am - Gurvinder: @260973209479 I have been expecting to hear form you since yesterday, may I know what exactly is going on please?
30/01/24, 11:37 am - +260 97 3209479: My family members are still discussing on the issue because they are saying it's too expensive when you add up all the charges
30/01/24, 12:42 pm - Gurvinder: Can you explain @260973209479?
30/01/24, 12:52 pm - +260 97 3209479: All the charges the first $350 then the $2000-$3000 then the other one mentioned in the letter is way beyond the budget
30/01/24, 1:03 pm - Gurvinder: @260973209479 I feel there is something else going on, since finances mentioned in your Letter of Acceptance are the same that we discussed during the counselling session itself. 

So I feel either your family members are double calculating finances, or there is something else that is the matter of concern!
30/01/24, 1:04 pm - +260 97 3209479: Because when you convert the total charges, flight inclusive and convert it to kwacha its more than k50,000
30/01/24, 1:06 pm - Gurvinder: Which charges @260973209479?
30/01/24, 1:06 pm - Gurvinder: Can you explain me in clear terms, what all did you happen to grasp regarding the entire financial aspect of the Edoofa Program?
30/01/24, 1:07 pm - +260 97 3209479: They didn't expect to spend  more than k50,000 which more than I would pay going to a Zambian university
30/01/24, 1:13 pm - Gurvinder: Like I asked, kindly explain the entire finances Pelekelo?
30/01/24, 1:14 pm - +260 97 3209479: I have
30/01/24, 1:14 pm - Gurvinder: Go ahead, please share that over here once, so that I can help you have a better understanding @260973209479?
30/01/24, 1:16 pm - +260 97 3209479: Okay You calculate the total amount and you'll see it's more than k54,000 in total
30/01/24, 1:24 pm - Gurvinder: @260973209479 how would it be more than K54000 per year please? <This message was edited>
30/01/24, 1:26 pm - Gurvinder: Shall I explain for your better clarity @260973209479?
30/01/24, 1:31 pm - +260 97 3209479: Yes
30/01/24, 1:32 pm - Gurvinder: @260973209479 Firstly are you clear that your enrollment fee of $350 is a one time fee and not a yearly fee please?
30/01/24, 1:36 pm - +260 97 3209479: Yes which is k9,448
30/01/24, 1:38 pm - Gurvinder: Your annual fee after the scholarship if you recall I mentioned would be in the range of $1600-$2300. Which will include your accommodation, food and basic university expenses for the entire year.
30/01/24, 1:39 pm - +260 97 3209479: That's the fee every year?
30/01/24, 1:51 pm - Gurvinder: Yes @260973209479 that is the fee every year, which can be reduced by you as a student through the EWYL program please!
30/01/24, 1:52 pm - +260 97 3209479: Okay
30/01/24, 1:54 pm - Gurvinder: Do you recall the Earn While You Learn Program please?
30/01/24, 2:03 pm - +260 97 3209479: Yes
30/01/24, 2:04 pm - Gurvinder: Now if you even earn $50 a month, in a year can you tell me how much would you have earned @260973209479?
30/01/24, 2:05 pm - +260 97 3209479: $600
30/01/24, 2:05 pm - Gurvinder: How much would be left for your family to cater every year in that case?
30/01/24, 2:07 pm - +260 97 3209479: $1000-$1700
30/01/24, 2:08 pm - Gurvinder: Now if you would convert this, how would this be beyond K50000 a year?
30/01/24, 2:09 pm - +260 97 3209479: The beginning payment of $2300
30/01/24, 2:09 pm - Gurvinder: Even when we talk about starting the education, as you know your parents don't have to complete the annual fee before arrival in India, infact even after arriving in India your parents will have the flexibility to complete the fee formalities in installments.
30/01/24, 2:10 pm - +260 97 3209479: Okay
30/01/24, 2:11 pm - Gurvinder: Therefore as of now your parents would have to only cater for your 

Enrollment fee: $350
Registration fee: $500-$1000 (Adjusted in your first year's fee)
Visa fee: $90
Flight ticket: $450-$550


If you add this up, $1450-$2000
30/01/24, 2:13 pm - Gurvinder: Now let us say your annual fee after scholarship is $1800 and you paid registration fee of $1000 before arrival. 

Upon your arrival, your parents will not have to pay the entire $800 in one part, instead upon arrival your parents will have the flexibility to pay the remaining fee in two installments of 6 months as well!
