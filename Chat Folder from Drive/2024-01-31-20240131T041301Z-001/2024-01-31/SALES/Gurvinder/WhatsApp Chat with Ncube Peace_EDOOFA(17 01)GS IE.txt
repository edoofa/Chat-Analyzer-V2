My job is to introduce the Edoofa scholarship program to those who are interested in studying abroad

I am interested and I'm would like to know more about this program 

-What is your name please

-Wow just like me ... Ok so do you have like a certain expectation of your results ?

I am expecting at least 9 points and above 

- What program would you choose as you know India offers the best education in the medical field and science field?

India offers one of the best education specially in the medical field so medicine ,Radiography or pharmacy will obviously be good options for me and I also think my love for Biology will Influence the passion of undergoing these courses
17/01/24, 3:20 pm - Gurvinder: May I know, if Agatha asked you any more questions?
17/01/24, 3:27 pm - +263 77 137 2401: Agatha then explained to me about the Edoofa scholarship program, and she gave me a chance to ask few questions about what I don't understand, which I did and she explained to me and cleared  all my confusions
17/01/24, 3:30 pm - Gurvinder: Noted.
17/01/24, 3:37 pm - +263 77 137 2401: Thank you
17/01/24, 3:41 pm - Gurvinder: So let me brief you more.
17/01/24, 3:43 pm - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
17/01/24, 3:43 pm - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
17/01/24, 3:43 pm - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
17/01/24, 3:43 pm - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
17/01/24, 3:48 pm - +263 77 137 2401: Yes, please Iam looking forward to the opportunity to be independent, further my studies for higher education and I feel it really reduces the burden on my parents
17/01/24, 3:57 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so Peace, as we start your counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
17/01/24, 4:05 pm - +263 77 137 2401: I have faith in my self, I do have what it takes to meet these two important matrices and try to get a higher quantum of scholarship
17/01/24, 10:04 pm - Gurvinder: Well Dear, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you tomorrow again at 10AM CAT to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care.

In Zimbabwe our medical facilities are poor and according to my research they are few Radiographers hence people have to go outside the country to try access these facilities which is expensive. So I wish to study this course in Radiography and open some centres that are cheap and accessible and also work hand in hand with hospitals as an helping hand In my country especially  in my town.

19/01/24, 4:32 pm - +263 77 137 2401: Now I am really considering my choice,because after your insight on MLT I feel as if it will offer me a better chance of achieving my goal compared to Radiography which will just only limit some of my aspirations.
19/01/24, 4:34 pm - +263 77 137 2401: I will be thinking about considering my options and including MLT as one of my options if possible
19/01/24, 9:31 pm - Gurvinder: Well Dear, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you tomorrow again at 10AM CAT to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind.

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
22/01/24, 8:03 am - +263 77 137 2401: Noted
22/01/24, 8:58 am - Gurvinder: So do you want to go ahead with the course?
22/01/24, 9:03 am - +263 77 137 2401: I have discussed with my parents and I have decided to go ahead with MLT course
22/01/24, 9:49 am - Gurvinder: That is great, so did you understand the course?
22/01/24, 12:46 pm - +263 77 137 2401: I  understood MLT briefly, hence I can not say I understood it.
22/01/24, 1:03 pm - Gurvinder: Since you have understood the course properly can you now tell me in 150 to 200 words that if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself 5 years after the completion of this course and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
22/01/24, 1:38 pm - +263 77 137 2401: Okay noted
22/01/24, 1:50 pm - Gurvinder: Please address this as soon as possible.
22/01/24, 2:34 pm - +263 77 137 2401: - Five years after the completion of a degree in medical laboratory technology, I see myself in a position where I would have acquired the knowledge and the work experience needed  by an individual in MLT.

- The working experience may also improve my interactions and my communication skills with the other personnel in a working or business set up,which is vital if I am to achieve my goals of building laboratories In my society 

- MLT also offers good critical thinking skills and knowledge on how to open my labs, which will be vital.

In five years times I see myself setting a foundation on my project and goal of opening medical facilities, because I would have Invested through my employment. In the same time I would like to further my studies and obtain a Masters degree and PHD in the faculty.

- Edoofa is the only program  that will enable me to achieve my dreams because : it will offer me a good learning experience in a good University and In a country well known for its good scientific and medical studies.
Edoofa will grant a helping hand financially, which will lower my chances of facing financial failure.

Edoofa will also offer me a helping hand in terms of accommodation, and how to adopt into a new country and environment.
22/01/24, 2:51 pm - Gurvinder: That is really great Peace I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations,

However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

Are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way inorder to transform your career dear?
22/01/24, 2:54 pm - +263 77 137 2401: If it is what it means for me to achieve my goal ,I am willing to work hard and take the opportunities that will venture into my journey
22/01/24, 2:55 pm - Gurvinder: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
22/01/24, 3:13 pm - +263 77 137 2401: In Zimbabwe, our economy is not good at all it is harsh to the less privileged. Hence, it is financially difficult to study, especially the courses in the medical field.

Zimbabwean technology is a bit backwards. Hence, some courses are learnt theoretical rather than practical.

In Zimbabwe, our education system is not awesome compared to other countries ,especially those abroad. Hence, our degrees are of less value abroad 

Due to the decrease in significance of our degrees abroad in reduces employment in the Western countries such as the UK hence one is then employed locally were these job offers are not available.

Studying abroad brings about a chance of early employment in countries that are more economically stable

It is also difficult to pursue some courses in Zimbabwe as they require high Alevel passes , especially the courses in medical field hence if you are unfortunate  and under perform your A level your dreams come to an end.
22/01/24, 3:14 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
22/01/24, 3:32 pm - +263 77 137 2401: In terms of improving the learning system, I would offer apprenticeship to those less privileged on MLT if I am to achieve my goal of medical facilities, these apprenticeships will involve operating some machines, repairing these machinery, and performing some simple test, making them able to earn a diploma in MLT and persue the courses in Universities.
I would also beging donation programs where I donate technological materials such as computers to schools and improve the learning systems.

If possible, implement school building projects in rural areas to offer cheaper education to those who can not afford it.

If  I was fortunate to aspire my dreams through Edoofa, I would also like to begin scholarship programs for students in primary, secondary, and tertiary levels of education so that they also pursue their dreams.
22/01/24, 3:33 pm - Gurvinder: I appreciate your sense of hardworking for your community Peace, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?
22/01/24, 3:34 pm - +263 77 137 2401: I strongly agree
22/01/24, 3:35 pm - Gurvinder: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
22/01/24, 3:37 pm - +263 77 137 2401: Yes

Why does Edoofa recommend India?
22/01/24, 3:37 pm - Gurvinder: You see Edoofa’s vision to provide every student with an education that is not just affordable but accessible and employable as well can only be achieved by utilizing the infrastructure of Indian Education landscape that has been developed over the last 75+ years since India’s Independence.
22/01/24, 3:38 pm - Gurvinder: *Following are the reasons as to Why Edoofa Focuses on India for Scholarships: A Quick Look!*

22/01/24, 3:46 pm - +263 77 137 2401: Okay I understand why Edoofa focuses on India,

I never knew that India had this much impact to the world with its innovative way of study hence it is most assured that with hard work in India one is bound to success.
22/01/24, 3:51 pm - Gurvinder: So now Peace, I hope you must have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead. As of now would you like to ask anything so far?
22/01/24, 3:52 pm - +263 77 137 2401: Yes sir
22/01/24, 3:53 pm - Gurvinder: So now moving ahead by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India?
22/01/24, 3:55 pm - +263 77 137 2401: No, this was going to be my first question.
I would like to know how edoofa then reduces or improves the cost of the higher education
22/01/24, 3:57 pm - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
22/01/24, 3:57 pm - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
22/01/24, 3:57 pm - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
22/01/24, 3:57 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
22/01/24, 3:57 pm - Gurvinder: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*

*after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
22/01/24, 4:09 pm - +263 77 137 2401: Okay noted

So Edoofa is a good and cheap program
22/01/24, 4:10 pm - Gurvinder: So now shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?
22/01/24, 4:10 pm - +263 77 137 2401: Yes please
22/01/24, 4:10 pm - Gurvinder: Peace, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
22/01/24, 4:15 pm - +263 77 137 2401: Okay I understand
22/01/24, 4:17 pm - Gurvinder: The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

*1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-_*Africa Global Radio*_ - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0

-_*Skooqs*_ - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
22/01/24, 4:17 pm - Gurvinder: *2. Recruitment Partners: -*

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
22/01/24, 4:17 pm - Gurvinder: *3. Webinars: -*

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
_Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world_ by *Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade*.
_How to network like a boss_ by *Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi*
_How to be industry ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer!_ by *Ms. Yasmin Bitugu*
_It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship_ by *Mr. Ronard Kachaje*

22/01/24, 4:17 pm - Gurvinder: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase. 

*What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
22/01/24, 4:27 pm - +263 77 137 2401: I really feel like this will benefit me, because it prepares one to be able to create a chance where there is nothing and earn out if it and this is vital in our day to day life, it makes the edoofians graduates different from other graduates
22/01/24, 11:44 pm - Gurvinder: Well Dear, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you tomorrow again at 10AM CAT to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care.

Have a good day ahead. 
God Bless You!
22/01/24, 11:47 pm - +263 77 137 2401: Thank you
23/01/24, 8:54 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

*“The way to get started is to quit talking and begin doing."*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
23/01/24, 9:04 am - +263 77 137 2401: Noted
23/01/24, 9:22 am - Gurvinder: I am delighted to hear that Peace, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
23/01/24, 1:23 pm - Gurvinder: Are we still connected?
23/01/24, 1:51 pm - +263 77 137 2401: I am connected, my wifi was down today ,I sincerely apologise for the late reply
23/01/24, 1:51 pm - Gurvinder: So is the issue resolved now?
23/01/24, 1:51 pm - +263 77 137 2401: Yes they sorted the issue
23/01/24, 1:54 pm - +263 77 137 2401: Okay I can understand, I can see it makes the studies cheaper
23/01/24, 2:02 pm - Gurvinder: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

23/01/24, 2:02 pm - Gurvinder: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
23/01/24, 2:02 pm - +263 77 137 2401: I am interested
23/01/24, 2:10 pm - +263 77 137 2401: I can realize the difference and its for the better, this is something that I have been looking for regarding my higher education
23/01/24, 2:29 pm - Gurvinder: Alright Peace, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
23/01/24, 2:35 pm - +263 77 137 2401: My family members will supporting my higher education, especially my parents
23/01/24, 2:36 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so may I know if you have discussed international education plans with them in depth?
23/01/24, 2:37 pm - +263 77 137 2401: have discussed international education with them
23/01/24, 2:37 pm - +263 77 137 2401: I have discussed international education with them.
23/01/24, 2:59 pm - Gurvinder: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
23/01/24, 2:59 pm - +263 77 137 2401: This message was deleted
23/01/24, 3:00 pm - +263 77 137 2401: I am noted sir
23/01/24, 3:03 pm - Gurvinder: Peace as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
23/01/24, 3:05 pm - +263 77 137 2401: Around $1500-$2250
23/01/24, 3:06 pm - Gurvinder: Exactly Peace, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
23/01/24, 3:06 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
23/01/24, 3:08 pm - +263 77 137 2401: I can understand
23/01/24, 3:10 pm - Gurvinder: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
23/01/24, 3:13 pm - +263 77 137 2401: It is true. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission for international students.
23/01/24, 3:13 pm - Gurvinder: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
23/01/24, 3:14 pm - Gurvinder: Peace basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
23/01/24, 3:14 pm - Gurvinder: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
23/01/24, 3:17 pm - +263 77 137 2401: Noted sir, I understand.
23/01/24, 3:18 pm - +263 77 137 2401: What will ne the next phase?
23/01/24, 3:19 pm - Gurvinder: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.

Are you familiar with the Edoofa Cycle?
23/01/24, 3:21 pm - +263 77 137 2401: Yes, Agatha explained it to me.
23/01/24, 3:22 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
23/01/24, 3:23 pm - Gurvinder: Alright Peace, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zimbabwe itself.
23/01/24, 3:23 pm - Gurvinder: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
23/01/24, 3:25 pm - +263 77 137 2401: I have understood them properly.
23/01/24, 3:26 pm - Gurvinder: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of the registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
23/01/24, 3:26 pm - Gurvinder: Basically, this registration fee will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August/September 2024 and the remaining in January next year 2025.
23/01/24, 3:26 pm - Gurvinder: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
23/01/24, 3:26 pm - Gurvinder: So now would you like to ask anything?
23/01/24, 3:30 pm - +263 77 137 2401: So if the University gives you few weeks to pay registration fee. Approximately howmany weeks are likely to be offered?
23/01/24, 3:31 pm - Gurvinder: Please, that is decided by the University itself, but our admissions team will help you financially plan that.
23/01/24, 3:32 pm - +263 77 137 2401: I understand.
23/01/24, 3:32 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check
23/01/24, 3:32 pm - Gurvinder: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
23/01/24, 3:33 pm - Gurvinder: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

I believe you must have gone through the entire counselling session once again with your family members.

Are we good to proceed with your eligibility check evaluation now?
24/01/24, 1:37 pm - +263 77 137 2401: I discussed with my parents but right now they are at work, and my father's working hours end at 17:00pm and my mother at 18:00pm

24/01/24, 7:01 pm - +263 78 424 5544: Yes he has been advising us youth we may want to understand more from you
24/01/24, 7:02 pm - +263 78 424 5544: Though not youth
24/01/24, 7:02 pm - Gurvinder: Can you please tell me what aspects of the program you want to know more about?
24/01/24, 7:05 pm - +263 78 424 5544: Ours is to know about financial aspects, that is around his up keep when he is in India and medical cover. How is it covered
24/01/24, 7:06 pm - +263 78 424 5544: If he happens yo secure a scholarship, are we to pay for his air ticket, kindly up date us on that
24/01/24, 7:11 pm - +263 77 865 5334: If he is to go as a medical doctor what A level points are needed in India
Yes we know he is interested in radiography or other related desciplines
24/01/24, 7:16 pm - Gurvinder: Please, the total cost of education in India with one's upkeep was around $6000-8000, we as an organization having the goal of providing a student with an education that is accessible, affordable, and employable brought it down to $2000-3000, and after that we give them a chance to self finance their education with the EWYL program, which also teaches them real life job essential skills and help them learn responsibility, then we touched upon the space that when a student applies to an Internationa University, the cost of the application, the Statement of Purpose, Recommendations in total costs about $300-$450 and if he wants to apply to multiple Universities, then that is a huge financial burden on the parents, so we offer the students that we will apply to multiple Universities for you, make your applications, write your SOPs, get you recommendations, and charge them only $350.
24/01/24, 7:18 pm - +263 78 424 5544: 2000-3000 dollars, Peace was saying is annually confirm it correct
24/01/24, 7:18 pm - Gurvinder: To answer that question, to pursue medicine in India requires Physics also which Peace didn't have, I could have offered him a course in Radiography but after understanding his goals of opening multiple Labs in your area for the poor and be a successful man, I offered him a course in Medical Lab Technology, which aligns with his goals perfectly and gives him a broad spectrum of opportunities to get successful in that.
24/01/24, 7:19 pm - Gurvinder: Yes, that is correct.
24/01/24, 7:21 pm - +263 78 424 5544: It's okay, update on the travel arrangements so that we know whether we are to prepare for his air ticket in the event he is successful
24/01/24, 7:24 pm - Gurvinder: Yes, the cost of travel is a one-time expense that you have to bear, but I assure you that our VISA experts will be there to guide you through the whole process.
24/01/24, 7:25 pm - +263 78 424 5544: Its okay

*“The best way to predict your future is to create it."*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
30/01/24, 7:58 am - +263 77 137 2401: Good morning sir.
Noted.
30/01/24, 8:27 am - +263 78 424 5544: We are happy indeed. Payment will be made even before the 3rd
30/01/24, 8:48 am - Gurvinder: Yes @263784245544 the due date of the formalities 3rd February, however it would be of great benefit for you incase you manage to complete a part of the formalities on or before 31st January.
30/01/24, 8:48 am - Gurvinder: While I do understand that the deadline is of 3rd February, the key benefit you as a child would have in this case would be to start the process early with the students who became a part of the Edoofa Program in the Month of January 2024. This inturn would help you to interact with the Admission Team even more early so that you can have a much better financial planning with them.
30/01/24, 8:55 am - +263 77 137 2401: Indeed, it is vital to begin  the interaction with the admission team early for much better financial planning.
30/01/24, 8:57 am - Gurvinder: So Peace, would your parents be planning to complete the formalities before 31st itself?
30/01/24, 9:00 am - +263 77 137 2401: My parents are planning to complete the formalities by 31st.
30/01/24, 9:04 am - Gurvinder: Glad to know that Peace, since you must have seen, there are two modes of fee payments mentioned:-

1. Direct Bank Transfer to our Parent Company's account
2. Deposit in our associate's account over there in Zimbabwe

Which mode according to you would be convenient, so that I can brief you in-depth about that particular mode?
30/01/24, 9:09 am - +263 77 137 2401: I opt for the second option, which is deposit in your associate's account.
30/01/24, 9:22 am - Gurvinder: Basically you see in the first mode, the Direct Bank Transfer Mode, the transfer charges which are to be borne by the parents of the student ranges between $100 to $120 which become quite high for a lot of parents considering the economic situation in Zimbabwe itself. So as not every student is in a position to cater for an additional $100 to $120 just as transfer charge, the second mode was introduced, wherein, it is the Bank deposit in Mr. Charles's Account, in this the transfer charges get divided amongst 10 students resulting in an equivalent bearing of 12.5% at the end.

So as you can see in the letter that there is a Bank deposit in, Mr. Charles Jerera (Retired Education Officer)'s account as he is our Associated Partner there in Zimbabwe, Since 2020 there have been over 1400+ students who have been assisted by Mr Charles inorder to complete their enrollment formalities as well as university fee payments after arriving in India.
30/01/24, 9:23 am - Gurvinder: Therefore the fee can also be paid through him. Since his account is a NOSTRO Account which only holds USD itself, therefore the necessary amount including the transfer charges in this mode itself would be $394 ($350 + $44 transfer charges), and the same details are as below:-

BANK NAME: FBC

SWIFT CODE: FBCPZWHA

ACC NAME: CHARLES JERERA

ACC NUMBER: 5333038014048828

CONTACT NUMBER: +263 77 376 9854

30/01/24, 9:24 am - Gurvinder: For your reference, I have shared a few recently completed fee receipts, once you complete the formality using this mode you would receive a similar receipt please.
30/01/24, 9:28 am - +263 78 424 5544: We will paying tomorrow. The bank is in Victoria falls 100km from where we are. Definitely tomorrow Peace will be going to falls for depositing the money
30/01/24, 9:29 am - +263 77 137 2401: Noted.So am I supposed to get in touch with Mr Charles  before I deposit the fee.
30/01/24, 9:29 am - +263 78 424 5544: This has made it easier for us. Thank you
30/01/24, 9:31 am - Gurvinder: Oh, well @263784245544 , you see a lot of students who stay in the outskirts of the towns prefer using alternative fee completion mode that saves them the traveling expenses. Since I am aware that in Zimbabwe if you have to travel from one town to another you end up spending anywhere between $5-$10 one side, which becomes expensive considering just to go to the bank and complete the formalities. 

So alternatively the Board has provided flexibility to parents who wish to complete formalities to Mrs Jerera using Ecocash and Mukuru. Shall I share those details with you as well for your convenience please?
30/01/24, 9:39 am - +263 78 424 5544: Absolutely, I will do so through Mukuru platform 
Kindly send the details

30/01/24, 1:57 pm - +263 78 424 5544: At the moment I do not have . I'm now concentrating on making payment. Its all okay may be after payment when we get into the next phase of the process.
30/01/24, 1:59 pm - Gurvinder: Alright @263784245544, so may I know when are you planning to complete the formalities please?

30/01/24, 2:05 pm - Gurvinder: @263784245544 there is no challenge, you can go ahead and complete the fee today itself please!

I had taken an off duty from  tomorrow so that I do the payment early morning. Because today as we knock off from Mukuru will be closed.

30/01/24, 2:14 pm - Gurvinder: Alright @263784245544 in that case you can let me know once the fee is completed so that I request the Admission's team to start Peace's admission process immediately
30/01/24, 2:20 pm - +263 78 424 5544: Definitely, tomorrow we are on it. By 0930 if possible you should  be receiving proof of payment
