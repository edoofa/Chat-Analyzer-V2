06/01/24, 12:30 pm - +263 71 574 2762: Well, Done on sharing the form 🌟 
It has been shared with our dedicated counseling team. In the meantime, it is crucial that you maintain regular communication with the student and address any queries they may have. Our counseling team will be reaching out to them directly within the next 15-20 days.
06/01/24, 12:30 pm - +263 71 574 2762: After I submitted my form I got this message
06/01/24, 12:32 pm - +263 71 574 2762: His name is Edward Kawadza
06/01/24, 12:37 pm - Gurvinder: Noted.
06/01/24, 12:38 pm - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the program.
06/01/24, 12:38 pm - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
06/01/24, 12:38 pm - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
06/01/24, 12:38 pm - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
06/01/24, 12:38 pm - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
06/01/24, 10:48 pm - +263 71 574 2762: That's true
08/01/24, 8:21 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

*"Education is the passport to the future, for tomorrow belongs to those who prepare for it today."*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
08/01/24, 11:34 am - +263 71 574 2762: Noted 👍🏼
08/01/24, 11:40 am - Gurvinder: Okay so Lavendar, as we start your counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
08/01/24, 11:43 am - +263 71 574 2762: I do believe that I have what it takes to meet the two important metrics you have notified me about
08/01/24, 11:44 am - +263 71 574 2762: As for my guardian's participation I can give you her number if that is ok

13/01/24, 9:39 am - Gurvinder: After understanding your interests and motivation toward the Subject
According to my expertise, the following course will cater to all your likings and will help you achieve your future goals:

*B.A. (Hons.) in Sociology*
13/01/24, 10:08 am - +263 71 574 2762: Can you tell me more about what a career in sociology might look like?
13/01/24, 10:29 am - Gurvinder: *B.A. (Hons.) in Sociology* is an undergraduate program that deals with various aspects of social behavior and its consequence on modern society. Sociology is a branch of study which investigates multiple aspects of society and social behavior which helps them to do social work. A Bachelor's degree in Sociology teaches the fundamental concepts related to the structure of society, organization of society, and how humans interact within these constructs. The basic subject matter of Sociology concerns itself with topics related to family structure, global warfare, religious cults, social class, race, and gender, etc.
13/01/24, 10:29 am - Gurvinder: *Course Outline*

This program provides you with an understanding of core traditions and contemporary developments in sociological thinking and research. The theories and methods we explore enable us to examine the character and workings of the social institutions that govern people’s lives and encourage us to critically question the social values we live by. This program provides you with an understanding of core traditions and contemporary developments in sociological thinking and research.

13/01/24, 10:30 am - Gurvinder: *Career Opportunities*

This degree course enables the students to go for various Sociology related jobs such as in industry, commerce, the NHS, education authorities, further and higher education, and charitable, counseling, and voluntary organizations.
One can go for higher degree programs in respective subjects for further research work in Sociology.

Opportunities also exist for sociology graduates in the civil service and graduate management training schemes. Sociology graduates work with a varied and diverse client group during the course of their career.

*Bachelor of Arts in Sociology* includes a number of compulsory subjects. Along with that, the students will also have to choose from a number of elective subjects. The elective subjects may differ from college to college.
13/01/24, 10:34 am - +263 71 574 2762: Understood
13/01/24, 11:34 am - Gurvinder: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.
13/01/24, 11:34 am - Gurvinder: Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.
13/01/24, 12:44 pm - Gurvinder: As it's the weekend, Now we will connect on Monday at 9:30 AM. Please be online during your session time!

In the meantime please go through the links I am sharing for a better understanding of the program

15/01/24, 9:31 am - +263 71 574 2762: Yes I did 👍🏼
15/01/24, 9:55 am - Gurvinder: Since you have understood the course properly can you now tell me in 150 to 200 words that if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself 5 years after the completion of this course and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
15/01/24, 11:58 am - +263 71 574 2762: Five years after completing my degree in sociology, I would like to see myself working in the field of social work. I would like to work for a government or private organization that helps people in need. This would enable me to use the knowledge and skills I have gained from my degree to make a positive difference in the lives of others. If I were to be accepted into Edoofa's program, I believe it would provide me with the opportunity to develop my skills further and gain valuable experience in the field of social work.I could gain experience in research methods, data analysis, and program evaluation. I could also develop communication and interpersonal skills, which are crucial in the field of social work. Additionally, I could gain experience in working with diverse populations, which would be invaluable in a career based on the field of social work.
15/01/24, 12:41 pm - Gurvinder: That is really great Lavender I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations,

However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

Are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way inorder to transform your career dear?
15/01/24, 1:12 pm - +263 71 574 2762: I'm willing to give my all
15/01/24, 1:18 pm - Gurvinder: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
15/01/24, 1:36 pm - +263 71 574 2762: There are many benefits to studying abroad, such as gaining a new perspective on the world, developing cross-cultural communication skills, and expanding my worldview. These benefits can lead to a more enriched personal and professional life. Plus, studying abroad can provide opportunities to experience new cultures and traditions, and build lifelong friendships with people from all over the world.
15/01/24, 1:48 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
15/01/24, 9:09 pm - Gurvinder: Hi Dear, I hope you are doing well.

I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons that I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship. 

I hope to get a positive response from you soon.
15/01/24, 9:29 pm - +263 71 574 2762: I would like to point out that a lot of countries, including my own, are struggling with problems in their education systems, such as lack of access to quality education, outdated curriculum, and a lack of funding. Based on what I learn from studying abroad, I would like to help address these issues by working with local schools and organizations to implement new, innovative solutions. I would also like to share my experiences and knowledge with others, to help inspire others to pursue a better education system for my country.
15/01/24, 9:30 pm - +263 71 574 2762: I am having difficulties accessing the internet due to a lack of electricity, which means I have limited battery power.  this is a common issue where I live, and it is outside of my control. I am still interested in pursuing the scholarship, but my circumstances are impacting my ability to communicate.
16/01/24, 8:42 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

*“The best way to predict your future is to create it."*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.

16/01/24, 10:43 am - Gurvinder: I understand.
16/01/24, 10:44 am - Gurvinder: I appreciate your sense of hardworking for your community Lavendar, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?
16/01/24, 10:54 am - +263 71 574 2762: Thank you for your kind words and yes, I completely agree with you. In order to make a positive impact on my community and country, I need to have a strong foundation of knowledge and experience. And in order to achieve that, I need to focus on my studies and put in the hard work and dedication that is required. But at the same time, I also need to have a supportive environment, where I can get the resources and opportunities I need to succeed. It's a complex situation, and it's not easy to solve. But I'm determined to do my best.
16/01/24, 12:14 pm - Gurvinder: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
16/01/24, 12:39 pm - +263 71 574 2762: That's true
16/01/24, 12:55 pm - Gurvinder: You see Edoofa’s vision to provide every student with an education that is not just affordable but accessible and employable as well can only be achieved by utilizing the infrastructure of Indian Education landscape that has been developed over the last 75+ years since India’s Independence.

After reading about all the great opportunities available, I am even more excited about the possibility of pursuing my studies there. I am especially drawn to the idea of gaining hands-on experience through research and practical learning. This would be a valuable experience that I could carry with me throughout my career.
16/01/24, 1:50 pm - Gurvinder: So now Lavender, I hope you must have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead. As of now would you like to ask anything so far?
16/01/24, 1:52 pm - +263 71 574 2762: No I do not have any questions.
16/01/24, 2:01 pm - Gurvinder: So now moving ahead by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India?
16/01/24, 2:02 pm - +263 71 574 2762: No we are not
16/01/24, 2:12 pm - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
16/01/24, 2:12 pm - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
16/01/24, 2:12 pm - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
16/01/24, 2:12 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
16/01/24, 2:13 pm - Gurvinder: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*

*after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
16/01/24, 3:03 pm - +263 71 574 2762: I understand
16/01/24, 3:07 pm - Gurvinder: So now shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?
16/01/24, 3:26 pm - +263 71 574 2762: Yes please
16/01/24, 3:32 pm - Gurvinder: Lavender, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
16/01/24, 3:44 pm - +263 71 574 2762: I understand 👍🏼
16/01/24, 3:54 pm - Gurvinder: The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

*1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-_*Africa Global Radio*_ - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

-_*Skooqs*_ - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
16/01/24, 3:54 pm - Gurvinder: *2. Recruitment Partners: -*

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
16/01/24, 3:54 pm - Gurvinder: *3. Webinars: -*

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
_Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world_ by *Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade*.
_How to network like a boss_ by *Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi*

16/01/24, 3:54 pm - Gurvinder: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase. 

*What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
16/01/24, 4:13 pm - +263 71 574 2762: Thank you for the comprehensive overview of Edoofa's Education for All program. It's clear that you have created a well-rounded program that covers all aspects of a student's journey, from education to professional development. I am particularly interested in the opportunities for professional development. I believe that this program would be an invaluable experience for me.
16/01/24, 4:13 pm - Gurvinder: I am delighted to hear that Lavender, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
16/01/24, 4:18 pm - +263 71 574 2762: I understand 👍🏼
16/01/24, 10:44 pm - Gurvinder: Well Dear, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you tomorrow again at 10AM CAT to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care.

Have a good day ahead. 
God Bless You!

17/01/24, 8:52 am - Gurvinder: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
17/01/24, 9:05 am - +263 71 574 2762: This program is truly extraordinary, and I am grateful for the opportunity to learn more about it. The potential for a students to cover their education costs on their own is incredible.
17/01/24, 9:11 am - Gurvinder: Alright Lavendar, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
17/01/24, 9:29 am - +263 71 574 2762: Yes that's right
17/01/24, 9:52 am - Gurvinder: Okay so may I know if you have discussed international education plans with them in depth?
17/01/24, 3:55 pm - +263 71 574 2762: Yes i have
17/01/24, 9:48 pm - Gurvinder: Well Dear, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you tomorrow again at 10AM CAT to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind.

18/01/24, 1:36 pm - Gurvinder: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
18/01/24, 2:45 pm - +263 71 574 2762: Yes I am
18/01/24, 2:48 pm - +263 71 574 2762: Unfortunately the network here is down
18/01/24, 3:27 pm - Gurvinder: Lavender as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
18/01/24, 3:32 pm - +263 71 574 2762: If the average cost of applying to one university is $350, and a student applies to five universities, the total cost would be $1750.
18/01/24, 3:52 pm - Gurvinder: Exactly Lavender, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
18/01/24, 3:52 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
18/01/24, 4:05 pm - +263 71 574 2762: I understand and It's really helpful to know that the Program is working to make studying abroad more accessible for students.
18/01/24, 4:07 pm - Gurvinder: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
18/01/24, 4:13 pm - +263 71 574 2762: I do agree and it sounds like a great opportunity for international students.
18/01/24, 11:39 pm - Gurvinder: Well Dear, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you tomorrow again at 10AM CAT to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care.

*“Your efforts matter, your dreams are worth pursuing, and you have the power to make a positive impact. "*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference
19/01/24, 9:52 am - +263 71 574 2762: Noted.
19/01/24, 12:07 pm - Gurvinder: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
19/01/24, 12:08 pm - Gurvinder: Lavender basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
19/01/24, 12:08 pm - Gurvinder: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
19/01/24, 8:15 pm - +263 71 574 2762: I think the flexible fee payment policy is a brilliant idea, and it has the potential to open up the Program to even more students who might otherwise not have been able to participate
19/01/24, 9:14 pm - Gurvinder: Dear, I was expecting your response in the counseling session, but you could not get back to me due to some reason so I am about to finish my second counseling slot for the day, I will have to schedule your session for *Tomorrow at 10 am CAT*. 

Please note that I have two counseling slots in a day which are during my working hours from *7:30 am to 4:30 pm CAT Monday to Friday*, so to complete your application you would have to be present during that time. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning. Therefore I would like you to be online at the above-mentioned time for a smooth conversation.

23/01/24, 9:11 am - Gurvinder: Alright Lavender, as you can see, we are currently at Step 1. After this step, you will proceed to Step 2. If you successfully pass Step 2, you will receive your Acceptance Letter from the Edoofa Academic Board in Step 3. After that, as shown in the image above, the completion of your Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4.

Upon completing your formalities, in Step 5: we will initiate your Edoofa Admission Process and your Earn While You Learn Program. We will assign your complete application to our Admission Officers and the Head Coach of the Earn While You Learn Program.

The Admission Officers will be responsible for assisting you with all the required admission documentation that we discussed earlier, including the Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendation, and the completion of applications in all of Edoofa’s Associated Universities, etc.

The Head Coach will be responsible for assigning your application to the Earn While You Learn Program Mentor, who will then evaluate your candidature and assist with projects and assignments throughout your journey with the Edoofa Program.
23/01/24, 9:11 am - Gurvinder: As an organization that has positively impacted the lives of tens of thousands of African students, we understand that over 97% of parents face financial challenges when planning for their child’s tertiary education. In fact, it is one of the most prominent fears because of which there are parents who despite understanding the kind of growth their child would get through international education, still opt for their children to study in their home country.

Now in our quest to overcome this challenge, I would like to inform you that in Stage 5, while our Admission officers assist with all the necessary admission-related documentation, Edoofa’s Financial Planning team will connect with your parents to help them plan finances for your higher education.

Since in the majority of African nations inflation is a real challenge, keeping in mind that the cost of living in your home country increases atleast by 20% year on year, Financial Planning officers will be responsible for helping your parents plan for your tertiary education in a way that ensures they are not burdened financially throughout your education. Financial planning would include the following aspects:-
*Budgeting for your higher education, as per your parent's affordability.*
*Supporting your parents in building your tertiary education fund.*
23/01/24, 9:11 am - Gurvinder: I hope you now have an in-depth understanding of what happens in Stage 5 of your Edoofa Cycle?
23/01/24, 1:23 pm - Gurvinder: Are we still connected?
23/01/24, 1:25 pm - +263 71 574 2762: Yes I understand
23/01/24, 1:25 pm - +263 71 574 2762: Yes
23/01/24, 1:26 pm - Gurvinder: In Step 6: Once the Financial Planning Team assists your parents in budgeting for your higher education, moving forward you will receive offer letters from the universities where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to complete the required registration process,  as well as finalizing the University. *In order to reserve your seat in any particular University chosen by you a registration fee would have to be paid which would be adjusted through your budgeting done in Stage 5 of the Edoofa Cycle.*

*NOTE:- The registration fee adjusted is not an additional cost, rather it is a part of your first year’s annual fee*
23/01/24, 1:26 pm - Gurvinder: *After a few weeks of your registration process, you will be given your Final Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL), which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
23/01/24, 1:26 pm - Gurvinder: So now would you like to ask anything?
23/01/24, 1:27 pm - +263 71 574 2762: I have no questions
23/01/24, 1:28 pm - +263 71 574 2762: I understand
23/01/24, 1:28 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check
23/01/24, 1:28 pm - Gurvinder: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

24/01/24, 12:19 pm - +263 77 513 7870: The Earn While You Learn Program is an innovative concept that aims to bridge the gap between university education and the job market. Under this program, students are given real-time, live projects to work on. They get to earn scholarship credits based on their performance on these projects, which can be used to offset a portion of their higher education fees. This program helps students gain valuable work experience while also making their education more affordable.

I was waiting for you to share your concerns with me but unfortunately, I didn’t hear from you and therefore I was asked to put your application on hold, but before doing the same, I was going through the form you submitted, I noticed that you come from a family background wherein you plan to pursue your higher education abroad and was looking for a scholarship. I am looking forward to hearing from you so that I can make your dream of higher education abroad come true through an affordable, accessible, and employment-oriented higher education program.

Since the time you applied for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, I was hoping to connect with you and take your application forward to check your eligibility for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, but since you didn’t respond, I am afraid I will have to put a formal closure to your application. Feel free to connect with me again, when you think you are ready to proceed further.
