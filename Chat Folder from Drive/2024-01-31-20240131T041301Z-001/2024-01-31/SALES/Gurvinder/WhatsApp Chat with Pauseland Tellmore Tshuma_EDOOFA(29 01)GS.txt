29/01/24, 9:41 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning Pauseland, Mr and Mrs Tshuma!

*I am Mr Gurvinder Singh, Senior Career Counselor at Edoofa*

We have received an application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program from your friend and our student.

I hope I have contacted the right person.

I would like you to come online so that I could discuss with you the form you submitted online and what I was able to understand from the same!
29/01/24, 9:47 am - +263 78 588 0702: Good morning to you too. I am Pauseland and yes you have contacted the right person.
29/01/24, 10:30 am - Gurvinder: It is a pleasure to connect with you today Pauseland,

You can address me as Mr Gurvinder, we do have Mr Shubham, Senior Academician and  Mr Jyotishman, Head of Admissions who will be evaluating your responses for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
29/01/24, 10:48 am - +263 78 588 0702: Okay
29/01/24, 11:44 am - Gurvinder: Alright, so Pauseland, I can see you got to know about the Edoofa Program from Sinqobile, is that correct?
29/01/24, 11:45 am - +263 78 588 0702: Yes it is correct
29/01/24, 12:05 pm - Gurvinder: Okay, so can you tell me what all did you learn about the Edoofa Program from Sinqobile, also do tell me whether you learnt about Sinqobile’s Journey and Experience with the Edoofa Program?
29/01/24, 1:11 pm - +263 78 588 0702: Okay I learnt that the Edoofa program is a scholarship program that helps meritorious students to further their studies abroad and it provides 50% or 100% scholarship depending on what the student got. There is also an earn while you learn program that compensate the students effort through paying part of the tuition fee that parents are supposed to contribute. 

I have learnt a bit about Sinqobile's journey and her experience with the Edoofa Program. So far it has been a good program that gives a student no doubts about getting help with furthering studies abroad
29/01/24, 1:31 pm - Gurvinder: That is correct, let me brief you more.
29/01/24, 1:31 pm - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
29/01/24, 1:31 pm - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
29/01/24, 1:31 pm - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
29/01/24, 1:31 pm - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
29/01/24, 2:33 pm - +263 78 588 0702: Okay I clearly understand everything now
29/01/24, 2:34 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so Pauseland, as we start your counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
29/01/24, 2:35 pm - +263 78 588 0702: Yes it is , I really want to help my parents reduce the financial burden
29/01/24, 2:36 pm - Gurvinder: Now Pauseland, I would like to know you better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about yourself, your career aspiration do include sharing about:-

1. Your highest education level?
2. The course you would like to study?
3. What do your parents do?
4. What is your parent’s highest education level?
5. Who has been supporting you for your Education so far?
6. Who will be supporting you financially for your higher education abroad?
7. Do you have any siblings? if yes, what do they do?
8. May I know which school do you study at and in which province is it located along with that how much was your per-term fee in A level?

Please elaborate on your answers and answer them in points, so that I can understand your application more briefly and assist you in a better way
29/01/24, 2:38 pm - +263 78 588 0702: Yes I think l have what it takes  to meet those two significant metrics and score a higher quantum of scholarship

*Bachelor of Arts - Bachelor of Legislative Law*
30/01/24, 3:42 pm - +263 78 588 0702: Okay
30/01/24, 3:42 pm - Gurvinder: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.
30/01/24, 3:42 pm - Gurvinder: Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.
30/01/24, 3:45 pm - +263 78 588 0702: Okay noted . I understand  and l am confident that l will achieve the maximum points

A course in BA LLB is an exciting one that offers multiple career opportunities. The 5 key positions associated with this course are:

The main role of a legal advisor or legal counsellor is to offer legal advice and work, for organizations and the employees of the organization. Their services can be utilized by the Government, NGOs, other associations or large organizations. The legal advisors are in-house experts, in contrast to attorneys and supporters who offer their services to society in general. It is often seen that legal advisors were former advocates and therefore their skills and training have to be in accordance with those that are needed for attorneys and advocates.
*2) Lawyer*
As is evident by the title, is a person whose profession is law. There are different specializations for law including Cyber law, Environmental law, Company law, Criminal law and Family Law.

Their role starts once the police have investigated and filed the charge sheet in court. The expectation from the Public Prosecutor is that he acts in the interests of the general public and is fair and ethical. The criminal procedure code of 1973 under section 24, outlines the arrangements concerning the Public Prosecutor.
*4) Judge*
This role is considered to be very prestigious by any law student. Immediately after the completion of graduation, an individual can appear for a lower judiciary exam. The age group depending on different states varies between 21 to 35 years. The qualities of righteousness, good ethics and a passion for justice are some of the key qualities needed for this job.
*5) Company Secretary*
This job is for students who want to work in the corporate sector. This job requires a degree from ICSI or the Institute of Company secretaries of India. A lot of dedication and hard work is required to complete this course with your law degree, but on successful completion, this career can be extremely rewarding.
A career in law is considered to be much sought after, satisfying and lucrative.
30/01/24, 3:56 pm - +263 78 588 0702: Okay so if l may ask a student who wants to become a judge must first complete graduation as a lawyer then start upgrading?
30/01/24, 3:56 pm - Gurvinder: Yes, that is correct.

I believe that in five years time after the the completion of this course I would have brought a change on unfairly served justice. I see myself as a happy , determined and  satisfied  young lawyer who would have achieved the desire of being a lawyer
30/01/24, 11:24 pm - Gurvinder: Well Dear, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you tomorrow again at 10AM CAT to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind.
