*I am Mr. Piyush, The Head of Counselling at Edoofa and we also have with us Ms Pallika Career Counselor and Mr. Jyotishman, the Head of Admissions.* 

We have received an application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program for Brian Nherera. 

I hope I have contacted the right person?
16/01/24, 11:12 pm - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: As we were flooded with applications today and we didn't want to rush your application, so I have managed to reserve a time slot *tomorrow morning at 9:30 AM CAT*, I would appreciate if you stay active and connected at the given time for a 2-hour counseling session so that we can process your application

In the meantime, I am leaving you with a video do go through it properly
16/01/24, 11:12 pm - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: <Media omitted>
17/01/24, 9:05 am - +263 77 351 2405: Sorry Brian returned to school he is doing his A level hope he will apply again just after his completion
17/01/24, 9:28 am - Pallika Edoofa: Greetings to you all,
As scheduled, I am here to begin your sessions for the Edoofa Scholarship Program and evaluate your application.

Are you ready to begin?
17/01/24, 11:15 am - +263 77 351 2405: Not ready this time
17/01/24, 11:18 am - Pallika Edoofa: Mr Misheck I understand, since schools in Zimbabwe have reopened, students are currently engaged in lessons and exam preparations, rendering them unavailable. This situation contrasts with Western African countries where students have already received their results. Consequently, there is a high likelihood that scholarship seats could be filled by students from these regions, posing a potential disadvantage for Zimbabwean students.

These factors particularly affect boarding students and those who are restricted from using devices in school. By the time they return, the opportunity may have been taken by other applicants. To address this concern, our Academic Board, in consultation with universities, has decided to allow parents to participate in the seat reservation interview for their children. This ensures that no deserving applicant is overlooked.
17/01/24, 11:18 am - Pallika Edoofa: So as of now parents do have a chance in representing their child under the evaluation process, so would it be possible for us to have a discussion regarding the same please?
17/01/24, 3:46 pm - +263 71 662 4353: Yes it is the right person
17/01/24, 3:48 pm - +263 71 662 4353: Yes the process can continue
17/01/24, 3:54 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright! Before proceeding please add your mother too
17/01/24, 3:54 pm - +263 71 662 4353: Okay
17/01/24, 3:55 pm - +263 71 662 4353: And by the way ,I'm at school so I will be coming online here n there on my free time ..maybe my parents will cover some stuff for me.
17/01/24, 3:56 pm - +263 71 662 4353: She's already in the group
17/01/24, 4:00 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright!
17/01/24, 4:01 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Brian, it's good to see that you've invested time in understanding the program and submitting your application. Could you please share:

Chemistry.
20/01/24, 12:59 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Let me brief you that, I want to brief you that the criteria before the pandemic was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is *a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.
20/01/24, 1:00 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Also, As your evaluation progresses, I appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country. In this process did you do any prior research on foreign education or applied to any University abroad?
20/01/24, 1:04 pm - +263 77 878 3230: No we haven't applied or researched for any university abroad
20/01/24, 1:04 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>

​*B.Tech Civil Engineering*



Do you want me to explain the course in depth?
29/01/24, 10:54 am - +263 77 878 3230: Yes of course
29/01/24, 11:04 am - Pallika Edoofa: Sure
29/01/24, 11:04 am - Pallika Edoofa: ​*B.Tech Civil Engineering: What is it About?*

Civil engineering is one of the oldest engineering disciplines in the world. Civil engineering, until a few decades back, was a much sought after course among Indian students, but lately has been sidelined due to the software and IT boom. However with the increasing need to develop and maintain India’s infrastructure, which is lagging in all aspects, this field is bouncing back strongly.

There are options for higher studies after the completion of B.Tech. course. Students can pursue Master’s degree in specialized course. Master of Technology (M.Tech.) in Civil engineering and other allied branches like-

*Structural Engineering*
*Architectural Engineering*
*Geotechnical Engineering*
*Environmental Engineering etc.*

*B.Tech Civil Engineering: Who should opt?*

Before you decide to pursue your undergraduate studies in this field, it is important to understand that Civil engineering is not just about buildings and bridges. If you are under the assumption that all that civil engineers do is wear a yellow helmet and supervise workers in construction sites, then you are yet to understand the true capacity of this field. 


*Career aspects*

In these cases, you will have to hunt for a core engineering job all by yourself through off-campus placements. Creating strong professional networks, developing a great resume with stellar GPA and doing impressive projects and internships will help you secure a job in one of the core civil engineering companies.

Also, civil engineers find work not just in construction industry, but also in other industries such as oil and energy, transportation, petroleum, environmental, power and electric utilities, chemical etc where infrastructure projects and construction facilities are involved. Some students transition to software, consulting or banking as they feel that salary and growth prospects are better in these sectors.
29/01/24, 11:04 am - Pallika Edoofa: *I hope this course aligns with what you are aiming for Brian*
29/01/24, 11:20 am - +263 77 878 3230: Yes I have understood. .thanx for highlighting

29/01/24, 11:25 am - +263 77 878 3230: As he said he is willing to do it .you can  continue

29/01/24, 1:57 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That is amazing, As I can see, you have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead.

*By any chance are you familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship?*
29/01/24, 2:01 pm - +263 77 878 3230: No,I'm not familiar
29/01/24, 2:02 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That’s alright, Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India compared to other global hubs.

In India, international students face an average expense of *$6000-$8000 annually.* While this is very low as compared to the Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc where the cost of education ranges from $15000-$35000 annually, it is still beyond the reach of many.

With the Edoofa Scholarship Program, the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000 per annum* for the students who are found eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility Check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Laundry, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*

29/01/24, 2:18 pm - +263 77 878 3230: We will work hard to afford the costs
29/01/24, 2:19 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Good to know, 
So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians. Looking at this cost of education as well, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits which can help in reducing their fees further.

Do you know how that is done?
29/01/24, 2:25 pm - +263 77 878 3230: It's good to know that Edoofa offers work opportunities to students and by so doing reducing their schoolarship credits..I m willing to know how this is done
29/01/24, 2:27 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That’s alright, Let me tell you how Edoofa helps Edoofians bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the *Earn While You Learn Program*

The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that are equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.The Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies and needs, converting an Individual into a market-ready professional. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
29/01/24, 2:27 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Projects with Brands and Companies: -*
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, such as:
*Africa Global Radio-* The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project and hear from the CEO about the exposures of the Edoofa program.

*Skooqs-* This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

*Recruitment Partners:-*
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

*Webinars:-*
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars regularly with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
-Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
-How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi
-How to be industry-ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu
-It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje
-Decoding the science of personal branding by Mr, Simon Maingi
29/01/24, 2:27 pm - Pallika Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field. These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.

*What are your views on the same? Do you think you will be benefiting from the Earn While You Learn Program?*
29/01/24, 2:45 pm - +263 77 878 3230: Yes I think we will be benefiting a lot firstly our financial problems and he program of EWYL..secondly the standards and quality of education  .i think all the the facts are promising a good turn out
29/01/24, 2:47 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/01/24, 2:47 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Absolutely,
If I have to help you explain how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable compared to Local Universities, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now, if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, bringing the cost further down to $1000 per year including the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month. *This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*

*You can see this even in this scholarship credit certificate where one of our star performers, our Proud Edoodians  Masinire Miriam earned $1965 within a year.* I hope you can now realize the power of the EWYL program to reduce the financial pressure on families.
29/01/24, 2:56 pm - +263 77 878 3230: Ok I can see ..So may I ask how the students fixes the time of learning and working hours .I mean how is that scheduled
29/01/24, 2:59 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Ms. Claris, Please note that the EWYL projects are online. In India, international student isn't permitted to do part-time to ensure they focus on education completely. The same is ensured in the Earn While You Learn Program. Just imagine, you having a physical job. You have to travel from your residence and prepare your routine accordingly which would affect your study hours, especially during exams. Now, the Earn While You Lear Program offers projects that are online which you can perform at your residence itself with flexibility in working hours which allows a complete balance between the program and education!
29/01/24, 3:29 pm - +263 77 878 3230: It's alright . I understand
29/01/24, 3:30 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Great, Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, a few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :

*1. Expert Career Counselling:* We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counsellors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.

*2. Affordability through guaranteed scholarships:* Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off.

*3. Earn While You Learn:* The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing our students for the real world. 

*4.Higher Education Concierge:* A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.*

29/01/24, 4:12 pm - +263 77 878 3230: I think the 4th one is the most significant
