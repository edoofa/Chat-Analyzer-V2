22/12/23, 1:05 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Thank you for sharing this, I want to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*



Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it
22/12/23, 1:05 pm - Pallika Edoofa: And, As your evaluation progresses, I would like to appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country. In this process did you do any prior research on foreign education or apply to any University abroad?
22/12/23, 1:10 pm - +263 78 623 8811: Yes Iam
22/12/23, 1:11 pm - +263 78 623 8811: No i just searched for  names of universities abroad
22/12/23, 1:13 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
22/12/23, 1:15 pm - +263 78 623 8811: Ok thank you for sharing
22/12/23, 1:41 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Anotida, Based on my evaluation, considering your subjects, interests, and passion, you are eligible to pursue

*Required Skill-Set for BA LLB*

23/12/23, 10:49 am - Pallika Edoofa: Well, I am sure after seeing all these amazing facts, you are intrigued to study in India. So can you now tell me, How would studying in India have a positive impact on your career and How do you aim to achieve your career aspirations from studying in India?
23/12/23, 11:23 am - +263 78 623 8811: Thank you for sharing the information
23/12/23, 11:23 am - +263 78 623 8811: It will have a positive since i will be learning with different types of people and be exposed to different types of societies which will help me after 5 years since i will be interacting with a lot of people
23/12/23, 11:23 am - +263 78 623 8811: I'm aiming to study hard so that i can achieve my goal in India which is the best place for that
23/12/23, 11:24 am - Pallika Edoofa: Anotida, 
I see that you understand the quality of higher education that Edoofa seeks to deliver to its students so that after completing their education, the students can achieve their career goals and have a prosperous career ahead of them.

So, are you or any of your family members aware of the expense of a comparable quality higher education for an international student without a scholarship in India?
23/12/23, 11:28 am - +263 78 623 8811: No
23/12/23, 11:29 am - Pallika Edoofa: That's alright, Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth!
In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc., it is still beyond the reach of many.
With the Edoofa Scholarship Program, the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Laundry, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
23/12/23, 11:29 am - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/12/23, 11:29 am - Pallika Edoofa: However, as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, simply after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.




*So looking at these reduced fees do you feel it is affordable to your family?*
23/12/23, 11:39 am - +263 78 623 8811: Yess
23/12/23, 11:46 am - Pallika Edoofa: Good to hear that!!


So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians. Looking at this cost of education, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits which can help you in reducing their fees further.


And do you know how that is done?
23/12/23, 11:47 am - +263 78 623 8811: That's great 
No how is it done
23/12/23, 11:49 am - Pallika Edoofa: That's alright, Let me tell you how Edoofa helps students bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the


*Earn While You Learn Program*


The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
23/12/23, 11:49 am - Pallika Edoofa: Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.


*The EWYL Program*, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
23/12/23, 11:49 am - Pallika Edoofa: *The EWYL Program* has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
23/12/23, 11:49 am - Pallika Edoofa: *Projects with Brands and Companies: -*
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, The following are:
Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

23/12/23, 11:49 am - Pallika Edoofa: *Recruitment Partners: -*
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics
23/12/23, 11:49 am - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/12/23, 11:49 am - Pallika Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.
23/12/23, 11:49 am - Pallika Edoofa: *What are your views on the same? Do you think you will benefit from the Earn While You Learn Program?*
23/12/23, 12:02 pm - +263 78 623 8811: It is a very good program which can help the student 
Yes i will benefit
23/12/23, 12:05 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Indeed


If I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.


*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly*.
23/12/23, 12:08 pm - +263 78 623 8811: Olk it is a good program
23/12/23, 12:09 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Indeed!
23/12/23, 12:09 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Now, As we are proceeding towards the end of the session, let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to is different from other scholarship programs, A few facts that you must have noticed during our counseling:
1. *Expert Career Counseling*: We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced, and empathetic career counselors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.

2. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save up to $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off

3. *Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What's more, students earn

*4.*Higher Education Concierge*: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education*.

After going through the facts that make Edoofa different, 
Let me know which point out of the 4  you like the most.
23/12/23, 12:22 pm - +263 78 623 8811: 1. Expert Career Counseling
23/12/23, 12:26 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Great! 
So now I know you focus more on Expert Career Counseling

Let me also show you some monthly earnings of students through Earn While You Learn.

23/12/23, 12:26 pm - Pallika Edoofa: There is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it depends upon his/her hard work. However may I know, who will be helping you with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
23/12/23, 12:29 pm - +263 78 623 8811: Olk
23/12/23, 12:29 pm - Pallika Edoofa: please address this
23/12/23, 12:30 pm - +263 78 623 8811: My father
23/12/23, 12:30 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's completely understandable,
So, I believe you'll be discussing everything with them after we complete today's session. Also after our counseling session, I would connect to some of our Beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know the proceedings well.

So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
23/12/23, 12:32 pm - +263 78 623 8811: Yes i will
23/12/23, 12:35 pm - +263 78 623 8811: They happy and excited about it
23/12/23, 12:35 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Anotida, I am glad to hear that, as studying Internationally would make your career advance at an even greater pace, as you will be transformed into a professional with a Greater Paying Job, which would actually help you in uplifting your family there by yourself, and provide a peaceful and hassle-free life to your parents.
23/12/23, 12:35 pm - Pallika Edoofa: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be 

1) *Application Form*

2) *Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

3) *Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university

Isn't it?
23/12/23, 12:37 pm - +263 78 623 8811: Yes
23/12/23, 12:39 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Indeed
When a student applies alone for an international University, on average the application fee of a University is *$150-$200*. Statement of Purpose of the students costs between *$120-$150* respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it.

Now this basically means, that for a student to apply to just *5 Universities the average cost* incurred by him/her would be somewhere between *$1350-1750* *(Application Form + Statement of Purpose) without* even receiving a guarantee to be selected for not
23/12/23, 12:39 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Do you know this is one reason that Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurance of what would happen, just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.

So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create *the statement of purpose but also helps you with the Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection, sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than *$1350-$1750* without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only *$750*. *This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.*
23/12/23, 12:40 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/12/23, 12:40 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I hope you understand now. So, Shall I explain to you when and why the enrollment fee is paid?
23/12/23, 12:48 pm - +263 78 623 8811: Yes you can
23/12/23, 12:48 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright!
23/12/23, 12:49 pm - Pallika Edoofa: This enrollment fee is to be paid only if a student qualifies for the Edoofa program and includes your
*-Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
*-Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
*-Earn While You Learn Program and training*
*-University sessions and interactions*
*-A guaranteed scholarship seat*
*-Visa Documentation Assistance*
*The Foster and Care throughout your course*
23/12/23, 12:49 pm - Pallika Edoofa: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is *found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
23/12/23, 12:49 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Basically, there are 3 phases of the enrollment process.


*Phase 1*: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation
If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.


*Phase 2*: Once the students complete Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-level result is out).


*Phase 3*: Once the final A-level results are out if the student has passed the necessary requirements as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission will be continued. However, if the student doesn't meet the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the $350 would be refunded to the parents.


*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.*
23/12/23, 12:56 pm - +263 78 623 8811: Ok thank you for sharing the information
23/12/23, 12:57 pm - Pallika Edoofa: You are welcome
23/12/23, 12:58 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/12/23, 1:02 pm - +263 78 623 8811: Stage 2
23/12/23, 1:05 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Well,
We are at stage one but have also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which are stage 4.

*In Step 1: Connect with a counselor*- As your counselor, we are going through the counseling process, discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

*In Step 2: Eligibility Check*- The eligibility check includes the interviews with the Academic Board and the Test.

*Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa*- If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

*Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program*- This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.


We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
23/12/23, 1:09 pm - +263 78 623 8811: Ok yes you can explain
23/12/23, 1:11 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 5*: After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities.



*August 2025 intake, applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.*



This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.
23/12/23, 1:11 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 6:* Once you are done with the registration fee payment, you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.
 
I hope you are clear with the process.
23/12/23, 1:14 pm - +263 78 623 8811: Yes it is clear

I hope you're well. I've been anticipating your feedback after you reviewed the letter from the Program Director. Your response is crucial, as it represents your support for this unique opportunity, which will provide your child with affordable, quality higher education and valuable employability skills.

02/01/24, 8:29 pm - +263 77 366 1477: <Media omitted>
02/01/24, 8:31 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Sure, Mr. Iyati, If we begin the eligibility check stage of your child today, it would be of 1-2 days after which the results will be out which means if your child qualifies for the Edoofa Scholarship, the due date for the first part of the enrollment fee ($200)will fall on the next week of January. Are you confident and comfortable with the timeframe?
02/01/24, 8:40 pm - +263 77 366 1477: I might be or not but will have to hear from the parents side if they are comfortable with that. At least your respond makes it clear to them that within this month of January a payment of 200 will be required
02/01/24, 8:41 pm - +263 77 366 1477: It's only a network problem that they have, they should have responded

26/01/24, 6:27 am - +263 78 623 8811: Hello Ms Pallika
29/01/24, 11:15 am - Pallika Edoofa: Greetings Everyone,
I hope that you are doing well today!

Kindly excuse the delay as we were celebrating Republic Day, 26th January, and we commemorate the remarkable journey of our nation This celebration has granted us a holiday, extending into a long weekend as well!
29/01/24, 11:17 am - Pallika Edoofa: Thank you for sharing this Dear Parent, If we begin the eligibility check stage of your child today, it would be of 1-2 days after which the results will be out which means if your child qualifies for the Edoofa Scholarship, the due date for the first part of the enrollment fee ($200)will fall on the First week of February. Are you confident and comfortable with the timeframe?
29/01/24, 4:57 pm - +263 78 623 8811: Hello Ms Pallika 
Yes we are ok
29/01/24, 8:42 pm - Pallika Edoofa: May I know if you are comfortable with this plan, please?
29/01/24, 9:06 pm - +263 77 588 7689: Yes Iam
29/01/24, 9:07 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Thank you for the acknowledgement, dear parent!
It has been duly noted and we appreciate your support for your child's career
29/01/24, 9:07 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Anotida, The most important process of your eligibility check stage is your scholarship interview with the Program Director at Edoofa. Shall I share the schedule for the same?
29/01/24, 9:12 pm - +263 78 623 8811: Yes
29/01/24, 9:12 pm - +263 78 623 8811: I'm now going to school so during the day i might not be able to answer you
29/01/24, 9:13 pm - Pallika Edoofa: May I know when you will be available then?
29/01/24, 9:16 pm - +263 78 623 8811: 16:30 or 17:00
29/01/24, 9:17 pm - Pallika Edoofa: In that case, As you know, A-level students are currently occupied with lessons and exam preparations due to which they are unavailable now. When you compare this with the Western African Countries students will be available with results much earlier than Zimbabweans, and there is a high chance that the scholarship seats would be occupied by them which in turn would be a loss for Zimbabwean students. At the same time, the day scholars in Zimbabwe are still applying and clearing the tests. 

All these factors have been a disadvantage for the boarding students and specifically the students who aren't supposed to use their devices in School. By the time they are back, the opportunity might be vacated by other applicants. This is the reason why our Academic Board along with the discussion with Universities has decided to allow parents to take part in the seat reservation interview for their children so that no deserving applicant is missed out.
29/01/24, 9:17 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *So your parents willing to take up the Seat Reservation Interview call for you?*
29/01/24, 9:27 pm - +263 78 623 8811: Ohh ok that's good
29/01/24, 9:27 pm - +263 78 623 8811: First when will the interview call take place
29/01/24, 9:27 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I will schedule that tomorrow for you.
29/01/24, 9:41 pm - +263 78 623 8811: At what time because they might be at work
30/01/24, 9:08 am - Pallika Edoofa: So, I would like to know a convenient time so that we can schedule a reservation call for you and reserve a seat as you see A level results are out students are willing to pursue our program and there are a limited number of seats, to have your reservation your parents can make a little effort
30/01/24, 4:47 pm - +263 78 623 8811: 18:30will be ok
