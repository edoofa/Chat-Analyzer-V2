09/01/24, 3:03 pm - +263 77 274 3326: For educational aqualification she has currently wrote and passed the Zimbabwean Zimsec Grade 7 and Cambridge O' level Examinations. She is currently waiting for her Cambridge  AS Examinations Results. Currently she is in year final of high School where she is studying  Economics, Business Studies and Geography.  In terms of school ability Nicole is an above average student, who when given the correct Environment she excels. I found her to be committed and focused to her work. 2. She aspires to study Aviation Management so programs like a BSC in Airline and Airport Management and programs of a similar Nature are her desires of study.  Her Motivation is that she sees this as a challenging career whereby very few women have ventured into it and she wants to partake in changing that scenario. She is also member of the Flight Wing and Aviation Club, this has exposed her and built her interest towards the field of Aviation. Also the fact that Africa is lagging behind when it comes to Aviations Systems and Products means there is great opportunity to uplift Africa in this this regard. 3. Her hobbies are baking and playing sports like Swimming, Rugby and Dancing. HER interests are in assisting the less Privilege like in our Area we have a HOME that looks after ophaned and disadvantagee Children. She sometimes finds time to be with the kids. She also sometimes saves her pocket money to buy small goodies like sweets and fruits for the kids. She also has interests in Aviation aeroplanes probably more so because our house is close to the airport  she also likes taking care of pets like dogs. 4. We are a family of 6, children we have 2 girls and 2 boys (the other boy is a Cousin brother and we are currently staying with him) the boys are doing grade 6 and 7. Nicole is the first born she will be turning 18 on 26 January 2024 and she also has a sister Raphaela who is doing form 4 at the same shool with Nicole. 5. Nicole did her O'level at St John's High School and she is currently doing her A' level at Dominican Convent High School in Harare 6. Currently the termly schools is 2600.00USD and it has been paid by us her parents about 40% of this amount is coming from our work place.

On this positive note, are we good to begin today's session?

10/01/24, 9:22 am - Pallika Edoofa: I am also doing well by God's grace
10/01/24, 9:22 am - Pallika Edoofa: Thank you for sharing these.
10/01/24, 9:22 am - Pallika Edoofa: Let me brief you that, I want to brief you that the criteria before the pandemic was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is *a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.
10/01/24, 9:22 am - Pallika Edoofa: And, As your evaluation progresses, I appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country.

It's essential to recognize that aspiring to become a pilot usually involves enrolling in an aviation school equipped with the required infrastructure.

*By any chance are you familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship?*
12/01/24, 8:48 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
12/01/24, 11:20 pm - +263 77 274 3326: What will happen after the study? Does India offer employment opportunities? What is the Indian policy on Citizenship?
13/01/24, 9:21 am - Pallika Edoofa: Greetings Everyone,

13/01/24, 2:13 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
13/01/24, 2:14 pm - +263 77 274 3326: Countries differ its so difficult to compare. In Germany Tertiary education is almost free, Russia is equally on the lower side so is Poland.  Whilist Countries like Australia and UK are on the higher side.
15/01/24, 1:04 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Greeting Everyone,
How are you doing today?

Kindly excuse the delay as I was occupied in the overwhelming number of applicants after the A-level results in Zimbabwe and their evaluation, 

So, Shall we begin with the session?
15/01/24, 4:47 pm - +263 77 274 3326: Yes it's fine
15/01/24, 4:47 pm - Pallika Edoofa: How are you doing today, Mr. Lukas?
15/01/24, 4:54 pm - +263 77 274 3326: I am fine how are you
15/01/24, 4:57 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's alright, Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India compared to other global hubs.

In India, international students face an average expense of *$6000-$8000 annually.* While this is very low as compared to the Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc where the cost of education ranges from $15000-$35000 annually, it is still beyond the reach of many.

With the Edoofa Scholarship Program, the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000 per annum* for the students who are found eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility Check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Laundry, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
15/01/24, 4:57 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
15/01/24, 5:11 pm - +263 77 274 3326: Yes it is affordable
15/01/24, 5:13 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Good to know, 
So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians. Looking at this cost of education as well, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits which can help in reducing their fees further.

Do you know how that is done?
15/01/24, 5:26 pm - +263 77 274 3326: No
15/01/24, 5:27 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That’s alright, Let me tell you how Edoofa helps Edoofians bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the *Earn While You Learn Program*

The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that are equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.The Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies and needs, converting an Individual into a market-ready professional. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
15/01/24, 5:28 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Projects with Brands and Companies: -*
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, such as:
*Africa Global Radio-* The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project and hear from the CEO about the exposures of the Edoofa program.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4DAP24ZuY4&authuser=0
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0
*Skooqs-* This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

*Recruitment Partners:-*
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

*Webinars:-*
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars regularly with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
-Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
-How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi
-How to be industry-ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu
-It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje
-Decoding the science of personal branding by Mr, Simon Maingi
15/01/24, 5:29 pm - Pallika Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field. These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.

*What are your views on the same? Do you think Nicole will be benefiting from the Earn While You Learn Program?*
15/01/24, 5:32 pm - +263 77 274 3326: Yes she can benefit so much
15/01/24, 5:33 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
15/01/24, 5:35 pm - +263 77 274 3326: Yes indeed
15/01/24, 5:38 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's Great , Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, a few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :

*1. Expert Career Counselling:* We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counsellors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.

*2. Affordability through guaranteed scholarships:* Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off.

*3. Earn While You Learn:* The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing our students for the real world. 

*4.Higher Education Concierge:* A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.*

After going through these facts that make Edoofa different, which one out of the 4 did you feel is the most significant?
15/01/24, 5:42 pm - +263 77 274 3326: Great
15/01/24, 5:44 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Please let me know this
15/01/24, 5:46 pm - +263 77 274 3326: All these are important
15/01/24, 5:50 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Great! 
So now I know you have grabbed the whole program very well

15/01/24, 5:51 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
15/01/24, 5:51 pm - Pallika Edoofa: As you see, there is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it depends upon his/her hard work.
15/01/24, 5:52 pm - +263 77 274 3326: Are these students allowed to work in India aftee school?
15/01/24, 5:54 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Yes, international students are generally allowed to work in India after completing their studies. The specifics may vary, but many universities have provisions for post-study work permits or internships to provide valuable practical experience. It's a great opportunity to gain hands-on experience and further enhance your career prospects!
15/01/24, 5:54 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Also,  I believe you'll be discussing everything with your family after we complete today's session. Also, after our counselling session, I would connect to some of our beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know their experiences and proceedings well.

May I know how you feel about your child studying abroad?
15/01/24, 6:02 pm - +263 77 274 3326: It will be a good opportunity and very good
15/01/24, 6:05 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, studying Internationally would make your child’s career advance at an even greater pace, as your child will be transformed into a professional with a Greater Paying Job, which would help in uplifting your family and provide a hassle-free life.
15/01/24, 6:05 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *As we move to the last part of the session, let me highlight a few requirements while a student applies alone* 

*1) Application Form* -An online or offline form that asks for your personal details and academic background.

*2) Statement of Purpose-* An essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and your aspirations for your career.

*3) Letter of Recommendation-* from Senior authorities, School Heads or others on why they recommend you to be a right fit for an international university.
Do you know about other requirements?
15/01/24, 6:10 pm - +263 77 274 3326: Maybe her results when there are out
15/01/24, 6:25 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Absolutely, When a student applies alone for an international University, on average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose costs between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally and act as a major parameter to decide the child’s eligibility. If you apply to 5 Universities, the average costs for the mentioned would be $1350-$1750, *without even receiving a guarantee to be selected*

*Edoofa has identified a solution for this uncertainty and unaffordability.* If a student qualifies after the eligibility check, not only does Edoofa help them draft their statement of purpose but also helps in terms of Visa Documentation Assistance, University Session and selection, Individual mentorship, etc, reducing the costs significantly to $750 which is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
15/01/24, 6:25 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
15/01/24, 6:27 pm - +263 77 274 3326: Okay
15/01/24, 6:27 pm - Pallika Edoofa: There are 3 phases to the enrollment process.
 
*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation
If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Acceptance Letter. You are supposed to pay the enrollment fee of $350 in 7 days for the scholarship seat reservation and to begin the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2*: Once the students complete Phase 1 they will be starting the Earn While You Learn program session(Each student will have an opportunity to earn scholarship credits that can be used to reduce their fee even before their A-Level result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final A-level results are out and the student has passed the requirement as per Edoofa, then their final university evaluation and Admission will continue. However, if the student wouldn’t meet the requirements as per the university and Edoofa, then the $350 will be refunded to the parent.

The amount of credits earned by the student in phase 2 can be used for the first year’s annual fee itself so that parents are relieved from financial stress paving the way for proper financial planning for higher education.
15/01/24, 6:27 pm - Pallika Edoofa: The enrollment fee is to be paid only if a child is found eligible for the Edoofa Scholarship Program after passing the eligibility check stage, it includes, 

*Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
*Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
*Earn While You Learn Program and training*
*University sessions and selection*
*A guaranteed scholarship seat*
*Visa Documentation Assistance*
*The Foster and Care throughout the course of an Edoofian*
15/01/24, 6:27 pm - Pallika Edoofa: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge due to which parents might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short period of 7 days and for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option wherein if the student is found eligible, instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, *parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days thereby reducing the financial pressure.*
15/01/24, 6:34 pm - +263 77 274 3326: Okay
15/01/24, 6:35 pm - +263 77 274 3326: But may I have the entry qualification for various Universities in India so that we are well informed on other available programs
15/01/24, 7:32 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Kindly not that the prerequisites differ among universities and courses. Considering we offer a vast range of 240+ courses, providing comprehensive details for each is challenging. However, we meticulously assess aspirations, subjects, and academic background to guide students towards the most fitting domain that aligns with their career goals. If you have inquiries about other domains, please feel free to ask. <This message was edited>
15/01/24, 7:37 pm - +263 77 274 3326: A degree in Computer Science what are the requirements

So, kindly address this
16/01/24, 6:27 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
16/01/24, 10:46 pm - +263 77 274 3326: Stage 04
17/01/24, 9:13 am - Pallika Edoofa: Greetings!

*Success is a journey, not a destination.*

On this positive note, shall we begin with your session?
17/01/24, 9:23 am - +263 77 274 3326: Its fine
17/01/24, 9:24 am - Pallika Edoofa: Well Mr. Lukas,
We also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.

*Step 1:Connect with a counsellor-* As your counsellor, now we are going through the counselling process discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Edoofa Scholarship.                        

*Step 2:Eligibility Check-* The eligibility check includes the interviews with the Academic Board and Scholarship Test.

*Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa-* If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter.

*Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program-* This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.

We are left with steps 5 and 6.
So shall I explain them to you?
17/01/24, 10:13 am - +263 77 519 8084: Yes please go ahead
17/01/24, 10:29 am - Pallika Edoofa: Sure!
17/01/24, 10:30 am - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 5:* After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors. They will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. will be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by paying the registration fee within a few weeks.

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education and the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments.

17/01/24, 10:58 am - +263 77 519 8084: Yes its clear
17/01/24, 11:26 am - Pallika Edoofa: Do you have any questions for me now?
17/01/24, 2:49 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Are we connected, Ms. Mkucha? <This message was edited>
17/01/24, 3:20 pm - +263 77 519 8084: No, we don't have any questions. Sorry for the delay.
17/01/24, 3:24 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright!
17/01/24, 3:25 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Dear Parent, we have come to the end of your counselling session. Before I guide you Step 2 of the Eligibility Check, I want you to have a full-fledged discussion of the Edoofa program within your family as higher education is supposed to be a family decision. Ensure to include these aspects during the discussions:-

*About the EDOOFA Program and its vision of making Education Affordable and Edoofians Employment Ready.*
*Value of the career of an Edoofian after pursuing higher education in India.*
*The financial aspects and how Edoofa brings in affordability and self-financing opportunities for students.*
17/01/24, 3:25 pm - Pallika Edoofa: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences,

*Edoofa’s Website- www.edoofa.com* 
*Pictures (Edoofians from Africa studying in India): https://tinyurl.com/3ke35s35*

*Please ensure to go through the FAQ document before the next stage and refer the same to your family as it has answers to most of the queries.* Furthermore, if you have any other queries I would suggest that you note them down and we will discuss them in the next session.

Let me also share a few pictures of the students who are studying in India through the Edoofa Program so that you can witness the exposures and their experiences.

17/01/24, 3:31 pm - +263 77 519 8084: Thank you for the presentations and yr time, we really appreciate.
17/01/24, 3:31 pm - Pallika Edoofa: You are most Welcome!
17/01/24, 3:31 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Have a great day ahead!
17/01/24, 3:31 pm - +263 77 519 8084: Same to you
18/01/24, 10:33 am - Pallika Edoofa: Greetings Nicole, Mr. Lukas, and Ms. Mkucha,

Congratulations on clearing stage 1 of the Edoofa Program I hope you have learned about the program better through the previous sessions. Now, I will guide you to the most important *Eligibility check stage* after addressing your questions. 

Are you ready for the same?
18/01/24, 1:25 pm - +263 77 519 8084: Good afternoon, thank you for the 1st session. We are ready.
18/01/24, 1:30 pm - Pallika Edoofa: It is good to connect with you today, Mr. Mkucha,
I hope you are doing well
18/01/24, 1:30 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I believe you have been following the sessions on the group regarding the program. What are your thoughts on the Edoofa Scholarship Program and do you have any questions for me, please?
18/01/24, 1:32 pm - +263 77 519 8084: Thank you. On what we have covered so far all was clear no questions.
18/01/24, 1:33 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I am glad you understand this opportunity's importance and the power to transform your child's career!


May I know your thoughts regarding the financial aspects such as enrollment fees and cost of education, please
18/01/24, 1:38 pm - +263 77 519 8084: I think they are manageable especially if we start preparations early
18/01/24, 1:39 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's right!

I appreciate your willingness to invest in your child’s career
18/01/24, 1:39 pm - Pallika Edoofa: May I know if Nicole is available?
18/01/24, 1:40 pm - +263 77 519 8084: She's at school now, will only be available after 4.30 Zim time.
18/01/24, 1:41 pm - Pallika Edoofa: As you know, A-level students are currently occupied with lessons and exam preparations due to which they are unavailable now. When you compare this with the Western African Countries students will be available with results much earlier than Zimbabweans, and there is a high chance that the scholarship seats would be occupied by them which in turn would be a loss for Zimbabwean students. At the same time, the day scholars in Zimbabwe are still applying and clearing the tests. 

All these factors have been a disadvantage for the boarding students and specifically the students who aren't supposed to use their devices in School. By the time they are back, the opportunity might be vacated by other applicants. This is the reason why our Academic Board along with the discussion with Universities has decided to allow parents to take part in the seat reservation interview for their children so that no deserving applicant is missed out. 

*So are you willing to take up the Seat Reservation Interview call for Nicole?*
18/01/24, 1:43 pm - +263 77 519 8084: Yes we are willing
18/01/24, 1:46 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Will be available at 03:00 PM today for the seat reservation call?
18/01/24, 3:13 pm - +263 77 274 3326: Let's do it tomorrow
18/01/24, 4:03 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright!
18/01/24, 4:04 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Mr. Lukas, Will be available at 03:00 PM Tomorrow for the seat reservation call?
18/01/24, 4:51 pm - +263 77 274 3326: I hope so will try to be there
18/01/24, 4:54 pm - Pallika Edoofa: May I know at what time you will be available?
18/01/24, 7:58 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Mr. Lukas, Are we connected?
18/01/24, 8:08 pm - +263 77 274 3326: Let's connect at 1330hours

18/01/24, 8:11 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I appreciate your willingness to participate in your child’s career!
So, Before scheduling a seat reservation call, Can you tell me?

1. What is the name of the course that your child would be studying through the Edoofa Program?

2. In which country will he be studying through the Edoofa program?

3. What is the average cost of studies in India without a scholarship?

4. What is the annual fee you will pay if your child is found eligible for the program?

5. After receiving the offer letter from the University, you will have to pay the registration fee in order to finalize your child’s university selection and reserve the scholarship seat in a particular university, this registration fee will be adjusted in the first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of the first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same? <This message was edited>

Since the results were shared over email, you are supposed to acknowledge them as well.
As you have gone through the Letter of Acceptance properly, may I know if you would like to ask anything?
25/01/24, 9:27 am - Pallika Edoofa: For your convenience, let me share the Letter of Acceptance for Blessing over here as well so that you can go through it and let me know.

I hope that you have gone through the letter thoroughly!

25/01/24, 12:30 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's alright, please go through once and let me know once done!
29/01/24, 1:56 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Good afternoon Mr. Lukas.
29/01/24, 1:56 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I have been expecting to hear from you since Thursday, may I know what happened?
30/01/24, 8:27 am - +263 77 274 3326: Kindly clarify on the 1000usd registration fee. Also this earn while you learn - which kind of work will the students engaged in?
30/01/24, 8:28 am - +263 77 274 3326: The degree program is just 3 years is this an Honours or just a General degree
30/01/24, 8:29 am - +263 77 274 3326: You spoke of the Edoofa Campus is this for just residential? Do Indian Universities not offer Accomodation?
30/01/24, 8:41 am - Pallika Edoofa: Let me help you out over here!
30/01/24, 8:49 am - Pallika Edoofa: Mr. Lukas, as you know in the Stage 5 of the Edoofa Cycle, a student receives multiple offer letters out of which they have to finalize one university for their admission, therefore, let me help you understand how this registration fee works.

Say suppose, after the scholarship your fee is $2200, and you are being asked to pay $1000 as a registration fee.

Now, being an Edoofa Applicant you have the privilege here of the registration fee being adjusted against your Tuition fee.

Hence the amount of $1000 paid as registration fee will be waived off from your Fee and after that, the balance of ($2200-$1000=$1200) has to be paid after coming to India in August/September of the year you come in 2 installments. The first part will be $600 which you will pay in August 2024-2025 and the remaining $600 in January 2025-2026.
30/01/24, 8:50 am - Pallika Edoofa: I hope you are now clear about it?
30/01/24, 10:59 am - +263 77 274 3326: [30/01, 08:28] Sir L.T: The degree program is just 3 years is this an Honours or just a General degree
[30/01, 08:29] Sir L.T: You spoke of the Edoofa Campus is this for just residential? Do Indian Universities not offer Accomodation?
30/01/24, 11:00 am - +263 77 274 3326: Kindly also address these issues
30/01/24, 11:11 am - Pallika Edoofa: It is an Honors course please!
