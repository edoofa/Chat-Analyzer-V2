I will be waiting!
29/01/24, 11:20 am - +263 77 210 1377: Thank you
29/01/24, 8:58 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/01/24, 9:21 pm - +263 77 210 1377: Am really sorry for not responding as promised. Got tied up but will be available tomorrow.
30/01/24, 9:32 am - Pallika Edoofa: Greetings,

*"With a dream, comes the potential for achievement."*

On this positive note, are we good to begin today's session?
30/01/24, 9:40 am - +263 77 210 1377: Greetings.Yes we can proceed.

Yesterday we had an opportunity to engage Jonathan's A Level teacher and he was of the opinion that Jonathan undertakes a degree in Computer Science purely and then specialize as he goes up the academic ladder.
30/01/24, 10:02 am - Pallika Edoofa: I am glad to hear that!
30/01/24, 10:02 am - Pallika Edoofa: So, are you willing to pursue with this course?
30/01/24, 10:07 am - +263 77 210 1377: No, not willing to pursue this one but Computer Science
30/01/24, 10:14 am - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Thank you for sharing the teacher's recommendation. While pursuing a BSc in Computer Science is definitely an option, I'd like to offer an alternative perspective as a counselor. Opting for a Bachelor of Computer Applications (BCA) degree also holds significant advantages. BCA provides a strong foundation in computer science along with specialized training in practical applications, which can lead to quicker entry into the workforce. Additionally, BCA programs often emphasize industry-relevant skills, offer opportunities for hands-on learning, and provide a pathway to internships for gaining real-world experience.
30/01/24, 10:23 am - +263 77 210 1377: Yes I get what you are saying and appreciate your advice.We may therefore need a little bit of time to research before making a final decision.
30/01/24, 10:27 am - Pallika Edoofa: Sure, You can research for the same.
30/01/24, 10:27 am - Pallika Edoofa: Please note Bachelor of Computer Applications (BCA) over a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (BSc CS) can offer numerous advantages aligned with one's career aspirations. BCA programs typically provide a more specialized and practical approach to computer science education, focusing on the application of theoretical concepts in real-world scenarios. This emphasis on practical skills equips students with a hands-on understanding of software development, database management, and other key areas crucial in today's tech-driven job market. Additionally, BCA curricula often integrate industry-relevant projects and internships, offering students valuable exposure to the professional landscape and networking opportunities. As such, opting for a BCA degree can be advantageous for individuals seeking a more direct path to fulfilling their career goals in the field of computer science.
30/01/24, 10:38 am - +263 77 210 1377: Noted.Will definitely come back to you in shortest possible time.
30/01/24, 10:46 am - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, I will be waiting!
30/01/24, 10:46 am - +263 77 210 1377: Thank you
