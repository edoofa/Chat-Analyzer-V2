What did you learn about the Edoofa Program after interacting with a student beneficiary of the Edoofa Scholarship?
This is a program which offers students and opportunity to do their tertiary level in India and makes it very affordable for them. I understand it's an opportunity to grow, learn and equip oneself with essential skills to get employment.


Why should you be accepted into the Edoofa Program (20-40 Words)?
I want to serve my purpose in this world. I believe my purpose is to help others and make other people's life easier to live. To me Edoofa will be like a bridge to help me get the knowledge and skills to allow me to serve my purpose. I believe if I get this opportunity it's not something to waste but make good use of it because many students are yearning for this but they are just unfortunate to comw across such wonderful programs like EDOOFA
