24/01/24, 9:45 am - Pallika Edoofa: How are you doing today?
24/01/24, 9:45 am - +263 77 254 1679: I'm doing well thanks
24/01/24, 4:14 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
25/01/24, 9:55 am - Pallika Edoofa: Greeting Everyone,
How are you all doing today?
25/01/24, 10:23 am - +263 77 254 1679: Greetings. I am alright thanks
25/01/24, 10:26 am - Pallika Edoofa: Glad to know that!
25/01/24, 10:27 am - Pallika Edoofa: Kindly excuse for yesterday, please!
25/01/24, 10:35 am - +263 77 254 1679: Ok thanks
25/01/24, 10:54 am - Pallika Edoofa: Mrs. Katiyo, Continuing the discussion, Please note that the Edoofa Scholarship offers 50-100% scholarship on the tuition fees and based on the performance and evaluations of our Academic Board, one can even achieve a higher quantum of the scholarship but the remaining cost after the scholarship such as Living and Transportation is catered by a student's family.  I will be guiding you through the financial aspects of the program.

Will you as a Family be able to manage the remaining expenses?
25/01/24, 10:57 am - +263 77 254 1679: Greetings once again. Foe the expenses it's difficult to meet them since both Evans parents are just peasant farmers without employment. It would be difficult to meet financial expenses for him.
25/01/24, 11:31 am - Pallika Edoofa: I understand, Mrs. Katiyo. Please take into consideration that once Evans becomes eligible, he can participate in the "Earn While You Learn" program. This initiative enables students to self-finance their education, thereby reducing the financial burden on their parents. By earning $50-100 a month through this program, Evans can contribute towards lowering his tuition fees.
25/01/24, 11:32 am - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
25/01/24, 11:42 am - +263 77 254 1679: This is actually a good initiative. We appreciate it.
25/01/24, 12:01 pm - Pallika Edoofa: So, Do you think you will be able to manage?
25/01/24, 2:37 pm - +263 77 254 1679: I suggest he will do the Earn while you learn program. It's good that way
25/01/24, 4:14 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for the delay as I was having my lunch!
25/01/24, 4:14 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright!

30/01/24, 12:05 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright Evans
30/01/24, 12:05 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Considering your interests, Let me tell you that we do not offer Actuarial science as a course, while Actuarial Science is indeed an independent and specialized degree program, there are certain aspects to consider that make a Bachelor of Commerce (BCom) a favorable alternative for students
While Actuarial Science is a field with a unique focus on risk management and financial security, the comprehensive nature of a BCom degree can offer a strong foundation for a successful and diverse career in various other sectors including risk management and financial security.
30/01/24, 12:06 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Shall I explain the course depth to you?
30/01/24, 12:07 pm - +263 78 076 9299: Okay...you can go ahead
30/01/24, 12:07 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Sure
30/01/24, 12:07 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Let me explain BCOM in depth to you, please!
30/01/24, 12:08 pm - +263 78 076 9299: Okay  ..fine thank you
30/01/24, 12:08 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Bachelor of Commerce (B.com)* is a three year long undergraduate course that is evenly distributed into 6 half-yearly semesters. 

A high number of jobs are available for B.com graduates in industries such as Information Technology, Manufacturing, Telecommunications and Banking.The most sought after B.Com. jobs are Financial Manger, Accountant, Lecturer, Chartered Accountant, Human Resource Development etc.

The 3 year B.com degree program aims to facilitate a deep understanding of how business organizations work. It develops knowledge and skills in core B.com subjects like Accounting, Finance, Banking & Insurance, Marketing, Human Resources and Taxation.
The entire B.com syllabus is designed in a manner which develops competency in students, allowing them to pursue higher level programs. It also increases practical knowledge and employability.

*Accountancy*
*Cost Account*
*Statistics*

*B.Com graduates can pursue post-graduation courses such as M.Com (Master of Commerce), MBA (Master of Business Administration), CA (Chartered Accountant), CS (Company Secretary), Actuarial Scientist, and ACCA (Association of Chartered Accountants).*

*B.Com graduates have a plethora of job positions in government as well as private sectors to choose from provided that they are not limited to careers in accounts and finance*
30/01/24, 12:17 pm - +263 78 076 9299: Okay ...i understand but cant i specialise in a certain trade like telecommunications  and banking .According to your explanation  im getting you from this angle, B.com is covering a wide array of courses ounder it ...
30/01/24, 12:19 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Absolutely, I understand your desire to specialize, and it's a great consideration. However, pursuing a Bachelor of Commerce (B.Com) does offer a wide range of courses that encompass various fields, including telecommunications and banking. B.Com provides a solid foundation in business and finance, making it versatile and applicable to different industries.

While actuarial science is a specialized field, B.Com can still be a strategic choice as it equips you with a comprehensive understanding of business principles, economics, and financial management. This broader knowledge base can enhance your flexibility and marketability in the professional world, allowing you to explore diverse career paths within the business and financial sector. Additionally, B.Com provides a valuable platform from which you can later choose to specialize further through postgraduate studies or professional certifications if desired.
30/01/24, 12:21 pm - +263 78 076 9299: Okay thank u i understand...
30/01/24, 12:30 pm - Pallika Edoofa: So, are you willing to pursue this?

30/01/24, 12:40 pm - +263 78 076 9299: Okay..in five years , according to my view about this course i would  be working since this course covers a myriad of trades under it therefore i will be very markatable in the job industry.Moreso being an Edoofian will impart more skills to me and this therefore will help me to give back to my country or even my community through imparting the skills to others.
30/01/24, 12:47 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I appreciate and admire your insight.

However, as your concierge, I would like to inform you that the professional path you have selected will need a significant amount of hard work and attention.

30/01/24, 4:16 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career. I believe you will be researching about the course in detail.
