Upon completion of her primary she went to a boarding school where she did her form one until four . Passed her ordinary level with 9 subjects with good passes. She is currently doing advanced level upper six specializing in Arts. She is a good talker whom I feel if she would pursue law she will excel. Laurah is a confident person who is open to air her views. Considering her age so far as a parent who spends most of my time with her I don't have any challenges interms of discipline and responsibilities. She is good with others ,very social and responsible even in carrying out her duties as a child or as a big sister to her brother. She loves reading novels online and watching television. She is not an outgoing person ,enjoys indoor activities. 
Her family is madeup of me and my husband and her little brother aged 11. Am an environmental healthy officer under the ministry of homeaffars currently working at Zrp Gweru camp clinic here in Zimbabwe. The father is self employed,he buys and sell stationery here in Zimbabwe. As a family we look forward to her future as she is our first born child whom we are trying to help her have a better future.

Their services can be utilized by the Government, NGOs, other associations or large organizations.

*Required Skill-Set for BA LLB*
It is rightly said that learning is an on – going process and this holds true especially in the aspect of personal and professional development.

*Good Verbal Communication*– A lot depends on how well the legal professional can express his or her case, arguments and generally converse with clients and authorities. Good verbal communication ensures good expression and understanding which are crucial for a successful career in law.
*Good Time Management*– In the legal profession, time management is very crucial. The art of delegating tasks, working within deadlines, and prioritizing tasks to achieve success is very essential.

*A high degree of patience*– This is a much needed skill, since you deal with different types of people and some cases and procedures stretch over a period of time which need a lot of patience and careful handling.
*Team player skills*– Since a legal professional will deal with a lot of people therefore to be effective they need to bond with people. The art of getting work done and obtaining information though networking and working with people helps in attaining the objectives.

24/01/24, 10:56 am - Pallika Edoofa: Laurah and Mr. Makazha,  now as we proceed ahead, I am sure you might have gone through the reasons as to why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education, explained by Program Director Ms Davi back in your school group. Did you understand them properly?
24/01/24, 10:57 am - +263 77 280 9068: Good morning
24/01/24, 11:41 am - +263 77 373 2501: Well yes i did understand her
24/01/24, 12:31 pm - Pallika Edoofa: This message was deleted
24/01/24, 12:32 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright!
24/01/24, 12:32 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I am sure that, you have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead.

*By any chance are you familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship?*
24/01/24, 3:41 pm - +263 77 373 2501: No am not.
24/01/24, 3:59 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That’s alright, Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India compared to other global hubs.

In India, international students face an average expense of *$6000-$8000 annually.* While this is very low as compared to the Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc where the cost of education ranges from $15000-$35000 annually, it is still beyond the reach of many.

With the Edoofa Scholarship Program, the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000 per annum* for the students who are found eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility Check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Laundry, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
24/01/24, 3:59 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
24/01/24, 3:59 pm - Pallika Edoofa: In simple words what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost $3000 or less a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well. 

However, as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even after this we allow the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.

*So do you feel the reduced cost of education is affordable to your family?*
24/01/24, 4:13 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
25/01/24, 9:56 am - Pallika Edoofa: Greeting Everyone,
How are you all doing today?
25/01/24, 10:08 am - +263 77 280 9068: We are fine
25/01/24, 10:12 am - +263 77 373 2501: We good and you
25/01/24, 10:39 am - Pallika Edoofa: I am also doing well!
25/01/24, 10:39 am - Pallika Edoofa: I was expecting your response on this!
25/01/24, 10:55 am - +263 77 280 9068: Will try to work on it
25/01/24, 11:23 am - Pallika Edoofa: I can understand,
So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians. Looking at this cost of education as well, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits which can help in reducing their fees further.

Do you know how that is done?
25/01/24, 11:32 am - +263 77 280 9068: I don't know
25/01/24, 11:55 am - Pallika Edoofa: That’s alright, Let me tell you how Edoofa helps Edoofians bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the *Earn While You Learn Program*

The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that are equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.The Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies and needs, converting an Individual into a market-ready professional. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
25/01/24, 11:55 am - Pallika Edoofa: *Projects with Brands and Companies: -*
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, such as:
*Africa Global Radio-* The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project and hear from the CEO about the exposures of the Edoofa program.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4DAP24ZuY4&authuser=0
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0
*Skooqs-* This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

*Recruitment Partners:-*
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

*Webinars:-*
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars regularly with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
-Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
-How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi
-How to be industry-ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu
-It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje
-Decoding the science of personal branding by Mr, Simon Maingi
25/01/24, 11:55 am - Pallika Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field. These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.

*What are your views on the same? Do you think you will be benefiting from the Earn While You Learn Program?*
26/01/24, 9:23 am - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
26/01/24, 9:25 am - +263 77 280 9068: Ok noted
26/01/24, 9:26 am - Pallika Edoofa: Good afternoon, Ms. Matambo,
Have a great weekend!
26/01/24, 9:47 am - +263 77 280 9068: Thank y
29/01/24, 9:45 am - Pallika Edoofa: Greetings to you all,
As scheduled, I am here to continue your sessions and evaluate your application.
29/01/24, 9:45 am - +263 77 280 9068: Good morning
29/01/24, 9:58 am - Pallika Edoofa: Mr. Makazha, I hope that you are doing well.
29/01/24, 10:02 am - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/01/24, 10:02 am - Pallika Edoofa: I hope that you have gone through this, If I have to help you explain how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable compared to Local Universities, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now, if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, bringing the cost further down to $1000 per year including the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month. *This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*

*You can see this even in this scholarship credit certificate where one of our star performers, our Proud Edoodians  Masinire Miriam earned $1965 within a year.* I hope you can now realize the power of the EWYL program to reduce the financial pressure on families.
