23/01/24, 9:13 pm - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: As we were flooded with applications today and we didn't want to rush your application, so I have managed to reserve a time slot *tomorrow morning at 9:30 AM CAT*, I would appreciate if you stay active and connected at the given time for a 2-hour counseling session so that we can process your application

I am leaving you with a video do go through it properly.

With all due respect I don't think I'm keen to discuss my son's future over text messages on whatsapp.I knew nothing of this and it's a surprise to me.I need time to hear from him what is really happening. 

Kind regards

*"With a dream, comes the potential for achievement."*

On this positive note, are we good to begin today's session?
30/01/24, 4:36 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Hi Lwandle, I hope you are in good health.

I was hoping to connect with you and take your application forward to check your eligibility for the Edoofa Scholarship Program as we have discussed your application, but since you didn’t respond, I am afraid I will have to put your application on hold temporarily. However please Note by Wednesday, I would have to submit my final response regarding your application, so failure to get back to me would mean cancellation of your application after which you would have to re-apply  

Feel free to connect with me again, when you think you are ready to proceed further. Below is a video explaining the details of the Edoofa Program
