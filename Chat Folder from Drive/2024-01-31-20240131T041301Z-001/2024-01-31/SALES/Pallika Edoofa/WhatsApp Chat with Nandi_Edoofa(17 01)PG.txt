24/01/24, 9:40 am - +263 77 899 4760: Good morning
24/01/24, 9:49 am - Pallika Edoofa: As per our previous conversation, Nandi, Let me tell you that the requirements vary depending on the country Since Medical Education and Engineering are two aspects for which the Indian Education System is known, both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level: Physics, Chemistry, and Biology. If they want to study any Engineering Course, they should have Physics and Mathematics at their A level mandatorily.
24/01/24, 9:49 am - Pallika Edoofa: Since you do not have Physics, I regret to inform you that you are not eligible for Medicine and Pharmacy, but considering your interest there are better courses from the Medical Field itself that you are eligible for and which can help fulfill your dreams of working in this field
 
*Bachelor of Science in Medical Lab Technology*

*Physiotherapy*

*Bachelor of Science in Biotechnology*

*Bachelor of Science in Biomedical Sciences*

*Bachelor of Science in Cardiovascular Technology*

*Bachelor of Science in Microbiology*, etc

Would you like me to explain any of these programs for you?
24/01/24, 9:49 am - Pallika Edoofa: @263778994760 Ms. Ndlovu, you can also go through this once
24/01/24, 10:14 am - +263 77 626 4514: May you please explain physiotherapy for me
24/01/24, 11:32 am - Pallika Edoofa: *Physiotherapy* is a branch of healthcare that applies modes of physical movement such as exercise, massage, besides education, advice, and counselling services to circumstances where movement and function are threatened by ageing, pain, injury, diseases, disorders, conditions, or other environmental factors.

Students enrolled to the course are taught on an advanced level about core physiotherapeutic skills such as manual therapy, therapeutic exercises, and application of electro-physical modalities, which have been proven to cure a range of disabilities and disease related to spine, back, neck, and even stress-related incontinence.

Bachelor of Physiotherapy is a 4-year undergraduate course, including compulsory 6 months of clinical internship, and involving the science of physical movement aimed at preventing disease and disability.

The opportunities for a career in Physiotherapy are excellent, whether in the public health system, private practice or non-government organisations. Career pathways include the disciplines and areas of:

*Healthcare Management*
*Industrial Rehabilitation*
*Research & Academics*
*Special Schools*
*Multinational companies for fitness of their employers*
24/01/24, 11:32 am - Pallika Edoofa: Please go through this and let me know once done!
24/01/24, 11:33 am - +263 77 626 4514: I am done
24/01/24, 11:33 am - +263 77 626 4514: I have a chance of pursuing medicine after this program? <This message was edited>
24/01/24, 12:29 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Yes Nandi, 
Certainly! Pursuing any of the above-listed courses, such as Bachelor of Science in Medical Lab Technology, Physiotherapy, Biotechnology, Biomedical Sciences, Cardiovascular Technology, Microbiology, etc., will indeed provide a solid foundation in the medical field. Successfully completing any of these programs can open avenues for you to pursue a career in medicine, making you a successful doctor.
24/01/24, 12:42 pm - +263 77 626 4514: Alright thank you,l am interested in Cardiovascular Technology.
24/01/24, 12:57 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's great!
24/01/24, 12:57 pm - Pallika Edoofa: If you have understood the course well, can you tell me how you see yourself in 5 years after your course If you are provided with this career option and how can being an Edoofian enable you to achieve your career goals?
24/01/24, 1:04 pm - +263 77 626 4514: I see myself working and doing medicine under block release .This will help me to be able to pay some bills.

Being an edoofian will help me pay for my tuition fees ,help me meet different people from across the world ,learn a lot from them and meet various job opportunities from across the world.
24/01/24, 1:13 pm - Pallika Edoofa: t's great to hear about your plans! Pursuing medicine under block release is a practical approach to manage expenses. Edoofian's support for tuition fees and the opportunity to connect with people globally indeed sound like valuable aspects.
24/01/24, 1:13 pm - Pallika Edoofa: However, as your concierge, I would like to inform you that the professional path you have selected will need a significant amount of hard work and attention.

So, are you prepared to put in *200%* effort and seize any possibilities that come your way in order to alter your career?
24/01/24, 1:15 pm - +263 77 899 4760: This message was deleted
24/01/24, 1:16 pm - +263 77 626 4514: Yes ,l am prepared.

I am prepared to work under any circumstances,to push through it all so as to become what l want to be at the end.
24/01/24, 1:24 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career. I believe you will be researching about the course in detail.

24/01/24, 1:35 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I am sure after seeing all these amazing facts, you will be intrigued to study in India
24/01/24, 1:43 pm - +263 77 626 4514: Yes I am very interested to study in India.
24/01/24, 1:49 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That is amazing, As I can see, you have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead.

*By any chance are you familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship?*
24/01/24, 1:54 pm - +263 77 626 4514: Yes they say the lowest fee is $500 and the other universities are $15 000 US dollars but in India it is around $600 US dollars.
24/01/24, 2:21 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That’s alright, Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India compared to other global hubs.

In India, international students face an average expense of *$6000-$8000 annually.* While this is very low as compared to the Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc where the cost of education ranges from $15000-$35000 annually, it is still beyond the reach of many.

With the Edoofa Scholarship Program, the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000 per annum* for the students who are found eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility Check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Laundry, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
24/01/24, 2:22 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
24/01/24, 2:33 pm - +263 77 626 4514: These amounts are in US dollars?
24/01/24, 2:37 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Yes, Nandi
24/01/24, 2:41 pm - +263 77 626 4514: We cannot afford the remaining cost .
24/01/24, 2:42 pm - +263 77 626 4514: My mom is the only one working in the family who supports me ,she cannot afford the amount because she's also paying for my other sibling.
24/01/24, 3:14 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I can understand,
So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians. Looking at this cost of education as well, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits which can help in reducing their fees further.

Do you know how that is done?
24/01/24, 3:15 pm - +263 77 626 4514: Through projects?
24/01/24, 3:24 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That’s alright, Let me tell you how Edoofa helps Edoofians bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the *Earn While You Learn Program*

The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that are equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.The Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies and needs, converting an Individual into a market-ready professional. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
24/01/24, 3:24 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Projects with Brands and Companies: -*
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, such as:
*Africa Global Radio-* The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project and hear from the CEO about the exposures of the Edoofa program.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4DAP24ZuY4&authuser=0
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0
*Skooqs-* This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

*Recruitment Partners:-*
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

*Webinars:-*
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars regularly with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
-Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
-How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi
-How to be industry-ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu
-It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje
-Decoding the science of personal branding by Mr, Simon Maingi
24/01/24, 3:24 pm - Pallika Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field. These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.

*What are your views on the same? Do you think you will be benefiting from the Earn While You Learn Program?*
24/01/24, 3:28 pm - +263 77 626 4514: Yes, EWYL is a beneficial program ,this is so helpful as l will get to learn whilst earning on the side .
24/01/24, 3:33 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
24/01/24, 3:33 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Absolutely,
If I have to help you explain how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable compared to Local Universities, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now, if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, bringing the cost further down to $1000 per year including the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month. *This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*

*You can see this even in this scholarship credit certificate where one of our star performers, our Proud Edoodians  Masinire Miriam earned $1965 within a year.* I hope you can now realize the power of the EWYL program to reduce the financial pressure on families.
24/01/24, 3:48 pm - +263 77 899 4760: Oky Nandi she's going home now bt as soon l got home she will reply

25/01/24, 10:26 am - Pallika Edoofa: Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, a few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :

*1. Expert Career Counselling:* We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counsellors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.

*2. Affordability through guaranteed scholarships:* Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off.

*3. Earn While You Learn:* The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing our students for the real world. 

*4.Higher Education Concierge:* A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.*

After going through these facts that make Edoofa different, which one out of the 4 did you feel is the most significant?
25/01/24, 12:12 pm - +263 77 626 4514: Good afternoon
25/01/24, 12:15 pm - +263 77 899 4760: Higher education concierge because it ensures us that our students are safe with you because you are with them through out the way. Besides wanting our children to achieve their dreams we need to that they are safe and have guardians where ever they are.
25/01/24, 12:30 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Great! 
So now I know you focus more on quality education, services and guidance
Let me also show you some monthly earnings of students through Earn While You Learn.

25/01/24, 12:31 pm - Pallika Edoofa: As you see, there is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it depends upon his/her hard work. However, who will be helping you with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
25/01/24, 12:39 pm - +263 77 899 4760: I will be paying the remaining fee myself .l will be doing piece jobs this side to pay the remaining fee.
25/01/24, 12:47 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That’s understandable,I believe you'll be discussing everything with your family after we complete today's session. Also, after our counselling session, I would connect to some of our beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know their experiences and proceedings well.

May I know how you feel about your child studying abroad?
25/01/24, 12:51 pm - +263 77 899 4760: I am very excited that she will be getting quality education but yet scared of how she will cope .But am very sure she will be fine with the way Edoofa take responsibility of their safety.
25/01/24, 1:14 pm - Pallika Edoofa: It's completely understandable to feel a mix of excitement and apprehension as your loved one embarks on this new educational journey.
25/01/24, 1:14 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Also, Being a parent, the concern regarding the welfare and personal development of their child is absolutely understandable. 

To give a glimpse, we have a community of more than 2500 Zimbabweans with  300+ associate schools from Zimbabwe with a panel of Headmasters, teachers, and parents, who have been bringing success stories of Edoofians for the past 14+ years due to the kind of foster and care that we provide throughout their course!

With UGC-approved Universities whose degrees are Globally accredited, and which have all security and healthcare facilities including counselling departments, Edoofians are exposed to a conducive environment that motivates them to focus on their career and achieve their dreams. There are Zimbabwean Communities at Every University so no child will feel lonely. Moreover, our Admission Team, EWYL(Earn While You Learn) mentor and counsellor of a student will be available to him/her throughout the course. At any point, if the student or parent needs assistance we will be readily accessible. This is the reason why Edoofa is known as a *Higher Education Concierge!*

The Universities are strict in terms of the welfare of children. Being in Zimbabwe itself, your parents will be able to track the happenings, academic performance, and University details

25/01/24, 1:15 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
25/01/24, 1:17 pm - +263 77 899 4760: I am very happy the students are safe at all times
25/01/24, 1:28 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Indeed!
25/01/24, 1:29 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *As we move to the last part of the session, let me highlight a few requirements while a student applies alone* 

*1) Application Form* -An online or offline form that asks for your personal details and academic background.

*2) Statement of Purpose-* An essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and your aspirations for your career.

*3) Letter of Recommendation-* from Senior authorities, School Heads or others on why they recommend you to be a right fit for an international university.
Do you know about other requirements?
25/01/24, 1:34 pm - +263 77 626 4514: Yes l do 

1.Copy of bio-data page of a valid passport
2.Copy of certified O-level and A-level results
25/01/24, 1:37 pm - +263 77 626 4514: 3.Copy of certified birth and ID certificates
25/01/24, 1:37 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Absolutely, When a student applies alone for an international University, on average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose costs between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally and act as a major parameter to decide the child’s eligibility. If you apply to 5 Universities, the average costs for the mentioned would be $1350-$1750, *without even receiving a guarantee to be selected*

*Edoofa has identified a solution for this uncertainty and unaffordability.* If a student qualifies after the eligibility check, not only does Edoofa help them draft their statement of purpose but also helps in terms of Visa Documentation Assistance, University Session and selection, Individual mentorship, etc, reducing the costs significantly to $750 which is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
25/01/24, 1:37 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
25/01/24, 1:40 pm - +263 77 626 4514: Yes please.
25/01/24, 1:43 pm - Pallika Edoofa: .There are 3 phases to the enrollment process.
 
*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation
If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Acceptance Letter. You are supposed to pay the enrollment fee of $350 in 7 days for the scholarship seat reservation and to begin the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2*: Once the students complete Phase 1 they will be starting the Earn While You Learn program session(Each student will have an opportunity to earn scholarship credits that can be used to reduce their fee even before their A-Level result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final A-level results are out and the student has passed the requirement as per Edoofa, then their final university evaluation and Admission will continue. However, if the student wouldn’t meet the requirements as per the university and Edoofa, then the $350 will be refunded to the parent.

The amount of credits earned by the student in phase 2 can be used for the first year’s annual fee itself so that parents are relieved from financial stress paving the way for proper financial planning for higher education.
25/01/24, 1:43 pm - Pallika Edoofa: The enrollment fee is to be paid only if a child is found eligible for the Edoofa Scholarship Program after passing the eligibility check stage, it includes, 

*Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
*Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
*Earn While You Learn Program and training*
*University sessions and selection*
*A guaranteed scholarship seat*
*Visa Documentation Assistance*
*The Foster and Care throughout the course of an Edoofian*
25/01/24, 1:43 pm - Pallika Edoofa: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge due to which parents might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short period of 7 days and for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option wherein if the student is found eligible, instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, *parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days thereby reducing the financial pressure.*
25/01/24, 1:45 pm - +263 77 626 4514: I understand.
25/01/24, 1:45 pm - +263 77 899 4760: Alright,we understand.
25/01/24, 1:45 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
25/01/24, 1:46 pm - +263 77 626 4514: We are done with stage one
25/01/24, 1:47 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's right! <This message was edited>
25/01/24, 1:47 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Well, 
We also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.

*Step 1:Connect with a counsellor-* As your counsellor, now we are going through the counselling process discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Edoofa Scholarship.                        

*Step 2:Eligibility Check-* The eligibility check includes the interviews with the Academic Board and Scholarship Test.

*Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa-* If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter.

*Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program-* This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.

We are left with steps 5 and 6.
So shall I explain them to you?
25/01/24, 1:48 pm - +263 77 626 4514: Yes please.
25/01/24, 1:48 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Sure
25/01/24, 1:48 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 5:* After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities. 

August 2025 intake applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 instalments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.
25/01/24, 1:48 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 6 :* Once you are done with the registration fee payment, you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.

I hope you are clear with the process.
25/01/24, 1:53 pm - +263 77 626 4514: Yes ,it is clear and understandable
25/01/24, 1:53 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Do you have any questions for me now?
25/01/24, 1:56 pm - +263 77 626 4514: No everything is clear.

25/01/24, 3:51 pm - +263 77 899 4760: Alright
25/01/24, 4:19 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Nandi, we have come to the end of your counselling session.

Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage.
If a person suddenly encounters any terrible danger, the change of nature one undergoes is equally great. Sometimes fear numbs our senses. Like animals, one stands still, powerless to move a step in fright or to lift a hand in defense of our lives, and sometimes one is seized with panic, and again, act more like the inferior animals than rational beings. On the other hand, frequently in cases of sudden extreme peril, which cannot be escaped by flight, and must be instantly faced, even the most timid men at once as if by miracle, become possessed of the necessary courage, sharp quick apprehension and swift decision. This is a miracle very common in nature. Man and the inferior animals alike, when confronted with almost certain death ‘ gather resolution from despair’ but there can really be no trace of so debilitating a feeling in the person fighting, or prepared to fight for dear life. At such times the mind is clearer than it has ever been; the nerves are steel, there is nothing felt but a wonderful strength and daring. Looking back at certain perilous moments in my own life, I remember them with a kind of joy, not that there was any joyful excitement then, but because they broadened my horizon, lifted me for a time above myself.

Whey to Go Greek yogurt—a strained form of cultured yogurt—has grown enormously in popularity in the United States since it was first introduced in the country in the late 1980s. From 2011 to 2012 alone, sales of Greek yogurt in the US increased by 50 percent. The resulting increase in Greek yogurt production has forced those involved in the business to address the detrimental effects that the yogurt-making process may be having on the environment. Fortunately, farmers and others in the Greek yogurt business have found many methods of controlling and eliminating most environmental threats. Given these solutions as well as the many health benefits of the food, the advantages of Greek yogurt Q5. outdo the potential drawbacks of its production.Sentence [1] The main environmental problem caused by the production of Greek yogurt is the creation of acid whey as a by-product.Sentence [2] Because it requires up to four times more milk to make than conventional yogurt does, Greek yogurt produces larger amounts of acid whey, which is difficult to dispose of.Sentence [3] To address the problem of disposal, farmers have found a number of uses for acid whey. Sentence[4] They can add it to livestock feed as a protein Q.6. supplement and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt. Sentence[5] If it is improperly introduced into the environment, acid-whey runoff Q.7. can pollute waterways, depleting the oxygen content of streams and rivers as it decomposes. Sentence [6] Yogurt manufacturers, food Q.8. scientists; and government officials are also working together to develop additional solutions for reusing whey.

Section 5

16 years after the genocide the surviving members and their families continue to present with considerable rates of PTSD and substantial depressive and anxiety symptoms.A strong association was revealed between health problems and psychosocial factors such as social integration.A high level of PTSD in the group of former prisoners ,this demonstrates that psychosocial suffering affected the population at large ,however the nature of traumatic stressors may have varied.People often ask who owns trauma .By challenging the question discourses in post conflict society such as Rwanda ,mental health services took the need of the entire population into consideration when offering care .The descendants of the genocide survivors showed a higher risk for mental health problems than descendants of former prisoners.A high trauma load as well as missing family integration and support characterizes their specific vulnerable situation.Interventions and initiatives that stimulate reconciliation processes between future generations should take these particularities into consideration.


Section 6

When l was in primary , doing grade 6 to be exact .My younger sibling was still in Crash . My mom started having heart failure.She would faint every time after her menstrual period .Doctors thought it was shortage of blood .They gave her blood supplements but it never stopped . She went for a check and they said she had a vein that blocked blood .This gave me fear . I was so scared thinking l was going to loose her and l will have to look after my sibling.We didn't have money to take her for operation therefore she depended on traditional herbs .The herbs kept her moving . My grandmother also started getting sick ,she had cancer on the oesophagus. She failed to get treatment early and died when I was doing my first year in High school. This made me want to be a doctor because of the pain l went through after loosing my grandmother and the fear of loosing my mother. It made me to push through in every difficult situations, because l want to be a doctor at the end of the day . The sickness of my mother is what is keeping me moving even today , we don't have money to take her to operation therefore l am praying one day l will be there when she goes through her first operation and l will be a doctor.

So I wanted to ask that for the same, so could you and your parent be online for the next 20 minutes to answer my question?
26/01/24, 4:09 pm - +263 77 626 4514: It's alright
26/01/24, 4:18 pm - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: Are they online as of now please?

26/01/24, 4:23 pm - +263 77 899 4760: Yes l did .
26/01/24, 4:23 pm - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: So far would you like to ask anything please?
26/01/24, 4:24 pm - +263 77 899 4760: I understood quite a lot since I went through the FAQ document.
26/01/24, 4:26 pm - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: That is great Ms Ndlovu.
26/01/24, 4:27 pm - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: Ms Ndlovu, you see as per my experience over the last couple of years, I have been fortunate to have assisted over hundreds of students in achieving their career aspiration through the Edoofa Program. 

One of my key observations during helping out these students was regarding what was the common trait amongst students who are today having the best of their time in India through the Edoofa Program, and honestly I was able to come down to only one aspect that is FAMILY SUPPORT.
26/01/24, 4:27 pm - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: You see in this journey of any child's higher education, there are three major contributors 

1. Student himself/herself
2. FAMILY
3. EDOOFA PROGAM

Now all the students who are today successfully a part of the Edoofa Program, had all these three contributors working together towards the common goal which is student's success and ensuring that by the time student completes his/her higher education they should be able to get good paying jobs. 

Even if any one of the contributor does not perform to the best of their abilities, Student's overall success is hampered. Let me give you a few examples

*In the event if student wishes to work hard, Edoofa is willing to support but the Family is not willing to support, the student will not be successful under the program*

*In the event if student wishes to work hard, Family is willing to support, but Edoofa's academic Board doesn't find the student worthy, the student will not be successful under the program*

*In the event if Family is willing to support, Edoofa's Academic Board is willing to support but the student doesn't wishes to work hard, then also the student will not be successful under the program*
26/01/24, 4:28 pm - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: During the evaluation of your child's application so far, the Academic Board has evaluated a few aspects, such as student's willingness to work hard, and family's willingness to support the student so that the student can achieve what he/she has aspired. However now in your interview ahead, the Academic Board would be strictly be evaluating the Family's support towards the child higher education. 

*As you know in the event if your child is found eligible, you would have to complete a certain part of the formalities within the 7 day timeline, so may I know regarding the same, are you willing to support your child to the fullest?*
26/01/24, 4:31 pm - +263 77 899 4760: Yes, l am willing to support my child in any way possible. Yes l am aware of the enrollment fee and l have started saving for that .If everything goes well and she qualifies for the program l will willing and ready to support her emotional, physically, spiritually and Financially.
26/01/24, 4:45 pm - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: I am glad to hear that Ms Ndlovu, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
26/01/24, 4:47 pm - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: You see, during my stay in Zimbabwe from March to June 2023, I gained valuable insights. Many Zimbabwean students, including those I interacted with and those who shared their experiences, highlighted the financial challenges of pursuing higher education. Tertiary education expenses in Zimbabwe can amount to approximately $3000-$4000 annually.

While the cost of education remains within the range of $1200-$1500 per year, the cost of living is notably high. Even a basic meal of Sadza and curry can cost a student $1 per serving. This means around $1100 is allocated solely for food, with additional essential costs such as internet, accommodation, and transportation pushing the total to $2000-$2500 per year.

During my visit, I encountered Zimbabwean students who had applied for the Edoofa Program in 2018-2019 but hadn't proceeded due to the lure of quick earnings within the country. However, this year, they shared their hardships, with some holding prestigious degrees from institutions like UZ, MSU, and HIT, now working as petrol attendants or mobile/laptop repair technicians. Others faced even greater challenges, resorting to selling Ecocash, Simcards, or vegetables.

Observing this scenario, it's evident that many of them regret not seizing the opportunity earlier. I understand the harsh realities they face.

Here are a few pictures of my interactions with students and their parents during my time there
26/01/24, 4:52 pm - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: <Media omitted>
26/01/24, 4:52 pm - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: <Media omitted>
26/01/24, 4:52 pm - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: Now surely as a parent this might be the last thing you would want for your child, because of which you are tremendously working hard. However since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. *The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.*

2. *On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program.* 

Or 

*A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.*

Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.
26/01/24, 4:52 pm - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: <Media omitted>
26/01/24, 4:53 pm - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: Ideally as you know, the tentative dates:

1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 5th or 6th February 2024 for $200 and the 5th or 6th of March for the remaining $150.

2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 5th or 6th February 2024.
26/01/24, 4:54 pm - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?
26/01/24, 5:02 pm - +263 77 899 4760: I would opt for the first one , l am prepared to pay the first $200 in within the first 7 days and the remaining in the next 30 days
26/01/24, 5:13 pm - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: Alright Ms Ndlovu, for the same you have started preparing right?
26/01/24, 5:15 pm - +263 77 899 4760: Yes sir.
26/01/24, 5:16 pm - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: Alright in that case shall I get you the interview slots of tomorrow?
