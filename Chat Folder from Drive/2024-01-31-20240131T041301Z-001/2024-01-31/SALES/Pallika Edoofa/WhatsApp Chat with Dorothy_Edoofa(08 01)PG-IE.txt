11/01/24, 10:15 am - Pallika Edoofa: Alright!
11/01/24, 10:15 am - Pallika Edoofa: Let me brief you that, I want to brief you that the criteria before the pandemic was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is *a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.
11/01/24, 10:15 am - Pallika Edoofa: And,As your evaluation progresses, I appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country. In this process did you do any prior research on foreign education or applied to any University abroad? <This message was edited>

11/01/24, 11:13 am - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Dorothy, Based on my evaluation, considering your subjects, interests, and passion, you are eligible to pursue


​*B.Tech Civil Engineering*



Do you want me to explain the course in depth?
11/01/24, 11:15 am - +263 77 299 8009: Yes please
11/01/24, 11:27 am - Pallika Edoofa: Sure
11/01/24, 11:27 am - Pallika Edoofa: ​*B.Tech Civil Engineering: What is it About?*

Civil engineering is one of the oldest engineering disciplines in the world. Civil engineering, until a few decades back, was a much sought after course among Indian students, but lately has been sidelined due to the software and IT boom. However with the increasing need to develop and maintain India’s infrastructure, which is lagging in all aspects, this field is bouncing back strongly.

There are options for higher studies after the completion of B.Tech. course. Students can pursue Master’s degree in specialized course. Master of Technology (M.Tech.) in Civil engineering and other allied branches like-

*Structural Engineering*
*Architectural Engineering*
*Geotechnical Engineering*
*Environmental Engineering etc.*

*B.Tech Civil Engineering: Who should opt?*

Before you decide to pursue your undergraduate studies in this field, it is important to understand that Civil engineering is not just about buildings and bridges. If you are under the assumption that all that civil engineers do is wear a yellow helmet and supervise workers in construction sites, then you are yet to understand the true capacity of this field. 


*Career aspects*

In these cases, you will have to hunt for a core engineering job all by yourself through off-campus placements. Creating strong professional networks, developing a great resume with stellar GPA and doing impressive projects and internships will help you secure a job in one of the core civil engineering companies.

Also, civil engineers find work not just in construction industry, but also in other industries such as oil and energy, transportation, petroleum, environmental, power and electric utilities, chemical etc where infrastructure projects and construction facilities are involved. Some students transition to software, consulting or banking as they feel that salary and growth prospects are better in these sectors.
11/01/24, 11:27 am - Pallika Edoofa: *I hope this course aligns with what you are aiming for.*
11/01/24, 1:55 pm - +263 77 299 8009: Yes please
11/01/24, 1:57 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Dorothy, If you have understood the course well, can you tell me how you see yourself in 5 years after your course If you are provided with this career option and how can being an Edoofian enable you to achieve your career goals?

18/01/24, 3:42 pm - +27 61 620 7327: We just know its very expensive and we cant afford it. Though we are willing to give such to our kids.
18/01/24, 4:01 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Kindly excuse the delay as my meeting took a little longer than expected!
18/01/24, 4:01 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That’s alright, Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India compared to other global hubs.

In India, international students face an average expense of *$6000-$8000 annually.* While this is very low as compared to the Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc where the cost of education ranges from $15000-$35000 annually, it is still beyond the reach of many.

With the Edoofa Scholarship Program, the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000 per annum* for the students who are found eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility Check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Laundry, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
18/01/24, 4:02 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
18/01/24, 4:02 pm - Pallika Edoofa: In simple words what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost $3000 or less a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well. 

However, as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even after this we allow the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.

*So do you feel the reduced cost of education is affordable to your family?*
18/01/24, 4:20 pm - +27 61 620 7327: I cant afford
18/01/24, 4:21 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I can understand,
So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians. Looking at this cost of education as well, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits which can help in reducing their fees further.

Do you know how that is done?
18/01/24, 4:22 pm - +27 61 620 7327: No u can explain to us we dont have idea on how its done
18/01/24, 4:23 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Sure
18/01/24, 4:23 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That’s alright, Let me tell you how Edoofa helps Edoofians bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the *Earn While You Learn Program*

The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that are equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.The Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies and needs, converting an Individual into a market-ready professional. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
18/01/24, 4:23 pm - Pallika Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field. These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.

*What are your views on the same? Do you think you will be benefiting from the Earn While You Learn Program?*

19/01/24, 9:36 am - Pallika Edoofa: Greetings!

*Success is a journey, not a destination.*

On this positive note, shall we begin with your session?
19/01/24, 12:25 pm - +27 61 620 7327: Ok
19/01/24, 12:35 pm - Pallika Edoofa: How are you doing today?
19/01/24, 12:35 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Please address this.
19/01/24, 12:46 pm - +263 77 299 8009: I appreciate all the efforts being made by the university in changing people's lives.  I am eager to benefit from the earn while you work program
19/01/24, 12:48 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
19/01/24, 12:48 pm - Pallika Edoofa: If I have to help you explain how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable compared to Local Universities, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now, if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, bringing the cost further down to $1000 per year including the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month. *This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*

*You can see this even in this scholarship credit certificate where one of our star performers, our Proud Edoodians  Masinire Miriam earned $1965 within a year.* I hope you can now realize the power of the EWYL program to reduce the financial pressure on families.
19/01/24, 1:01 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Please excuse me for some time as I am heading for my lunch. Let us connect at 02:00 pm CAT for the next part of our session. Let me know if you have any challenges with the schedule. 

Meanwhile, you can go through our Social Media pages to learn more about the experiences of Edoofians and the program!

22/01/24, 10:09 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Dorothy, I've noticed that you haven't been actively participating in our chats, and it's important to emphasize that active engagement is a crucial aspect of this program. Your current level of participation is not in line with our requirements. I will monitor your application for two more days, and if there is no improvement in your activity during that time, we may have to consider revoking it.
23/01/24, 1:47 am - +263 77 299 8009: My apologies.  We are facing network challenges in this part of the country
23/01/24, 3:38 am - +27 61 620 7327: She is at school they dont allow phone. Plus network problem. Busy with school work of which out of it thats where we expecting the results for you to take her. If it was one day quastions and its done. We would ask the school. But from the way l see it its a journey. We like your program but may you bare with us. We need you but at the same time we cant make her break the school rules. Pliz bare with us until you get all the iformation you want. And us knowing more about you better.
23/01/24, 10:06 am - Pallika Edoofa: Good Afternoon to you all,
How are you doing today?
23/01/24, 10:13 am - +27 61 620 7327: We all fine thank you
23/01/24, 10:29 am - Pallika Edoofa: Glad to know that, Ms. Elder! <This message was edited>
23/01/24, 10:30 am - Pallika Edoofa: I understand that, Ms. Elder, However, Please note that you can also have the discussion on Dorothy's behalf.
23/01/24, 12:01 pm - +27 61 620 7327: Noted thank you
23/01/24, 12:10 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Ms. Elder, we are about to proceed to Stage 2 and end our today's session, so, i would like you to actively respond in the group for the next 20-25 minutes, please
23/01/24, 12:10 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Continuing the session,  Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, a few facts that you must have noticed during our counseling:

*1. Expert Career Counselling:* We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counsellors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.

*2. Affordability through guaranteed scholarships:* Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off.

*3. Earn While You Learn:* The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing our students for the real world. 

*4.Higher Education Concierge:* A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.*

After going through these facts that make Edoofa different, which one out of the 4 did you feel is the most significant?
23/01/24, 12:31 pm - +263 77 299 8009: 3
23/01/24, 12:39 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Great! 
So now I know you focus more on affordability and employability.
Let me also show you some monthly earnings of students through Earn While You Learn.

23/01/24, 12:39 pm - Pallika Edoofa: As you see, there is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it depends upon his/her hard work. However, who will be helping you with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
23/01/24, 12:50 pm - +263 77 299 8009: We help as the parents
23/01/24, 12:51 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Thank you for acknowledging this, dear parent!
23/01/24, 12:51 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, as studying Internationally would make your career advance at an even greater pace, as you will be transformed into a professional with a well-paying job, which would help you in uplifting your family there by yourself, and provide a peaceful and hassle-free life to your parents.
23/01/24, 12:51 pm - Pallika Edoofa: @263772998009, I believe you'll be discussing everything with your family after we complete today's session. Also, after our counselling session, I would connect to some of our beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know their experiences and proceedings well.

May I know how you feel about your child studying abroad?
23/01/24, 1:17 pm - +27 61 620 7327: Happy, blessed🙏
23/01/24, 1:20 pm - +27 61 620 7327: But also challenge to help our child get better results for the opportunity
23/01/24, 1:35 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, studying Internationally would make your child’s career advance at an even greater pace, as your child will be transformed into a professional with a Greater Paying Job, which would help in uplifting your family and provide a hassle-free life.
23/01/24, 1:35 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *As we move to the last part of the session, let me highlight a few requirements while a student applies alone* 

*1) Application Form* -An online or offline form that asks for your personal details and academic background.

*2) Statement of Purpose-* An essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and your aspirations for your career.

*3) Letter of Recommendation-* from Senior authorities, School Heads or others on why they recommend you to be a right fit for an international university.
Do you know about other requirements?
23/01/24, 2:50 pm - +263 77 299 8009: No
23/01/24, 2:50 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's alright, I have listed the main requirements!
23/01/24, 2:50 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Also, When a student applies alone for an international University, on average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose costs between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally and act as a major parameter to decide the child’s eligibility. If you apply to 5 Universities, the average costs for the mentioned would be $1350-$1750, *without even receiving a guarantee to be selected*

*Edoofa has identified a solution for this uncertainty and unaffordability.* If a student qualifies after the eligibility check, not only does Edoofa help them draft their statement of purpose but also helps in terms of Visa Documentation Assistance, University Session and selection, Individual mentorship, etc, reducing the costs significantly to $750 which is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
23/01/24, 2:51 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/01/24, 2:55 pm - +27 61 620 7327: Yes
23/01/24, 2:55 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Sure
23/01/24, 2:56 pm - Pallika Edoofa: There are 3 phases to the enrollment process.
 
*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation
If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Acceptance Letter. You are supposed to pay the enrollment fee of $350 in 7 days for the scholarship seat reservation and to begin the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2*: Once the students complete Phase 1 they will be starting the Earn While You Learn program session(Each student will have an opportunity to earn scholarship credits that can be used to reduce their fee even before their A-Level result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final A-level results are out and the student has passed the requirement as per Edoofa, then their final university evaluation and Admission will continue. However, if the student wouldn’t meet the requirements as per the university and Edoofa, then the $350 will be refunded to the parent.

The amount of credits earned by the student in phase 2 can be used for the first year’s annual fee itself so that parents are relieved from financial stress paving the way for proper financial planning for higher education.
23/01/24, 2:56 pm - Pallika Edoofa: The enrollment fee is to be paid only if a child is found eligible for the Edoofa Scholarship Program after passing the eligibility check stage, it includes, 

*Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
*Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
*Earn While You Learn Program and training*
*University sessions and selection*
*A guaranteed scholarship seat*
*Visa Documentation Assistance*
*The Foster and Care throughout the course of an Edoofian*
23/01/24, 2:56 pm - Pallika Edoofa: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge due to which parents might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short period of 7 days and for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option wherein if the student is found eligible, instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, *parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days thereby reducing the financial pressure.*
23/01/24, 4:49 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
24/01/24, 9:41 am - Pallika Edoofa: Good afternoon Dorothy and Dear Parents,
I hope that this message finds you well today.

Shall we continue our discussion, please?
24/01/24, 1:32 pm - +27 61 620 7327: Yes we can
24/01/24, 1:32 pm - +27 61 620 7327: Afternoon sir
24/01/24, 1:37 pm - Pallika Edoofa: How are you doing today, Ms. Elder?
24/01/24, 1:38 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
24/01/24, 3:14 pm - +27 61 620 7327: Good thank you
24/01/24, 3:14 pm - +27 61 620 7327: Stage 5
24/01/24, 3:16 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Well, Ms. Elder,
We also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.

*Step 1:Connect with a counsellor-* As your counsellor, now we are going through the counselling process discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Edoofa Scholarship.                        

*Step 2:Eligibility Check-* The eligibility check includes the interviews with the Academic Board and Scholarship Test.

*Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa-* If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter.

*Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program-* This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.

We are left with steps 5 and 6.
So shall I explain them to you?
24/01/24, 3:18 pm - +27 61 620 7327: Yes you can  thank you
24/01/24, 3:19 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Sure
24/01/24, 3:19 pm - +27 61 620 7327: Yes
24/01/24, 3:19 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 5:* After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities. 

August 2025 intake applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 instalments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.
24/01/24, 3:19 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 6 :* Once you are done with the registration fee payment, you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.

I hope you are clear with the process.
24/01/24, 4:28 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Ms. Elder, Are we connected?
24/01/24, 5:31 pm - +27 61 620 7327: Yes l  understand
25/01/24, 9:57 am - Pallika Edoofa: Greeting Everyone,
How are you all doing today?
25/01/24, 4:24 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Ms. Elder, we have come to the end of your counselling session. Before I guide you Step 2 of the Eligibility Check, I want you to have a full-fledged discussion of the Edoofa program within your family as higher education is supposed to be a family decision. Ensure to include these aspects during the discussions:-

*About the EDOOFA Program and its vision of making Education Affordable and Edoofians Employment Ready.*
*Value of the career of an Edoofian after pursuing higher education in India.*
*The financial aspects and how Edoofa brings in affordability and self-financing opportunities for students.*
25/01/24, 4:24 pm - Pallika Edoofa: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences,

*Edoofa’s Website- www.edoofa.com* 
*Pictures (Edoofians from Africa studying in India): https://tinyurl.com/3ke35s35*

*Please ensure to go through the FAQ document before the next stage and refer the same to your family as it has answers to most of the queries.* Furthermore, if you have any other queries I would suggest that you note them down and we will discuss them in the next session.

Let me also share a few pictures of the students who are studying in India through the Edoofa Program so that you can witness the exposures and their experiences.

30/01/24, 9:02 am - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: Excuse me for my delayed response, as by the time yesterday we were having a word it was 12:30am in India because of which I couldn't continue with our discussion!
30/01/24, 9:03 am - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: @27616207327 this is quite a good question, as a lot of people have a misconception, about what kind of religious practices are followed in India.

You see, India is a secular country, wherein by the rule of law, every citizen is free to practice whatever they believe in, without interfering with the belief of another person.

Currently, you would be surprised to know there are 2.8 million people in India who follow Christianity, this number is twice the population of entire Zimbabwe.

Due to this, from last 6 years, our students have never had a challenge in following whatever they have always believed in, since most of the students who follow Christianity, visit church for their Sunday Prayers.
