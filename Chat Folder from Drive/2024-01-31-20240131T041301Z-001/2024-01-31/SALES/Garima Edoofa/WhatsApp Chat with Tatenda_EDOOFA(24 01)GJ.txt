29/01/24, 8:44 am - Garima Edoofa: Good Morning @263716499268 @263713668818 , Hope you are doing well.

I am here to continue with our session, shall we start?
29/01/24, 8:45 am - +263 71 649 9268: Good morning to you too. We are doing well here.
29/01/24, 8:46 am - +263 71 649 9268: Yes please
29/01/24, 9:42 am - Garima Edoofa: Since you have understood the course properly.

Can you now tell me, if you are provided with this career option, how do you see yourself 5 years after the completion of this course?
And if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
29/01/24, 9:45 am - +263 71 649 9268: In 5 years time I see myself on another big level of being an Economist through the Edoofa Program.
29/01/24, 9:58 am - Garima Edoofa: I appreciate and admire your foresightedness at the same time, Tatenda.

However, as your concierge, I would like to share with you that the career path which you have chosen ahead, will require a lot of hard work and dedication.

So are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way in order to transform your career dear?
29/01/24, 10:02 am - +263 71 649 9268: I am willing to give more than 200% hard work to take the opportunities.
29/01/24, 10:44 am - Garima Edoofa: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
29/01/24, 10:46 am - +263 71 649 9268: Because in my country there are very few resources and also there are no opportunities and jobs.
The Economy is poor as well.
29/01/24, 12:17 pm - Garima Edoofa: Excuse me for the delay in my response, I was in a meeting with the academic board regarding your application.
29/01/24, 12:17 pm - Garima Edoofa: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
29/01/24, 12:25 pm - +263 71 649 9268: If am given the opportunity I can help my country through seminars and websites to share the learnings from abroad and also to write Economics Textbooks that helps the education system in Zimbabwe.
29/01/24, 12:51 pm - Garima Edoofa: I appreciate your sense of hardwork for your community Tatenda, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?
29/01/24, 2:13 pm - +263 71 649 9268: Yes I agree
29/01/24, 2:16 pm - Garima Edoofa: Okay so Tatenda as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
29/01/24, 2:24 pm - +263 71 649 9268: $1500-$2250
29/01/24, 2:24 pm - Garima Edoofa: Exactly Tatenda, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
29/01/24, 2:24 pm - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/01/24, 2:28 pm - +263 71 649 9268: Okay I get it.
29/01/24, 2:33 pm - Garima Edoofa: You see Tatenda this is an amazing aspect about the program itself because for all the students who are found eligible for the Edoofa Program they get the benefit of Edoofa guaranteeing them admission and scholarship by helping them create the statement of purpose along with that they get opportunities where you can apply to multiple universities and receive an offer letter from them without any additional fee, and majorly this enrollment fee also includes the SEELS's Earn While You Learn Program. So apart from the Enrollment fee they wouldn't pay anything separate for their application fee or SOP fee!

So for an Edoofian the Enrollment Fee would include:

*1. Guaranteed Scholarship*
*2. Application fee of all the Edoofa’s Associated Universities*
*3. Cost of Multiple Statement of Purposes drafted*
*4. Recommendation Letter drafted for the Student*
*5. Earn While You Learn Program’s Training*
*6. Visa Assistance*

I hope now you will be in a better position to relate how Exactly Edoofa is trying to bring the change in the Admission process for International Students?
29/01/24, 9:13 pm - +263 71 649 9268: Yes l am relating now.
30/01/24, 9:18 am - Garima Edoofa: Good Morning Tatenda
30/01/24, 9:18 am - Garima Edoofa: I was expecting your response since yesterday, may I know what happened?
30/01/24, 1:02 pm - +263 71 649 9268: Sorry I was out of bundle Ma'am so sorry
30/01/24, 2:15 pm - Garima Edoofa: @263716499268 as of now are we good to have a discussion?
30/01/24, 3:28 pm - +263 71 649 9268: Yes I am.
30/01/24, 3:28 pm - +263 71 649 9268: We can discuss
30/01/24, 4:37 pm - Garima Edoofa: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
30/01/24, 5:20 pm - +263 71 649 9268: Okay
