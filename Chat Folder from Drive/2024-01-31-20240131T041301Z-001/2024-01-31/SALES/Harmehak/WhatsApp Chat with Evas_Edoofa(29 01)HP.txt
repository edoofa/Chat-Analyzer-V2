So what is your financial planning for your higher education, Evas?
29/01/24, 2:50 pm - +263 77 853 3959: If l get a scholarship it may help me.
29/01/24, 2:54 pm - Harmehak: Evas, first let me explain to you that there are two kinds of programs that provide assistance to the students because a lot of times parents and students themselves misunderstand what a Scholarship actually means.

*1. Scholarships*
*2. Sponsorships*

Scholarships make education *affordable* for the students by reducing their *Tuition Fees*, now a lot of times parents and students consider that a Domestic Scholarship would be the same as an International Scholarship, but to understand the difference between them, consider yourself applying for an education in your own country with the help of a scholarship. Now after the scholarship when your tuition fee would be reduced, eventually your entire cost of education would be reduced because being a citizen of the country, you wouldn't be required to spend any fees on Accommodation and feeding separately since in that case, students would be staying with their families. However, if I personally plan to study in Zimbabwe with the same scholarship, I would have to incur some costs on Accommodation and Feeding because I am not a Zimbabwean Citizen. So a lot of times parents and students consider International Scholarship and Domestic Scholarship one and the same thing, but in reality, they aren't.

Sponsorships, on the other hand, take care entirely of a student's education, but because Sponsorships are provided by only a few organizations, there are a lot of terms and conditions which a student might need to follow in order to get the sponsorship, the most common term is that a student after completion of the course would have to work for the organization providing the sponsorship for a period of time.
29/01/24, 2:58 pm - +263 77 853 3959: Oky l get the sense
29/01/24, 3:01 pm - +263 77 853 3959: So here u can tell they l will appreciate if l get a scholarship either partial or fully funded am sure my mum would raise some funds in assistance.
29/01/24, 3:01 pm - Harmehak: May I know your understanding of a fully funded scholarship, Evas?
29/01/24, 3:02 pm - +263 77 853 3959: l will appreciate if l get a scholarship either partial or fully funded am sure my mum would raise some funds in assistance.
29/01/24, 3:03 pm - Harmehak: I do understand Evas
29/01/24, 3:04 pm - Harmehak: Did you follow the question please?
29/01/24, 3:04 pm - +263 77 853 3959: Yes
29/01/24, 3:05 pm - Harmehak: Kindly address the same.
29/01/24, 3:05 pm - +263 77 853 3959: It's a scholarship whereby the sponsor will be paying for everything during the academic period.

29/01/24, 3:09 pm - +263 77 853 3959: Yes .
29/01/24, 3:10 pm - Harmehak: So is your mother willing to support you with $1200-1400 a year?
29/01/24, 3:12 pm - +263 77 853 3959: yes because she is striving for the best for me.
29/01/24, 3:13 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate,

*1) Legal Advisor*
The main role of a legal advisor or legal counsellor is to offer legal advice and work, for organizations and the employees of the organization. Their services can be utilized by the Government, NGOs, other associations or large organizations.  The legal advisors are in-house experts, in contrast to attorneys and supporters who offer their services to society in general. It is often seen that legal advisors were former advocates and therefore their skills and training have to be in accordance with those that are needed for attorneys and advocates.

*2) Lawyer*
As is evident by the title, is a person whose profession is law. There are different specializations for law including Cyber law, Environmental law, Company law, Criminal law and Family Law. Their main job role is to represent their clients in jurisdiction matters. Their work involves a lot of research, including that on the subject and their client’s perspective.

The criminal procedure code of 1973 under section 24, outlines the arrangements concerning the Public Prosecutor.

*4) Judge*

It is rightly said that learning is an on – going process and this holds true especially in the aspect of personal and professional development. Although an individual may possess certain skills they need to be improved and developed constantly. A few key skills that are of paramount importance in the field of law are:

*Good Written Communication*– Writing forms a major part of the work in in the legal profession. The written communication involves letters, documents, notices, and so on. The documents must be grammatically correct and error free. This requires a good level of English proficiency.

*Good Verbal Communication*– A lot depends on how well the legal professional can express his or her case, arguments and generally converse with clients and authorities. Good verbal communication ensures good expression and understanding which are crucial for a successful career in law.

*Good Time Management*– In the legal profession, time management is very crucial. The art of delegating tasks, working within deadlines, and prioritizing tasks to achieve success is very essential.

*A great degree of self-confidence*– This profession needs a high degree of self-confidence to win the clients’ trust. A strong belief in yourself will go a long way in winning arguments and cases.

*An analytical mind and good research skills*– A case with proper research and well-reasoned out and evaluated argument stands a very high chance of success.

*High EQ (Emotional Quotient)*– Individuals in the legal profession, especially lawyers, must learn to be empathetic.

*Tech Savvy*– In the rapidly developing and evolving technological world, they must be abreast of the latest technology to understand and use it, as and when needed. They need to use technology to their advantage to improve their efficiency and chances of success.

*Good Commercial awareness*– This is not only restricted to being aware of the current trends and technology, prevalent in the world of business and law, but also being aware of the developments in the world of business and law, both nationally and globally.

*A high degree of patience*– This is a much needed skill, since you deal with different types of people and some cases and procedures stretch over a period of time which need a lot of patience and careful handling.

*Team player skills*– Since a legal professional will deal with a lot of people therefore to be effective they need to bond with people. The art of getting work done and obtaining information though networking and working with people helps in attaining the objectives.

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
30/01/24, 9:45 am - +263 77 853 3959: Morning how are you today
30/01/24, 9:45 am - +263 77 853 3959: Yes we can start
30/01/24, 9:50 am - Harmehak: What motivates you to study Social work, Evas?
30/01/24, 9:50 am - Harmehak: I am doing well please

30/01/24, 10:03 am - Harmehak: I appreciate the same!
30/01/24, 10:03 am - Harmehak: Now let me help you have a better understanding, social work is a great course at the current time. From my personal experience of being in the field of education, I see many students apply for the course, but being a very niche course, a lot of universities don't offer the same because the cost of the course is very high and since it's a practical course, and the ones who do they don't offer scholarships on the course as the investment to teach such a course to a number of students becomes very high for the university as well. 

Now usually what students do is, that they pursue a course that is similar to this particular course. A student can do all the related jobs without a degree of social work. A lot of time students pursue a course called Bachelor of Sociology. The base of this course and the base of social work as a course in similar in nature which is why students who pursue this course end up having career opportunities in the field of social work!
30/01/24, 10:03 am - Harmehak: Social work and sociology have many similarities when it comes to career aspirations. For both professions, the main goal is to work with individuals, families, and communities to improve the quality of life and promote positive change. Both social work and sociology focus on understanding the causes of social problems and developing strategies to address them.

Social workers and sociologists use similar skills and approaches to help people, including interviewing, counseling, advocating, and providing support and resources. They also draw on research methods and theories to inform their practice and shape their interventions. For example, sociologists may conduct research on a particular population to gain a better understanding of how their environment, culture, and other factors influence their behavior and quality of life. This knowledge can then be applied to the development of social policy and change initiatives.

Both social workers and sociologists also strive to create a more equitable and just society. They recognize the importance of understanding and appreciating diversity, as well as the need to challenge oppression, discrimination, and social injustice. They work together to create an environment that values and respects all people, regardless of race, gender, class, or other factors.

Overall, social work and sociology have similar goals and approaches to promoting positive change. They both recognize the importance of understanding the root causes of social problems and developing strategies to address them. They also strive to create a more equitable and just society by challenging oppression, discrimination, and social injustice.

30/01/24, 10:20 am - +263 77 853 3959: No.
30/01/24, 10:20 am - Harmehak: Alright Evas, since you have understood the course, can you please tell me, if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself in 5 years and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
30/01/24, 10:27 am - +263 77 853 3959: I can see myself will be very excited because my dream will be fullfilled .

30/01/24, 10:35 am - Harmehak: That is really great Evas, I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations!

Now, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
30/01/24, 10:38 am - +263 77 853 3959: I want to study abroad because there is quality education in law. In Zimbabwe they do not offer quality education of arts department .
30/01/24, 10:45 am - Harmehak: You see, Evas, Senior Academician Mr. Piyush was in Zimbabwe for about 90 days. He had the privilege of meeting many Zimbabwean students who had applied for the Edoofa Program back in 2018-2019. However, at that time, they didn't proceed because they were enticed by the prospect of earning quick money in the country. This year, when they met him, they shared how difficult things have been for them. Some of them, despite holding reputed degrees from UZ, MSU, and HIT, are working as petrol attendants, while others have started careers as mobile/laptop repair technicians. Some were facing even more challenges, resorting to selling Ecocash, Simcards, or vegetables.

Observing this scenario, Mr. Piyush saw many of them regretting not seizing the opportunity when they had the chance. So, what you are sharing, I can understand that, in reality, things are much more challenging over there.
30/01/24, 10:49 am - +263 77 853 3959: That's true Ms .
30/01/24, 10:51 am - +263 77 853 3959: Things are challenging  in Zimbabwe that is why l choose to study abroad.
30/01/24, 11:01 am - Harmehak: I understand and I appreciate your efforts for a promising future, Evas.

Now as you know Edoofa Recommends India as a Higher Education destination.

*May I know what is your knowledge or what have you researched about India and Indian Education System which makes you feel that studying in India would help you achieve your dreams?*
30/01/24, 11:06 am - +263 77 853 3959: I understand that India has so many esteemed Universities and Colleges the likes of Delhi University, Mysore University and many more. These universities are known for producing the best future for the students and l would be much delighted to be molded the same. Above all India has best moral values that can shape someone into a successful individual.
30/01/24, 11:37 am - Harmehak: I am glad you have awareness, Evas!
30/01/24, 11:37 am - Harmehak: Alright please, let me add to it, you see over the past 6 years, the Edoofa Scholarship Program is only focused in India, because of the following reasons:

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
30/01/24, 12:22 pm - Harmehak: Are we connected, Evas?
30/01/24, 12:22 pm - +263 77 853 3959: unfortunate me or my family members might not be aware of the actual costs involved save to say they are like to be high
30/01/24, 12:22 pm - Harmehak: I understand!
30/01/24, 12:23 pm - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
30/01/24, 12:23 pm - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
30/01/24, 12:23 pm - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
30/01/24, 12:23 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
30/01/24, 12:25 pm - +263 77 853 3959: Noted ma'am
30/01/24, 12:25 pm - Harmehak: In simple words Evas, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
30/01/24, 12:26 pm - Harmehak: However as per my experience, I can share with you that *if you are able to perform and clear all these criteria with a high passing grade, you would be eligible for higher quantum of Scholarship*, in which you will just have to pay a minimal fee of *$1200-$1800*, Which would cover your entire fees be it food, accommodation, Tuition etc.

What are your thoughts on the same?
30/01/24, 12:28 pm - +263 77 853 3959: Noted ma'am
30/01/24, 12:34 pm - +263 77 853 3959: I take note of the amounts involved.. will that be a one time payment or you pay per semester.
30/01/24, 12:39 pm - Harmehak: Let me help you have a better clarity regarding the same.
30/01/24, 12:40 pm - +263 77 853 3959: Noted  ma'am
30/01/24, 12:41 pm - Harmehak: Now you see Evas, the amazing aspect about this is that the annual fee of the student which includes the remaining cost of tuition fees, food and accommodation expenses will have to be paid in semester wise which would be in installments of 6 months each that too after the student arrives at the University.

So for example, if after the scholarship the annual fee of the student comes to be let us say $1800, now to the University it has to be paid Semester Wise ( 2 Installments of 6 months each). Therefore it is paid like $900 in the first semester and $900 in the next semester, but there would be the Earn While You Learn Program which would help the student in reducing the semester fee as well.

Usually what parents do is, since after arriving in India students do get an Indian Bank Account opened, parents can also deposit the fee on a monthly basis into the students account and the student in one go can complete the semester fee after the interval of 6 months itself!
30/01/24, 12:49 pm - +263 77 853 3959: Noted ma'am
30/01/24, 12:52 pm - Harmehak: So far, do you have any queries please?
30/01/24, 12:53 pm - +263 77 853 3959: No ma'am
30/01/24, 12:53 pm - Harmehak: Alright please
30/01/24, 12:53 pm - Harmehak: Evas, from his experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,

While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time. 

This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year. 

Wouldn't you agree to the same?
30/01/24, 12:54 pm - +263 77 853 3959: Yes
30/01/24, 12:55 pm - +263 77 853 3959: I agree on that
30/01/24, 1:09 pm - Harmehak: So now are you in a better position to relate how Edoofa is making higher education affordable and accessible for international students in India, Evas?
30/01/24, 1:10 pm - +263 77 853 3959: Yes ma'am
30/01/24, 1:11 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

Now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program in detail and how it would assist you.
30/01/24, 1:11 pm - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
30/01/24, 1:11 pm - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
30/01/24, 1:11 pm - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

30/01/24, 1:20 pm - Harmehak: Did you thoroughly follow the discussion, Evas?
30/01/24, 1:22 pm - +263 77 853 3959: Yes ma'am
30/01/24, 1:23 pm - +263 77 853 3959: So ma'am during my course l will be able to have some time to do other businesses.
30/01/24, 1:27 pm - Harmehak: You cannot work in India on a student visa please.
30/01/24, 1:27 pm - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $1800 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$600 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $50-$60 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
30/01/24, 1:27 pm - +263 77 853 3959: Oky noted

30/01/24, 1:36 pm - +263 77 853 3959: From our side our costs are on the higher side and would appreciate a fully funded scholarship program.
30/01/24, 1:37 pm - Harmehak: Evas, did you follow when we earlier discussed regarding Edoofa offering Scholarship and Not Sponsorship?
30/01/24, 1:37 pm - +263 77 853 3959: Yes l did

30/01/24, 1:49 pm - +263 77 853 3959: On financial aspect l will take it as it will be.
30/01/24, 2:04 pm - Harmehak: Can you elaborate and properly address the same, Evas?
30/01/24, 2:08 pm - +263 77 853 3959: Ma'am if am able to Earn while am learning it would assist so much.

30/01/24, 2:34 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate!
30/01/24, 2:34 pm - +263 77 853 3959: Thank you

30/01/24, 2:36 pm - +263 77 853 3959: Yed l did ma'am
30/01/24, 2:43 pm - Harmehak: That is great, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes. 

Are you ready?
30/01/24, 2:44 pm - +263 77 853 3959: Yes
30/01/24, 2:45 pm - Harmehak: Evas, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
30/01/24, 2:45 pm - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
30/01/24, 2:57 pm - +263 77 853 3959: 1500 to 2000
30/01/24, 2:58 pm - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
30/01/24, 2:58 pm - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
30/01/24, 2:58 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
30/01/24, 3:00 pm - +263 77 853 3959: Oky noted ma'am
30/01/24, 3:01 pm - +263 77 853 3959: So if l apply February intake it's 350
30/01/24, 3:12 pm - +263 77 853 3959: Ma'am are you there
30/01/24, 3:38 pm - Harmehak: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
30/01/24, 3:38 pm - Harmehak: Excuse me for the delay due to a technical glitch
30/01/24, 3:45 pm - +263 77 853 3959: Noted
30/01/24, 3:48 pm - +263 77 853 3959: Yes l do
30/01/24, 3:48 pm - Harmehak: That's amazing, so now that you have understood how Edoofa makes the application process affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
30/01/24, 3:48 pm - Harmehak: Now as you can see, because of such an amazing opportunity that Edoofa provides to its students, Edoofa receives thousands of applications on a  daily basis out of which Eligibility Evaluation takes place as I did share with you above, so only if the student is found eligible for the program and get their Acceptance Letter, *they will have to pay the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Acceptance Letter after which they start with their admission process and the Earn While You Learn Program.*
30/01/24, 3:48 pm - Harmehak: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
30/01/24, 3:49 pm - +263 77 853 3959: Noted
30/01/24, 3:49 pm - +263 77 853 3959: Oky ma'am
30/01/24, 3:52 pm - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
30/01/24, 3:52 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
30/01/24, 3:52 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in their country itself.
30/01/24, 3:52 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
30/01/24, 3:56 pm - +263 77 853 3959: I understood ma'am go on
30/01/24, 3:57 pm - Harmehak: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
30/01/24, 3:57 pm - Harmehak: Basically, this registration fee ($500-$1000) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024-2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
30/01/24, 3:57 pm - Harmehak: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*

Here is a picture of the Visa of one of the Edoofian who arrived in India, for 2023 Academic Intake.

30/01/24, 4:02 pm - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.

30/01/24, 4:19 pm - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
30/01/24, 4:19 pm - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
30/01/24, 4:19 pm - Harmehak: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

Your scholarship journey is reaching a crucial juncture. *Tomorrow on “31-01-23” at 11:30 A.M. CAT,* I will meticulously evaluate your application. This session is not just about answering your questions; it includes a vital Eligibility Check Interview.

We strongly recommend parents/guardians join, recognizing that higher education is a family decision. Prepare for a series of interviews, marking a significant phase in finalizing your scholarship application. As your counselor, I wish you the very best. It's been a pleasure guiding you through your career sessions.

If you qualify for the interview, we would proceed ahead and we look forward to welcoming you to India. Please be proactive, as everyone's time is valuable. The Senior Counselor and Director will make decisions based on your interview and adhere strictly to the given time. Follow instructions diligently, and if the session is completed within the allotted time, your application will proceed.

Happy Family Discussion!
Stay Blessed!
