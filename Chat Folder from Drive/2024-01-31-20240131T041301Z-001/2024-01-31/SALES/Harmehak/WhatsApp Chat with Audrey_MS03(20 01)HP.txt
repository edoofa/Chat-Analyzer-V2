22/01/24, 1:42 pm - Harmehak: Very well put across!

Let me provide you with the details regarding how pursuing geography here in India, can help you pursue a career related to both GIS and Agriculture, Audrey!
22/01/24, 1:44 pm - Harmehak: A Bachelor in Geography degree can provide a solid foundation for a career in the field of geology. Some of the common career paths for Geography graduates with an interest in geology include:

Geologist: Study the physical characteristics and processes of the Earth, including its rocks, minerals, and oil and gas resources.

Environmental Geologist: Assess and manage the impact of human activities on the environment, such as the impact of mining and oil and gas extraction.

Hydrogeologist: Study the distribution and movement of water underground and on the surface of the Earth.

Petroleum Geologist: Explore for and evaluate oil and gas reserves.

Mining Geologist: Plan and supervise the extraction of minerals and other geological resources.

Geographical Information Systems (GIS) Specialist: Use computer software to analyze and visualize geographical data, including geological data.

Geography Professor/Lecturer: Teach and conduct research in geography and related fields, including geology.

These are just a few examples of careers that a Bachelor in Geography degree combined with an interest in geology can lead to. The exact career path will depend on the individual's interests, skills, and experience.
22/01/24, 1:44 pm - Harmehak: Meanwhile, Geography also plays a crucial role in determining the type of agriculture that can be practiced in a particular region. Factors such as climate, soil type, topography, and water availability all influence the types of crops that can be grown and the farming practices that can be employed.

Additionally, geography also impacts the distribution and transportation of agricultural products, as well as the development of agricultural economies and trade patterns. Understanding the geographical context of agriculture is essential for effective land use planning, resource management, and sustainable agricultural development.

Many geographic factors affect today’s modern agricultural businesses and trade. From climate to key trade and shipping hubs, location has shaped the fortunes of states and agricultural production.

24/01/24, 9:55 am - +263 78 420 2499: Yes
24/01/24, 9:55 am - +263 78 420 2499: Morning
24/01/24, 10:08 am - Harmehak: So were you able to have a discussion with your parents, Audrey?
24/01/24, 12:24 pm - Harmehak: Audrey are you aware of Belinda Dube from your school?
24/01/24, 12:38 pm - +263 78 420 2499: Yes l know her
24/01/24, 12:40 pm - Harmehak: Are you aware that she is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program?
24/01/24, 12:40 pm - +263 78 420 2499: Yes am aware
24/01/24, 12:42 pm - Harmehak: That's great!

As of now, may I know the reason behind your inactive participation?
24/01/24, 12:46 pm - +263 78 420 2499: They  is no reason
24/01/24, 12:50 pm - Harmehak: Kindly address the same in that case, Audrey!
24/01/24, 12:51 pm - +263 78 420 2499: Yes
24/01/24, 12:57 pm - Harmehak: As of now do you have any queries?
24/01/24, 12:58 pm - +263 78 420 2499: I don't have
24/01/24, 12:59 pm - Harmehak: Did you thoroughly go through the shared resources and information, Audrey?
24/01/24, 12:59 pm - +263 78 420 2499: Yes l did
24/01/24, 1:03 pm - Harmehak: How do you believe studying in India would help you build a promising future, Audrey?
24/01/24, 1:57 pm - +263 78 420 2499: Its because India the quality  of education  in lndia is high
24/01/24, 1:58 pm - Harmehak: I am glad you could learn more the same from the shared resources.

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
24/01/24, 1:59 pm - +263 78 420 2499: We are not familiar with it
24/01/24, 1:59 pm - Harmehak: Alright please!
24/01/24, 1:59 pm - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
24/01/24, 1:59 pm - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
24/01/24, 1:59 pm - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
24/01/24, 1:59 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
24/01/24, 2:04 pm - +263 78 420 2499: I understand
24/01/24, 2:04 pm - Harmehak: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $2000-3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, 

Now *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

What are you thoughts on the same please?
24/01/24, 2:15 pm - +263 78 420 2499: I think its an excellent way to provide financial  assistance  to students who have a potential  to succeed  and l also think its a great way to motivate students and encourage  them to pursue their academic goals
24/01/24, 2:15 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate your thorough acknowledgement for the same, Audrey!
24/01/24, 2:16 pm - Harmehak: Audrey, Senior Academician Mr Piyush were in Zimbabwe for about 90 days, from his experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,

While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time. 

This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year. 

Wouldn't you agree to the same?
24/01/24, 2:20 pm - +263 78 420 2499: Yes l agree
24/01/24, 2:21 pm - Harmehak: So now are you in an even better position to relate how Edoofa is making higher education affordable and accessible for international students in India, Audrey?
24/01/24, 2:22 pm - +263 78 420 2499: Yess
24/01/24, 2:23 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

Now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program in detail and how it would assist you.
24/01/24, 2:23 pm - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
24/01/24, 2:23 pm - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
24/01/24, 2:23 pm - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

24/01/24, 2:32 pm - +263 78 420 2499: I understand
24/01/24, 2:33 pm - Harmehak: So what's your take on the Earn While You Learn Program and the importance of it, Audrey?
24/01/24, 2:39 pm - +263 78 420 2499: It helps to gain work experiences  while am still in school.it also help to cover the cost of  the education  and it also help to understand  connection  between  learning and the real  world
24/01/24, 2:40 pm - Harmehak: Very correct and well put across, Audrey!
24/01/24, 2:40 pm - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
24/01/24, 2:55 pm - +263 78 420 2499: Oh ohk l understand
24/01/24, 3:01 pm - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

24/01/24, 3:08 pm - +263 78 420 2499: Wooow this sounds interesting
24/01/24, 3:09 pm - Harmehak: That is great, 

So Audrey, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes. 

Are you ready?
24/01/24, 3:11 pm - +263 78 420 2499: Yes am ready
24/01/24, 3:12 pm - Harmehak: Audrey, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
24/01/24, 3:12 pm - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
24/01/24, 3:15 pm - +263 78 420 2499: $1 500 _ $2 250
24/01/24, 3:16 pm - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
24/01/24, 3:16 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
24/01/24, 3:17 pm - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
24/01/24, 3:18 pm - +263 78 420 2499: Thats better    and it will assist  my parents  financially
24/01/24, 3:19 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate please.
24/01/24, 3:19 pm - Harmehak: Audrey, Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
24/01/24, 3:20 pm - +263 78 420 2499: Yes
24/01/24, 3:21 pm - Harmehak: That's amazing, so now that you have understood how Edoofa makes the application process affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
24/01/24, 3:21 pm - Harmehak: Now as you can see, because of such an amazing opportunity that Edoofa provides to its students, Edoofa receives thousands of applications on a  daily basis out of which Eligibility Evaluation takes place as I did share with you above, so only if the student is found eligible for the program and get their Acceptance Letter, *they will have to pay the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Acceptance Letter after which they start with their admission process and the Earn While You Learn Program.*
24/01/24, 3:21 pm - Harmehak: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
24/01/24, 3:23 pm - +263 78 420 2499: Ohk  understood
24/01/24, 3:26 pm - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
24/01/24, 3:26 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
24/01/24, 3:27 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in their country itself.
24/01/24, 3:27 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
24/01/24, 3:29 pm - +263 78 420 2499: Yes understood
24/01/24, 3:30 pm - Harmehak: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
24/01/24, 3:30 pm - Harmehak: Basically, this registration fee ($500-$1000) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024-2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
24/01/24, 3:30 pm - Harmehak: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*

Here is a picture of the Visa of one of the Edoofian who arrived in India, for 2023 Academic Intake.
24/01/24, 3:30 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
24/01/24, 3:33 pm - +263 78 420 2499: Am following
24/01/24, 3:34 pm - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
24/01/24, 3:34 pm - Harmehak: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)
24/01/24, 3:34 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
24/01/24, 3:42 pm - +263 78 420 2499: Ohk noted
24/01/24, 3:42 pm - +263 78 420 2499: I will talk to her
24/01/24, 3:42 pm - Harmehak: Sure please,

Do connect her with your parents too, Audrey!
24/01/24, 3:43 pm - +263 78 420 2499: Ohk l.will
24/01/24, 3:43 pm - Harmehak: Yes please
24/01/24, 3:53 pm - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
24/01/24, 3:53 pm - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
24/01/24, 3:53 pm - Harmehak: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

25/01/24, 11:32 am - Harmehak: So how was your discussion with your parents, Audrey?

What all did you discuss with them?

25/01/24, 11:45 am - +263 78 420 2499: Ohk
25/01/24, 11:45 am - Harmehak: Have you already had the opportunity to connect with Mrs. Ruth? 

You see, her story is truly remarkable. As a single parent, juggling the responsibilities of a small-scale farmer and the mother of two daughters, she has persevered. Her journey with Edoofa is a testament to how dedicated individuals can overcome obstacles.
Mrs. Ruth's experience with Edoofa is a testament to the transformative impact our programs can have. She not only managed her family's needs but also seized the opportunity for her daughters to achieve higher education. The support and guidance she received from Edoofa were instrumental in her success. The process was challenging, yet incredibly rewarding. Mrs. Ruth's determination, combined with Edoofa's assistance, has paved the way for a brighter future.
25/01/24, 11:47 am - +263 78 420 2499: Yes l managed to talk to her  and she told me mor3 about Edoofa
25/01/24, 11:47 am - Harmehak: That's great!
25/01/24, 11:47 am - Harmehak: Okay so in that case, I would like to ask you a few questions, but before that with immense pleasure, I would like to share the glimpses of the Africa Visit of our Founders which took place in June 2023! 

*It was a much-awaited event and they were welcomed by Ministries, Educationalists, Edoofians, and Parents across different African Countries. This is a must-watch video depicting the Acceptance of the Program in the African Continent, especially in Zimbabwe!!*
25/01/24, 11:47 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
25/01/24, 11:56 am - +263 78 420 2499: Ohk l  watched  it
25/01/24, 11:57 am - Harmehak: How was your experience going through the video, Audrey?
25/01/24, 12:07 pm - +263 78 420 2499: I experienced  that the scholarship  had a good impact on the students lives. In the video it also shows that   the Edoofa is going to help the students  achieve their dreams and the students look happy
25/01/24, 12:08 pm - Harmehak: I am delighted to know that!

So are you willing to join this year's event in Zimbabwe along with other Proud Edoofians, Audrey?
25/01/24, 12:08 pm - +263 78 420 2499: Yes am willing
25/01/24, 12:10 pm - Harmehak: That's wonderful!
25/01/24, 12:10 pm - Harmehak: So Audrey, can you tell me:-

1. What is the name of the course which you would be studying through the Edoofa Program?

2. Through Edoofa in which country would you be pursuing your higher education?

7. After receiving your offer letter from the Edoofa Academic Board, you will have to pay your registration fee in order to finalise your university admission and reserve your scholarship seat. This registration fee will be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?

25/01/24, 12:43 pm - Harmehak: Duly received, Audrey.

So did you happen to discuss these details and finances with your parents too?
25/01/24, 12:45 pm - +263 78 420 2499: Yes
25/01/24, 12:46 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

Are they willing to support you for the same, Audrey?

If so, please request them to acknowledge the same using a voice note.
25/01/24, 12:48 pm - +263 77 847 6428: We are willing to support her in the programme
25/01/24, 12:48 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate, can you please acknowledge the same using a voice note?
25/01/24, 12:51 pm - +263 77 847 6428: <Media omitted>
25/01/24, 12:52 pm - Harmehak: Mr Samunda, you see as per my experience over the last couple of years, I have been fortunate to have assisted over hundreds of students in achieving their career aspiration through the Edoofa Program. 

One of my key observations during helping out these students was regarding what was the common trait amongst students who are today having the best of their time in India through the Edoofa Program, and honestly I was able to come down to only one aspect that is FAMILY SUPPORT.
25/01/24, 12:52 pm - Harmehak: You see in this journey of any child's higher education, there are three major contributors 

1. Student himself/herself
2. FAMILY
3. EDOOFA PROGAM

Now all the students who are today successfully a part of the Edoofa Program, had all these three contributors working together towards the common goal which is student's success and ensuring that by the time student completes his/her higher education they should be able to get good paying jobs. 

Even if any one of the contributor does not perform to the best of their abilities, Student's overall success is hampered. Let me give you a few examples

*In the event if student wishes to work hard, Edoofa is willing to support but the Family is not willing to support, the student will not be successful under the program*

*In the event if student wishes to work hard, Family is willing to support, but Edoofa's academic Board doesn't find the student worthy, the student will not be successful under the program*

*In the event if Family is willing to support, Edoofa's Academic Board is willing to support but the student doesn't wishes to work hard, then also the student will not be successful under the program*
25/01/24, 12:52 pm - Harmehak: During the evaluation of your child's application so far, the Academic Board has evaluated a few aspects, such as student's willingness to work hard, and family's willingness to support the student so that the student can achieve what he/she has aspired. However now in your interview ahead, the Academic Board would be strictly be evaluating the Family's support towards the child higher education. 

*As you know in the event if your child is found eligible, you would have to complete a certain part of the formalities within the 7 day timeline, so may I know regarding the same, are you willing to support your child to the fullest?*
25/01/24, 12:59 pm - +263 77 847 6428: We are willing to support her
25/01/24, 1:00 pm - Harmehak: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
25/01/24, 1:00 pm - Harmehak: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
25/01/24, 1:00 pm - Harmehak: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.
25/01/24, 1:00 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
25/01/24, 1:00 pm - Harmehak: Ideally as you know, the tentative dates:

1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 30th or 31st January 2024 for $200 and the 27th or 28st of February for the remaining $150.

2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 30th or 31st January 2024. 

Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?
25/01/24, 1:06 pm - +263 77 847 6428: I will for the first option.dont woŕry iam fully behind my child 100%
25/01/24, 1:08 pm - Harmehak: I thoroughly appreciate your support for Audrey!

So now as we will be proceeding for the further stage that is interview with the Program Director for the parents as well as Audrey.

25/01/24, 1:08 pm - Harmehak: Shall I reserve the same please?

25/01/24, 4:10 pm - +263 78 420 2499: <Media omitted>
25/01/24, 4:10 pm - Harmehak: In the interview group please
26/01/24, 10:50 am - Harmehak: Good Morning, I hope you are doing well!

26/01/24, 10:51 am - Harmehak: I am doing well please!
26/01/24, 10:51 am - Harmehak: Heartiest congratulations, Dear parents and Audrey, as your application was found eligible for the Edoofa Scholarship Program. I have been so happy and excited myself when I saw you passed the eligibility check stage 👏🏽👏🏽.

As the results have been officially conveyed by the Academic Board via email, it is essential to acknowledge them. Furthermore, for your convenience, we have attached the Acceptance Letter from the Board to this group.

You are supposed to acknowledge the result via Email and go through your Acceptance Letter properly. Did you do the same?
26/01/24, 10:52 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
26/01/24, 10:57 am - +263 77 847 6428: Waaaal thank you thank u so much💃💃💃💃💃
26/01/24, 11:10 am - +263 78 420 2499: 💃💃 yes  am so happy  thank  you  so.much
26/01/24, 11:13 am - Harmehak: You're very welcome Mrs Mavis and Audrey!👏
26/01/24, 12:16 pm - +263 77 847 6428: Will send the enrolment fee via Mr N Maposa
26/01/24, 3:13 pm - Harmehak: Shall I brief you about the payment mode in that case.
26/01/24, 3:13 pm - +263 77 847 6428: Ok maam.go ahead
26/01/24, 3:14 pm - Harmehak: You see in the first mode, the Direct Bank Transfer Mode, the transfer charges which are to be borne by the parents of the student ranges between $100 to $120 which become quite high for a lot of parents considering the economic situation in Zimbabwe itself. So as not every student is in a position to cater for an additional $100 to $120 just as transfer charge, the second mode was introduced, wherein, it is the Bank deposit in Mr. Maposa's Account, in this the transfer charges get divided amongst 10 students resulting in an equivalent bearing of 12.5% at the end.

So as you can see in the letter that there is a Bank deposit in, Mr. Needmore Maposa of Chibuwe High School's account as he is our Associated Partner there in Zimbabwe, His daughter is studying in India through the Edoofa Program and from his school over 30 students are studying in India under the Edoofa Program.
26/01/24, 3:14 pm - Harmehak: The fee payment can also be made through Chibuwe High. School Principal himself. Since his account is a NOSTRO Account which only holds USD itself, therefore the necessary amount including the transfer charges in this mode itself would be $394 ($350 + $44 transfer charges), and the same details are as below:-

BANK NAME: FBC
