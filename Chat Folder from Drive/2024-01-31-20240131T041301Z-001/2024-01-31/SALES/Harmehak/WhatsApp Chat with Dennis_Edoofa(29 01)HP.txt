29/01/24, 1:54 pm - Harmehak: I feel you too are looking for something like this, so that just like these students you can cater for your higher education by your own self and help your parents reduce their financial burden, isn't it?

I would like to know you better as a student so please go ahead, tell me a bit about yourself, your education, along with what do you wish to study, your strengths and weaknesses, and your hobbies, since I honestly don't know a lot about you?

And with that a detailed description of your family background, what do your parents do *(Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work)?*, what is their highest education level along with if you have any siblings, please?
29/01/24, 5:08 pm - +263 78 220 3030: I am Dennis Chando, a 21 year old man. I am a young man with an ambition to become great, someone who is dedicated to achieve special goals in life.
Academically i had been strong all the way around from my primary to my secondary level. I had limited room for failure, i turned my failures into mistakes so i learned out of them. I had to attain 4As and 4Bs at my Ordinary level, and i tried my best also at Advanced level..
I would like to put my all at Business management.i have faith as a strength, i dont let my fears stop me.

I am from a family of 5. I am the only male, for i am between 2 girls. My father is jobless whilst my mother is a maid in South Africa
29/01/24, 9:07 pm - Harmehak: I was hoping we could connect earlier, however I would be scheduling your session for *tomorrow at 9:30 AM CAT*, as my working hours for the day are over and it's already been a long day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*

30/01/24, 9:42 am - +263 78 220 3030: Um doing great, thank u
30/01/24, 9:42 am - +263 78 220 3030: Yes we can start
30/01/24, 9:49 am - Harmehak: Well received and well expressed Dennis, Its a pleasure to know about you and your family!

I appreciate the honesty and transparency you have shown in expressing yourself!

May I know more about your siblings?
30/01/24, 9:54 am - +263 78 220 3030: Ok, i have 2 siblings. My elder sister is 25 and happily married and the last of us is 17, she's still at her high school level.
30/01/24, 10:05 am - Harmehak: Alright please!
30/01/24, 10:05 am - Harmehak: Well Dennis now as we proceed ahead, I would like to your thoughts on higher education abroad!

Do you believe it's a life changing decision?
30/01/24, 10:24 am - +263 78 220 3030: I do believe in it, for it is associated with adventurous and life changing activities.
... Higher education abroad is of assured quality and it really helps afterwards.
Education abroad  better than being in here Especially in here, for abroad there is international standardized education, even the facilities are far much improved to meet international requirements. 
Studing abroad is like a dreamed coming true, for i always wanted to attain the best education.
30/01/24, 10:33 am - Harmehak: You see, Dennis, Senior Academician Mr. Piyush was in Zimbabwe for about 90 days. He had the privilege of meeting many Zimbabwean students who had applied for the Edoofa Program back in 2018-2019. However, at that time, they didn't proceed because they were enticed by the prospect of earning quick money in the country. This year, when they met him, they shared how difficult things have been for them. Some of them, despite holding reputed degrees from UZ, MSU, and HIT, are working as petrol attendants, while others have started careers as mobile/laptop repair technicians. Some were facing even more challenges, resorting to selling Ecocash, Simcards, or vegetables.

Observing this scenario, Mr. Piyush saw many of them regretting not seizing the opportunity when they had the chance. So, what you are sharing, I can understand that, in reality, things are much more challenging over there.
30/01/24, 10:38 am - +263 78 220 3030: Here things are so challenging, u can get your degree here but you will not get wat you had learned for
30/01/24, 10:48 am - Harmehak: I can understand!
30/01/24, 10:49 am - Harmehak: So would you add that you are mentally prepared for a life abroad too, Dennis?
30/01/24, 10:54 am - +263 78 220 3030: Yeah i am mentally prepared, so as  physical me
30/01/24, 11:05 am - Harmehak: Dennis, I am delighted to see your dedication and I believe you would agree with me that commitment from your parents is equally important!

So now could you please share, if your family members are aware of your plans to study abroad and if they are willing to support your higher education abroad mentally and financially?
30/01/24, 11:20 am - +263 78 220 3030: My family members are aware of it, they are also ready to stretch their hands in helping me with all that is required so that i can get higher and better education abroad
30/01/24, 11:50 am - Harmehak: I appreciate please!

May I know who would be the one supporting you financially and what profession they are in, Dennis?
30/01/24, 12:34 pm - +263 78 220 3030: My mother, she's a house maid in South Africa. She had been supportive though all my education since my primary levels.. But now my elder sister has been giving a hand too she sells clothes, she owns a small shop
30/01/24, 12:44 pm - Harmehak: I do understand,

Did you happen to communicate the same with them as well, Dennis?
30/01/24, 12:45 pm - +263 78 220 3030: Yes i did and they indicated that they are willing to stand with me
