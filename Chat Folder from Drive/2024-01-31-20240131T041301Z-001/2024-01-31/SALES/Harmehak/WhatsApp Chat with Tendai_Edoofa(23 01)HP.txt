24/01/24, 2:02 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate your efforts.
24/01/24, 2:02 pm - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!
24/01/24, 2:04 pm - +263 78 603 0160: Yes im confident
24/01/24, 2:05 pm - Harmehak: That's great Mrs Stancia,

24/01/24, 2:17 pm - Harmehak: Alright please.
24/01/24, 2:17 pm - Harmehak: Is she currently a Lower 6 or an Upper 6 student please?
24/01/24, 2:21 pm - +263 78 603 0160: She is an upper 6
24/01/24, 2:25 pm - Harmehak: Duly noted!

*2) Lawyer*
As is evident by the title, is a person whose profession is law. There are different specializations for law including Cyber law, Environmental law, Company law, Criminal law and Family Law.

They then go on to represent and defend their clients in the court.

*3) Public Prosecutor*

The criminal procedure code of 1973 under section 24, outlines the arrangements concerning the Public Prosecutor.

*4) Judge*

*5) Company Secretary*
This job is for students who want to work in the corporate sector. This job requires a degree from ICSI or the Institute of Company secretaries of India. A lot of dedication and hard work is required to complete this course with your law degree, but on successful completion, this career can be extremely rewarding.

*Required Skill-Set for BA LLB*
It is rightly said that learning is an on – going process and this holds true especially in the aspect of personal and professional development.

*Good Written Communication*– Writing forms a major part of the work in in the legal profession. The written communication involves letters, documents, notices, and so on. The documents must be grammatically correct and error free. This requires a good level of English proficiency.

*Good Verbal Communication*– A lot depends on how well the legal professional can express his or her case, arguments and generally converse with clients and authorities. Good verbal communication ensures good expression and understanding which are crucial for a successful career in law.

*Good Time Management*– In the legal profession, time management is very crucial. The art of delegating tasks, working within deadlines, and prioritizing tasks to achieve success is very essential.

*A great degree of self-confidence*– This profession needs a high degree of self-confidence to win the clients’ trust. A strong belief in yourself will go a long way in winning arguments and cases.

*An analytical mind and good research skills*– A case with proper research and well-reasoned out and evaluated argument stands a very high chance of success.

*High EQ (Emotional Quotient)*– Individuals in the legal profession, especially lawyers, must learn to be empathetic.

*Tech Savvy*– In the rapidly developing and evolving technological world, they must be abreast of the latest technology to understand and use it, as and when needed. They need to use technology to their advantage to improve their efficiency and chances of success.

*Good Commercial awareness*– This is not only restricted to being aware of the current trends and technology, prevalent in the world of business and law, but also being aware of the developments in the world of business and law, both nationally and globally.

*A high degree of patience*– This is a much needed skill, since you deal with different types of people and some cases and procedures stretch over a period of time which need a lot of patience and careful handling.

*Team player skills*– Since a legal professional will deal with a lot of people therefore to be effective they need to bond with people. The art of getting work done and obtaining information though networking and working with people helps in attaining the objectives.

25/01/24, 11:51 am - +263 78 603 0160: I understand that so i see that india is higher in education i will be more appreciate when my child get a degree there
25/01/24, 11:51 am - Harmehak: I am glad this intrigued you and you found it helpful, Mrs Stancia.

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
25/01/24, 11:56 am - +263 78 603 0160: We are okay with it coz if a child get a higher education it will help us too so with any cost we will try to solve it
25/01/24, 11:59 am - Harmehak: I appreciate please.
25/01/24, 11:59 am - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
25/01/24, 12:00 pm - +263 78 603 0160: Okay i appreciate please so me as a parent how much would i be going to pay
25/01/24, 12:04 pm - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
25/01/24, 12:04 pm - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
25/01/24, 12:04 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
25/01/24, 12:07 pm - +263 78 603 0160: Okay thats great
25/01/24, 12:07 pm - Harmehak: In simple words Mrs Stancia, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
25/01/24, 12:07 pm - Harmehak: However as per my experience, I can share with you that *if she is able to perform and clear all these criteria with a high passing grade, she would be eligible for higher quantum of Scholarship*, in which you will just have to pay a minimal fee of *$1200-$1800*, Which would cover your entire fees be it food, accommodation, Tuition etc.
25/01/24, 12:10 pm - +263 78 603 0160: So what will be the higher grades
25/01/24, 12:13 pm - Harmehak: She can qualify for the same if she performs well in her current evaluation for the scholarship as well as later on in her A level results.
25/01/24, 12:14 pm - +263 78 603 0160: Okay thank you i understand
25/01/24, 12:16 pm - Harmehak: So far, do you have any queries please?
25/01/24, 12:17 pm - +263 78 603 0160: No i dont have
25/01/24, 12:17 pm - Harmehak: Alright please!
25/01/24, 12:17 pm - Harmehak: Mrs Stancia, Senior Academician Mr Piyush were in Zimbabwe for about 90 days, from his experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,

While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time. 

This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year. 

Wouldn't you agree to the same?
25/01/24, 12:20 pm - +263 78 603 0160: Yes i agreed 100%
25/01/24, 12:24 pm - Harmehak: Indeed, so now are you in a better position to relate how Edoofa is making higher education affordable and accessible for international students in India, Mrs Stancia?
25/01/24, 12:57 pm - Harmehak: @263786030160

25/01/24, 2:59 pm - Harmehak: Have you followed the discussion so far, Mrs Stancia?
