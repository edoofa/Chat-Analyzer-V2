18/01/24, 3:00 pm - Harmehak: Alright so Mr Sanyanga, before we proceed ahead, I would like to know you and Mrs Nompilo better as parents. 

Kindly go ahead, share a bit with us about yourself, what do you do, what is your highest qualification, and what motivates you to support your child ahead for education?
18/01/24, 3:17 pm - +263 77 237 4241: My lovely wife Nompilo Sanyanga is a primary school teacher.
She holds a diploma in teaching and is currently finalizing her BSc Hons degree in Counseling with the Zimbabwe Open University (ZOU)
After graduating she taught at Mt Selinda Primary School from 2005 to 2011.
Currently she is teaching  at Beitbridge Primary School in Beitbridge Matebeleland South.
I, Stanley Emmanuel Sanyanga,am also a civil servant (Immigration Officer) within the Home affairs Ministry.
I hold the following qualifications 
1) Diploma in Security Management (Unisa)
2) Advanced Diploma in Security Management (Unisa)
3) Post graduate Diploma in Security Management (Unisa)
My wife and I own a 15 hectare plot in Chipinge and our son  has vested interest in agriculture specifically agronomy and dairy.
The scholarship thus would greatly enhance our son to run this plot in the near future (generational wealth).
Thank you.
18/01/24, 3:21 pm - Harmehak: Well received and well expressed Mr Sanyanga, Its a pleasure to know about you and your family!

I appreciate the honesty and transparency you have shown in expressing yourself!

It's great to that you are leading a family that greatly values education, having pursued higher education yourself and Mrs Nompilo being a teacher is the perfect example.
18/01/24, 3:24 pm - +263 77 237 4241: Thank you so much and may God continue to bless you with your good programs which are helping a lot of people in Africa.
18/01/24, 3:26 pm - Harmehak: You're very welcome,

I appreciate your kind words!
18/01/24, 3:27 pm - Harmehak: This message was deleted
18/01/24, 3:47 pm - Harmehak: Mr Stanley, I would like to know Emmanuel better as a student.

How he is at school, his interests and hobbies.

Like you mentioned I can see he opted to pursue sciences.

Kindly share his O and A level results as well. <This message was edited>
18/01/24, 4:14 pm - +263 77 237 4241: Well, Emmanuel is an average student but very persistent on his goals.
He managed to score 6 ordinary level passes.
At A level he managed to score points with a good pass in Crop science which all along had been his ultimate prize for him to proceed to university level with the same program.
Emmanuel likes sports.
He was in the school's team of rugby.
Besides rugby,he also enjoys basketball,perhaps owing to his height.
He is also a fanatic supporter of soccer in particular Manchester United.
Like most youths,he also enjoys music.
However every Sunday he joins the family for church service (RCZ) and he rarely misses that.
18/01/24, 4:21 pm - Harmehak: Well expressed Mr Sanyanga!

It's a pleasure to know about Emmanuel, he definitely seems to be a great personality!
18/01/24, 4:21 pm - Harmehak: May I know about his A level results please? <This message was edited>
18/01/24, 4:22 pm - +263 77 237 4241: Crop Science B
Geography.     D
Biology.           0
18/01/24, 4:23 pm - Harmehak: I can see he didn't score that well in Biology, which happens to be a crucial subject if a student wishes to study Agriculture in India,

May I know more about the same please? <This message was edited>
18/01/24, 4:29 pm - +263 77 237 4241: You mean more about Biology or the candidate?
18/01/24, 4:30 pm - Harmehak: His results as he didn't clear Biology please,

What is your take on the same?
18/01/24, 4:34 pm - Harmehak added +263 77 359 7399
18/01/24, 4:35 pm - Harmehak: It is a pleasure to connect with you today, Mrs Nompilo.

You can address me as *Ms. Harmehak and we do have with us, Mr. Piyush who is the Head of Counseling and Mr. Jyotishman who is the Head of Admissions* and will be evaluating your responses for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
18/01/24, 4:38 pm - +263 77 237 4241: I will have to enquire from him on whether he wants to re-write, proceed as status quo or follow a different career path.
18/01/24, 4:40 pm - +263 77 359 7399: Greetings Ms Hermehak and Mr Piyush. Thank you for group invite.
18/01/24, 4:41 pm - Harmehak: I do understand please.

If he would rewrite, that would happen by when please?
18/01/24, 4:41 pm - Harmehak: You're very welcome
18/01/24, 4:42 pm - +263 77 237 4241: Most probably end of this year
18/01/24, 4:46 pm - Harmehak: While I completely understand what you are sharing, 

Don't you believe this will lead to him taking a gap year?
18/01/24, 4:46 pm - Harmehak: While he can opt for other great degrees using the current results.
18/01/24, 4:48 pm - +263 77 237 4241: Yes,let me talk to him first,
Maybe he will try the June registration
18/01/24, 4:52 pm - Harmehak: He can definitely do so.

So what other fields as per you can be a great option for him considering his subjects or interests?
18/01/24, 5:07 pm - +263 77 237 4241: BSc Hons in Crop Science
18/01/24, 5:08 pm - +263 77 237 4241: Or Geology
18/01/24, 5:10 pm - Harmehak: While I understand, here in India, Crop science is studied under Bachelor of Science in Agriculture and the same requires Biology.

While let me help you with Geology!
18/01/24, 5:11 pm - Harmehak: A Bachelor in Geography degree can provide a solid foundation for a career in the field of geology. Some of the common career paths for Geography graduates with an interest in geology include:

Geologist: Study the physical characteristics and processes of the Earth, including its rocks, minerals, and oil and gas resources.

Environmental Geologist: Assess and manage the impact of human activities on the environment, such as the impact of mining and oil and gas extraction.

Hydrogeologist: Study the distribution and movement of water underground and on the surface of the Earth.

Petroleum Geologist: Explore for and evaluate oil and gas reserves.

Mining Geologist: Plan and supervise the extraction of minerals and other geological resources.

Geographical Information Systems (GIS) Specialist: Use computer software to analyze and visualize geographical data, including geological data.

Geography Professor/Lecturer: Teach and conduct research in geography and related fields, including geology.

These are just a few examples of careers that a Bachelor in Geography degree combined with an interest in geology can lead to. The exact career path will depend on the individual's interests, skills, and experience.
18/01/24, 5:15 pm - +263 77 237 4241: Thank you so much so a BSc in Geology will suffice (Petroleum Geology)
18/01/24, 5:16 pm - Harmehak: Meanwhile, Geography also plays a crucial role in determining the type of agriculture that can be practiced in a particular region. Factors such as climate, soil type, topography, and water availability all influence the types of crops that can be grown and the farming practices that can be employed.

Additionally, geography also impacts the distribution and transportation of agricultural products, as well as the development of agricultural economies and trade patterns. Understanding the geographical context of agriculture is essential for effective land use planning, resource management, and sustainable agricultural development.

Many geographic factors affect today’s modern agricultural businesses and trade. From climate to key trade and shipping hubs, location has shaped the fortunes of states and agricultural production.
18/01/24, 5:22 pm - Harmehak: Now, Mr Sanyanga, going through the same did you happen to realise how *Bachelors in Geography* is related to both the fields that is- *Geology and Agriculture?*
18/01/24, 5:25 pm - +263 77 237 4241: Yes I do now.
Thank you for the eye opener
18/01/24, 5:25 pm - Harmehak: You're very welcome please!

So far, do you have any queries for me?

You are free to share any inputs as well.
18/01/24, 5:31 pm - +263 77 237 4241: So far so good.
The best option for him is a BSc in Geology.
18/01/24, 5:34 pm - Harmehak: Yes please, Mr Sanyanga.
18/01/24, 5:35 pm - Harmehak: However are you clear that in India, students pursue Bachelors in Geography for the same like I shared earlier?
18/01/24, 5:35 pm - +263 77 237 4241: We will take that.
Wish us luck kkkkk
18/01/24, 5:37 pm - Harmehak: I definitely wish you all luck.

We look forward to having you as a part of the Edoofa Program like other students from Mt Selinda.

Mr Sanyanga, are you aware that the child of Deputy Head of Mt Selinda is also a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program?
18/01/24, 5:37 pm - +263 77 237 4241: I hope so,we will do more research on that.
Thank you 🙏
18/01/24, 5:38 pm - Harmehak: Yes please!

I myself happened to counsel The application of the child of Deputy Head like I am currently counseling Emmanuel's application.
18/01/24, 5:42 pm - Harmehak: So as of now, let me brief you about Bachelors in Geography!
18/01/24, 5:43 pm - +263 77 237 4241: It is good to hear

18/01/24, 6:04 pm - +263 77 237 4241: Noted
18/01/24, 6:06 pm - Harmehak: Wonderful

So Mr Sanyanga, now as we proceed ahead with the remaining discussion, I am sure you might have a question in mind, what exactly are the reasons due to which Edoofa Recommends India as a higher education platform?

18/01/24, 6:57 pm - Harmehak: I was hoping we could continue, however, I would be scheduling your session for *tomorrow at 9:30 AM CAT*, as my working hours for the day are over and it's already been a long day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.
18/01/24, 6:59 pm - Harmehak: Do go through the shared video to learn more about the experience of our Proud Edoofians!
18/01/24, 6:59 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
19/01/24, 9:30 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
19/01/24, 9:32 am - +263 77 237 4241: Ok
19/01/24, 9:38 am - Harmehak: Have you followed the discussion so far, Mr Sanyanga?
19/01/24, 9:38 am - +263 77 237 4241: Yea
19/01/24, 9:42 am - Harmehak: That's great,

What is your take on the resources shared regarding India?
19/01/24, 10:03 am - +263 77 237 4241: I think they are great and very conducive.
19/01/24, 10:03 am - Harmehak: I am glad this intrigued you and you found it helpful, Mr Sanyanga.

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
19/01/24, 10:04 am - +263 77 237 4241: No
19/01/24, 10:06 am - Harmehak: Alright please
19/01/24, 10:06 am - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
19/01/24, 10:08 am - +263 77 237 4241: Noted with thanks
19/01/24, 10:15 am - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
19/01/24, 10:15 am - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
19/01/24, 10:15 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
19/01/24, 10:24 am - Harmehak: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $2000-3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, 

Now *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

What are you thoughts on the same please?
19/01/24, 10:30 am - +263 77 237 4241: I think it's great
19/01/24, 10:31 am - Harmehak: I appreciate.
19/01/24, 10:31 am - Harmehak: Mr Sanyanga, Senior Academician Mr Piyush were in Zimbabwe for about 90 days, from his experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,

While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time. 

This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year. 

Wouldn't you agree to the same?
19/01/24, 10:47 am - +263 77 237 4241: I agree
19/01/24, 10:51 am - Harmehak: Indeed,

So Mr Sanyanga, now are you in a better position to relate how Edoofa is making higher education affordable and accessible for international students in India, Mr Sanyanga?
19/01/24, 10:52 am - +263 77 237 4241: Yes
19/01/24, 10:56 am - Harmehak: That's great,

Now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program in detail and how it would assist you.
19/01/24, 10:56 am - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
19/01/24, 10:56 am - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
19/01/24, 10:56 am - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

19/01/24, 10:56 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
19/01/24, 11:33 am - Harmehak: I believe by now you have a great clarity on how the Earn While You Learn Program would be of great help to students as well parents?
19/01/24, 2:06 pm - +263 77 237 4241: Yes indeed
19/01/24, 2:10 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate!
19/01/24, 2:10 pm - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
19/01/24, 2:22 pm - Harmehak: Dear parents and Emmanuel!

So far do you have any queries for me?

@263771307290 @263773597399 @263772374241
19/01/24, 2:27 pm - +263 77 237 4241: Quite satisfied so far
19/01/24, 2:28 pm - Harmehak: Alright, Mr Sanyanga.

So did you also happen to connect with Emmanuel regarding the course?
19/01/24, 2:29 pm - +263 77 237 4241: Yes
19/01/24, 2:31 pm - Harmehak: Did he happen to have any queries, Mr Sanyanga?
19/01/24, 2:35 pm - +263 77 359 7399: We are following and learning a lot from what you have shared with us.
19/01/24, 2:36 pm - Harmehak: I am glad to know that please.

Feel free to participate and share any queries you might have.
19/01/24, 2:37 pm - +263 77 359 7399: My apologies, I could not respond much since I had a busy schedule at work.
19/01/24, 2:38 pm - Harmehak: I completely understand please.
19/01/24, 2:38 pm - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

19/01/24, 2:49 pm - +263 77 359 7399: Ok. That is great to know that student can also earn while they learn and help towards their fees and upkeep.
19/01/24, 2:50 pm - Harmehak: Yes please, Mrs Nompilo.

Along with earning credits they also get to learn skills!
19/01/24, 2:52 pm - Harmehak: This message was deleted
19/01/24, 2:53 pm - +263 77 359 7399: Ok. Are the students attached to fields that are related to their areas of study or they are attached to any available posts.
19/01/24, 2:57 pm - Harmehak: The programs at majority are related to all the skills required for today's job world, Mrs Nompilo.

While students have various options, they finalize the field they would like to opt for after a discussion their EWYL Mentor.
19/01/24, 2:58 pm - Harmehak: Emmanuel would begin with his EWYL program from Zimbabwe itself,

If all goes well that would be before the end of this month.
19/01/24, 3:01 pm - +263 77 359 7399: Ok. Thats impressive.
19/01/24, 3:01 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate
19/01/24, 3:01 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
19/01/24, 3:03 pm - +263 77 359 7399: Yes I understand
19/01/24, 3:03 pm - Harmehak: That is great, 

So, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be active for the next 20 minutes itself. 

Are you ready?
19/01/24, 3:07 pm - +263 77 237 4241: Yes
19/01/24, 3:09 pm - Harmehak: Mr Sanyanga, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
19/01/24, 3:09 pm - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
19/01/24, 3:15 pm - +263 77 237 4241: 1500-2250$
19/01/24, 3:18 pm - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
19/01/24, 3:18 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
19/01/24, 3:18 pm - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
19/01/24, 3:19 pm - +263 77 237 4241: But with no guarantee of a place?
19/01/24, 3:19 pm - Harmehak: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. <This message was edited>
19/01/24, 3:20 pm - Harmehak: You pay only if Emmanuel is accepted into the program,

There is guaranteed admission.
19/01/24, 3:20 pm - +263 77 237 4241: Ok noted with thanks
19/01/24, 3:21 pm - +263 77 237 4241: And student permit application fees are also included?
19/01/24, 3:22 pm - Harmehak: *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.*
19/01/24, 3:22 pm - +263 77 237 4241: It's clear now thank you
19/01/24, 3:23 pm - Harmehak: That's amazing, so now that you have understood how Edoofa makes the application process affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
19/01/24, 3:23 pm - Harmehak: Now as you can see, because of such an amazing opportunity that Edoofa provides to its students, Edoofa receives thousands of applications on a  daily basis out of which Eligibility Evaluation takes place as I did share with you above, so only if the student is found eligible for the program and get their Acceptance Letter, *they will have to pay the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Acceptance Letter after which they start with their admission process and the Earn While You Learn Program.*
19/01/24, 3:23 pm - Harmehak: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
19/01/24, 3:24 pm - +263 77 237 4241: Noted with thanks
19/01/24, 3:25 pm - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
19/01/24, 3:25 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
19/01/24, 3:25 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in their country itself.
19/01/24, 3:25 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
19/01/24, 3:26 pm - +263 77 237 4241: Yes
19/01/24, 3:26 pm - Harmehak: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
19/01/24, 3:26 pm - Harmehak: Basically, this registration fee ($500-$1000) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024-2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
19/01/24, 3:26 pm - Harmehak: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*

Here is a picture of the Visa of one of the Edoofian who arrived in India, for 2023 Academic Intake.
19/01/24, 3:26 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
19/01/24, 3:33 pm - +263 77 237 4241: So what is the net payment on the students side after everything is in order?
19/01/24, 3:34 pm - Harmehak: The enrollment fee and the costs of education after the scholarship itself please.
19/01/24, 3:34 pm - Harmehak: The registration fee is not a separate fee and is deducted from first's year tuition fee itself so you pay nothing extra. <This message was edited>
19/01/24, 3:35 pm - +263 77 237 4241: Ok
19/01/24, 3:37 pm - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
19/01/24, 3:37 pm - Harmehak: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)
19/01/24, 3:37 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
19/01/24, 3:46 pm - +263 77 237 4241: Noted with thanks
19/01/24, 3:47 pm - Harmehak: Do connect with Mrs Ruth, you will definitely learn more from a parent who has been associated with Edoofa since years, Mr Sanyanga.

Mrs Nompilo and Emmanuel can connect as well
19/01/24, 3:47 pm - +263 77 237 4241: Noted with thanks again
19/01/24, 3:47 pm - Harmehak: You're very welcome please
19/01/24, 3:47 pm - Harmehak: As of now do you have any queries for me?
19/01/24, 3:48 pm - +263 77 237 4241: No
19/01/24, 3:50 pm - Harmehak: Alright please
19/01/24, 3:51 pm - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
19/01/24, 3:51 pm - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
19/01/24, 3:51 pm - Harmehak: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

Your scholarship journey is reaching a crucial juncture. *Tomorrow, on “20-01-23” at 11:30 A.M. CAT,* I will meticulously evaluate your application. This session is not just about answering your questions; it includes a vital Eligibility Check Interview.

We strongly recommend parents/guardians join, recognizing that higher education is a family decision. Prepare for a series of interviews, marking a significant phase in finalizing your scholarship application. As your counselor, I wish you the very best. It's been a pleasure guiding you through your career sessions.

If you qualify for the interview, we would proceed ahead and we look forward to welcoming you to India. Please be proactive, as everyone's time is valuable. The Senior Counselor and Director will make decisions based on your interview and adhere strictly to the given time. Follow instructions diligently, and if the session is completed within the allotted time, your application will proceed.

Happy Family Discussion!
Stay Blessed!
19/01/24, 3:56 pm - +263 77 237 4241: Thank you 🙏
19/01/24, 3:59 pm - Harmehak: You're very welcome please
20/01/24, 11:04 am - Harmehak: Good Morning, Hope you are doing well.

I believe you must have discussed all the above mentioned points with your family?

I am here to address any questions if they have any.

Are we good to proceed with your application now?
20/01/24, 11:49 am - +263 77 237 4241: Yes

20/01/24, 11:53 am - Harmehak: Duly noted
20/01/24, 11:54 am - Harmehak: Have you already had the opportunity to connect with Mrs. Ruth? 

You see, her story is truly remarkable. As a single parent, juggling the responsibilities of a small-scale farmer and the mother of two daughters, she has persevered. Her journey with Edoofa is a testament to how dedicated individuals can overcome obstacles.
Mrs. Ruth's experience with Edoofa is a testament to the transformative impact our programs can have. She not only managed her family's needs but also seized the opportunity for her daughters to achieve higher education. The support and guidance she received from Edoofa were instrumental in her success. The process was challenging, yet incredibly rewarding. Mrs. Ruth's determination, combined with Edoofa's assistance, has paved the way for a brighter future.
20/01/24, 11:54 am - +263 77 359 7399: Currently we do not have any
20/01/24, 11:54 am - Harmehak: Duly noted please!
20/01/24, 11:58 am - +263 77 359 7399: We havent had the opportunity to talk to Miss Ruth. Due to network challenges . Hopefully we will be getting in touch with her today.

*Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage.*
A fact that draws our attention is that, according to his position in life, an extravagant man is either admired or loathed. A successful business man does nothing to increase his popularity by being prudent with his money. A person who is wealthy is expected to lead a luxurious life and to be lavish with his hospitality. If he is not so, he is considered mean, and his reputation in business may even suffer in consequence. The paradox remains that he had not been careful with his money in the first place; he would never have achieved his present wealth.
Among the low income group, a different set of values exists. The young clerk, who makes his wife a present of a new dress when he has not paid his house rent, is condemned as extravagant. Carefulness with money to the point of meanness is applauded as a virtue. Nothing in his life is considered more worthy than paying his bills. The ideal wife for such a man separates her housekeeping money into joyless little piles – so much for rent, for food, for the children’s shoes, she is able to face the milkman with equanimity every, month satisfied with her economizing ways , and never knows the guilt of buying something she can’t really afford .
As for myself, I fall neither of these categories. If I have money to spare I can be extravagant, but when, as is usually the case, I am hard up and then I am the meanest man imaginable.

1. Which of the following would be the most appropriate title for the passage
a)The cause of poverty is extravagance.
b)Stingy habits of the poor.
c)Being extravagant is always condemnable.
d)Extravagance is a part of the rich as well as of the poor.

2.According to the passage the person, who is a successful businessman and wealthy
a)Is more popular if he appears to be wasting away his time.
b)Is expected to have lavish lifestyle.
c)Must be extravagant before achieving success.
d)Should not bother about popularity.

3. The phrase ‘lavish with his hospitality’ in the third sentence of the first paragraph means
a)Extravagance in entertaining guest.
b)Unconcerned in treating his friends and relatives.
c)Thoughtful in spending only on guests and strangers.
d)Stinginess in dealing with his relatives.

4.The word ‘paradox’ in the last sentence of the first paragraph means
a)A word that brings out the hidden meaning
b)Statement based on facts
c)a statement that seems self-contradictory but in reality expresses a possible truth.
d)Statement based on the popular opinion

5.What is the meaning of the word “equanimity”?
a)Calmness
b)Discomposure
c)Equivocal
d)Dubious

Whey to Go Greek yogurt—a strained form of cultured yogurt—has grown enormously in popularity in the United States since it was first introduced in the country in the late 1980s. From 2011 to 2012 alone, sales of Greek yogurt in the US increased by 50 percent. The resulting increase in Greek yogurt production has forced those involved in the business to address the detrimental effects that the yogurt-making process may be having on the environment. Fortunately, farmers and others in the Greek yogurt business have found many methods of controlling and eliminating most environmental threats. Given these solutions as well as the many health benefits of the food, the advantages of Greek yogurt Q5. outdo the potential drawbacks of its production.Sentence [1] The main environmental problem caused by the production of Greek yogurt is the creation of acid whey as a by-product.Sentence [2] Because it requires up to four times more milk to make than conventional yogurt does, Greek yogurt produces larger amounts of acid whey, which is difficult to dispose of.Sentence [3] To address the problem of disposal, farmers have found a number of uses for acid whey. Sentence[4] They can add it to livestock feed as a protein Q.6. supplement, and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt.Sentence[5] If it is improperly introduced into the environment, acid-whey runoff Q.7. can pollute waterways, depleting the oxygen content of streams and rivers as it decomposes. Sentence [6] Yogurt manufacturers, food Q.8. scientists; and government officials are also working together to develop additional solutions for reusing whey.

6.supplement, and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt.
A) NO CHANGE
B) supplement and convert it into gas to use as fuel in electricity production.

20/01/24, 4:04 pm - +263 77 130 7290: In Africa many people face the difficulty of sustaining q healthy and stable diet. This problem has resulted in a number of issues including illnesses due to poor nutrition. Some of the illnesses being brought about due to poor diets include kwashiokor, Goiter, beri beri and many others 

This inconsistency in diet can be the result of the unreliable agricultural industry in many African countries. In other parts of Africa like the Zahara region which is dominated by desert conditions there are very scarce amounts of rainfall throughout the year soo low that agriculture is not productive in the area . So due to this the people mainly eat meat and some insects which contribute to certain nutritional value but neglecting other major nutrients  causing an unbalanced diet . But however in due to latest advances in technology farmers were able to develop new equipment like irrigation that can supplement periods of low rainfall this increase the amount of produce in agriculture.  However not everyone is able to purchase the equipment so we find that the produce is still not enough to feed the number of people and therefor when farmers sell produce the price is usually too high and some people still can not afford to buy produce. 

In other circumstances we find out that people lack knowledge on how to carry out agriculture and they do not practice it leading to imbalanced in our Diets.  

So evaluating the information I have outlined I have come to the conclusion that "YES" it's true Africans have poor diets due to stagnant and inefficient farms . However due to Technological changes the agriculture industry has been on a rise lately.
20/01/24, 4:04 pm - +263 77 130 7290: My name is Stanley Emmanuel Sanyanga . I am a boy born second in a family of 4 children.  I have one elder sister who is in front of me and two younger siblings who are behind .

I grew up in a struggling family with parents who are both working as civil servants. Growing up I had always looking up to my older sister who has always been a role model to me.  I had very little contact to relatives who were outside our family and very little knowledge of them. This made the connection between me and my sister very strong 

So my Sister made it to University which was a promising factor to our family and my struggling parents. She got a course at the University of Zimbabwe. This fuelled me to do the same and be like her . Soo sadly she did not finish her course and had to follow up on the responsibilities of being a parent to her first born  baby. This turn of events changed my whole perception of life as I am the one who is supposed to pick up from where she left off . I really want to go to university and pursue my dream of being able to help my younger siblings go through life financially as my parents are getting older and they won't be here forever so I was really hoping that this opportunity I got through the Edoofa program can help me archive my goals.
