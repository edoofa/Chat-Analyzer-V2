29/01/24, 2:04 pm - +263 71 945 0317: Lately I didn't have internet access so I only know Edoofa Scholarship program helps students to abroad specifically in India and I think it's a good program
29/01/24, 2:12 pm - Harmehak: I understand
29/01/24, 2:13 pm - Harmehak: In that case, let me share more about the program with you.

You see, *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4000 students from different African countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
29/01/24, 2:13 pm - Harmehak: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program. 
We are associated with more than 200 schools in Zimbabwe. Some of the most elite Schools in Zimbabawe example in Harare we are collaborated with St. Dominic’s Chishawasha, Dominican Convent, Christ Ministries and many others. In Manicaland we have a total of 18 Schools to name a few St. David’s Girls Bonda, Hartzell High, First Class, First Choice and so on.  Chipinge we have Chibuwe High School, you would be happy to know that the DEO’s of Mutare and Chipinge have their kids under the Edoofa Scholarship. Masvingo we have 24 Schools collaborated with over 300 students from some of the best schools example Pamushana, St. Antony’s, Reformed Church Gutu, Zaka High and many others. The program is also appreciated by the Education Inspector of Bikita Madam Makomeke.We have more than 500 students from Mashonaland (West, Central and East) Province, Midlands Province.  Last but not the Least we also have Schools from Bulawayo and Matebaland South associated with Edoofa. 

Our collaborations with the UCE College Bulawayo adds a feather to the Cap of trust that Edoofa has built in a span of 14 years. 

The Schools, Institutions and Educationists who have made efforts to train the students for this prestigious Scholarship Program are also the Authorized Designatories of EDOOFA in Zimbabawe. 
We have Mr. Shorwi Kawadza (Retd. Headmaster Hartzell), Mr. Charles Jerera (Retd. Ministry of Education), Ms. Christina Rockson (Founder and Principal of Hilltop Christian College in SA) who have shown relentless efforts to guide students on the right path to success.EDOOFA boasts a proud students and parents community of more than 2000 from Zimbabwe who are happy with the quality of education and the employability outcomes.
29/01/24, 2:14 pm - +263 71 945 0317: Thank you
29/01/24, 2:18 pm - +263 71 945 0317: So how does one get accepted?
29/01/24, 2:31 pm - Harmehak: We will discuss the entire process today itself!
29/01/24, 2:31 pm - Harmehak: I feel you too are looking for something like this, so that just like these students you can cater for your higher education by your own self and help your parents reduce their financial burden, isn't it?
29/01/24, 5:16 pm - +263 71 945 0317: Yes that's it
29/01/24, 9:07 pm - Harmehak: I was hoping we could connect earlier, however I would be scheduling your session for *tomorrow at 9:30 AM CAT*, as my working hours for the day are over and it's already been a long day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
29/01/24, 9:08 pm - +263 71 945 0317: Okay noted
29/01/24, 9:16 pm - +263 71 945 0317: Does the scholarship cover transport fees from Zimbabwe to India and visas etc
30/01/24, 9:43 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
30/01/24, 9:48 am - +263 71 945 0317: Yes
30/01/24, 9:49 am - +263 71 945 0317: I'm doing well and you
30/01/24, 9:52 am - Harmehak: If you understand the concept of international education finances that play a major role are not visa fees and flight tickets. The flight ticket is required a very limited number of times as the students don't travel that often. I don't mean to say that students can not go back to their country, they can definitely go back to enjoy the holidays. What I have personally seen is, the students do not travel that often.
So, considering the main finance which plays the most important role in international education is the annual fees. So, to reduce this annual fee, Edoofa helps a student with the Earn While You Learn Program. This program provides the students with an opportunity to earn scholarship credits which in return help them to make their education more affordable.
Visa fees and flight tickets are to be bought just a month before they plan to come to India. So, let's say the student wants to come to India in August 2024, This means that his family has to cater the Visa fee and the ticket in July 2024. If you understand the concept properly, till July 2024, the student will be working in the Earn While You Learn program and will be earning Scholarship credits. Now, with this opportunity, you can save a lot of money on the annual fee which in return helps you to make your flight ticket and the Visa fee affordable.
As mentioned to you already, the scholarship covers the tuition fees as you see, the Edoofa scholarship is basically the scholarship seats acquired from the universities for their good work in the past 14 years in the higher education space. So the travel costs will have to be covered by the student, But our admission team assist you in all the steps. So that you get the cheapest air travel tickets and also easily acquire the visa.
The cost for both the visa and flight cost will be around $350-$490, But you need not worry about that yet as you will be coming to India in the month of July-August this year as per your preparations
30/01/24, 3:02 pm - +263 71 945 0317: Okay I understand
30/01/24, 3:09 pm - Harmehak: May I know the reason behind such delayed participation, Talent?
30/01/24, 3:41 pm - +263 71 945 0317: I'm really sorry,network here is really down
30/01/24, 3:42 pm - +263 71 945 0317: Can you tell me everything I need to know as a student?
30/01/24, 3:42 pm - +263 71 945 0317: How about accommodation?
30/01/24, 3:55 pm - Harmehak: Let me explain to you that there are two kinds of programs that provide assistance to the students because a lot of times parents and students themselves misunderstand what a Scholarship actually means.

*1. Scholarships*
*2. Sponsorships*

Scholarships make education *affordable* for the students by reducing their *Tuition Fees*, now a lot of times parents and students consider that a Domestic Scholarship would be the same as an International Scholarship, but to understand the difference between them, consider yourself applying for an education in your own country with the help of a scholarship. Now after the scholarship when your tuition fee would be reduced, eventually your entire cost of education would be reduced because being a citizen of the country, you wouldn't be required to spend any fees on Accommodation and feeding separately since in that case, students would be staying with their families. However, if I personally plan to study in Zimbabwe with the same scholarship, I would have to incur some costs on Accommodation and Feeding because I am not a Zimbabwean Citizen. So a lot of times parents and students consider International Scholarship and Domestic Scholarship one and the same thing, but in reality, they aren't.

Sponsorships, on the other hand, take care entirely of a student's education, but because Sponsorships are provided by only a few organizations, there are a lot of terms and conditions which a student might need to follow in order to get the sponsorship, the most common term is that a student after completion of the course would have to work for the organization providing the sponsorship for a period of time.
30/01/24, 3:57 pm - +263 71 945 0317: Okay I understand
30/01/24, 4:24 pm - Harmehak: *Alright so Talent, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.*

I would like to know you better as a student so please go ahead, tell me a bit about yourself, your education, how much USD Merit study centre charges you every term, along with what do you wish to study, your strengths and weaknesses, and your hobbies, since I honestly don't know a lot about you?

And with that a detailed description of your family background, what do your parents do *(Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work)?*, what is their highest education level along with if you have any siblings, please?
30/01/24, 5:01 pm - +263 71 945 0317: Okay My name is Talent Tapiwa Morgen,born and raised in a rural area called Mhondoro Ngezi but later in I moved to harare to live with my grandmother my parents don't have job,they just hustle at Merit study center I did my A level and it was $235 per term.i would like to study Actuarial science mainly because my strengths are in mathematics,my hobbies are watching movies, reading books and playing soccer

30/01/24, 5:43 pm - Harmehak: Duly noted please!
30/01/24, 5:43 pm - Harmehak: Well Talent, now as we proceed ahead, I would like to your thoughts on higher education abroad!

30/01/24, 5:57 pm - +263 71 945 0317: Yes I do
30/01/24, 6:13 pm - Harmehak: Very well and would you add that you are mentally prepared for a life abroad too? <This message was edited>

30/01/24, 6:43 pm - Harmehak: You would require financial support for about $1200-1400 a year!
30/01/24, 6:47 pm - +263 71 945 0317: Okay
30/01/24, 6:48 pm - Harmehak: Didn't you happen to go through the document that was shared at the earlier stage before applying please?
30/01/24, 6:48 pm - +263 71 945 0317: I did I wanted to confirm
30/01/24, 6:49 pm - Harmehak: I hope now you have a better clarity?
30/01/24, 6:49 pm - +263 71 945 0317: Yes
30/01/24, 6:59 pm - Harmehak: Kindly address the same now!
30/01/24, 7:02 pm - +263 71 945 0317: Okay noted
30/01/24, 7:04 pm - Harmehak: I am expecting your response!

Are they willing to support you financially?
30/01/24, 7:05 pm - +263 71 945 0317: Not really the money is too much
30/01/24, 7:06 pm - +263 71 945 0317: So I will look for a job to raise some funds then maybe I can come next year
30/01/24, 7:09 pm - Harmehak: I understand!
30/01/24, 7:09 pm - +263 71 945 0317: Ok
30/01/24, 7:09 pm - Harmehak: I believe your mother have been supporting you financially for your school fee, isn't it Talent?
30/01/24, 7:10 pm - +263 71 945 0317: Yes
30/01/24, 7:11 pm - Harmehak: I believe your tuition fee for school itself costs about $700-800 for a year, isn't it Talent?
30/01/24, 7:11 pm - +263 71 945 0317: Yes that's it
30/01/24, 7:12 pm - Harmehak: Similarly there must be costs like Food, Transport, Internet, Stationary and other basic school expenses, isn't it?
30/01/24, 7:13 pm - +263 71 945 0317: Yes you're right
30/01/24, 7:14 pm - Harmehak: I believe it must be close to about $1000-1100 that your mother has been spending on your secondary education, Talent?
30/01/24, 7:19 pm - +263 71 945 0317: Yes probably
30/01/24, 7:20 pm - Harmehak: In that case, may I know what are your expectation for the expenses of tertiary education, Talent?

Given these costs are included of Tuition fee, Food and Accommodation!
30/01/24, 7:20 pm - Harmehak: Talent, Senior Academician Mr Piyush were in Zimbabwe for about 90 days, from his experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,

While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time. 

This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year. 

Wouldn't you agree to the same?
30/01/24, 7:21 pm - +263 71 945 0317: Yes you're right
30/01/24, 7:22 pm - +263 71 945 0317: So we will try to Make arrangements
