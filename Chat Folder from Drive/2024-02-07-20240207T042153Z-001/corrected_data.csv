So now I'm very confused, I'm  just waiting for you whether the journey we'll be successful or not. But please let me know if there's no hope.  Have a good  day

The document you sent me yesterday gave me a bigger picture on what the EWYL program is all obout.It is going to have a great impact in our future  because of the skills that it is bringing to us.The projects that it has are fascinating.The first  project made me hungry for work.I would really love to get in touch with big organizations.This is a very great opportunity in life because a student will be able to get professional connections which will be there forever.Im glad that the hard work comes with very very good rewards which are the scholarship credits which will assist in lowering the study costs.I was happy that the second project gives a student an opportunity to spread the news about the Edoofa program to friends and relatives so that many people's futures are brightened.What amazed me is that it's not only the friends and relatives who should know but even the schools in the student's region should know so that everyone gets the chance to hear about the Edoofa program.The EWYL program needs hard work and commitment which is a good experience in moulding a student's future.

After all, only 6 months are left! So, get ready for this epic adventure, and I'll share the details with you super soon! ‚ö°  *By the way, we'd like to reserve your seats in advance.

The first factor is the nature of the company, we should choose the companies which are suitable for student-centric for example virtual gaming platform, podcasts/music apps , social interaction platforms. We should also consider the scale of the company. These is to look how big the company is . We are required to choose medium companies not too big or small. Financial stability is another factor we should look during the companies selection. We also have to search about the background of the company. The platform which can be used are google, LinkedIn, crunch Base,ich4media or social media platform like Facebook Instagram and twitter.

It also mention basic skills which do not expire,  for example Relationship building, Risk-taking, Decision making and Empathy. The first project mentioned on the document which is Corporate Alliances,  talks about investigating on companies or organizations and connecting them with Edoofa. The second project is about connecting with people to give them an insight and an opportunity to be part of a bigger family, Edoofa.  As we all agree every one should be given an opportunity to better education. The third project is connecting with schools and introducing Edoofa to them,  and connecting them to the Edoofa.

A right is sanctioned by the government to protect the interests of the people and also against ill-treatment and inequality. Examples of such right are the right to life, privacy, voting, etc. some rights, however, are not protected by law or even sanctioned by the government, rights like self-determination (collective rights). Rights like Civil and Political rights are quite the opposite and can be defended in the courts of law. Whereas duties are given to individuals that have proven responsible enough to take the task assigned to them, usually by in higher offices or elderly people. They are usually overseen by the people that assigns the duty they are also regarded as obligations one has to fulfil. In a case of an organisation it‚Äôs the duty of the company clerk to organise meetings, this role is usually over seen and tasked by their higher offices. 3. An attorney by definition is a person(lawyer) appointed to act on behalf of someone or company concerning legal matters. The attorney has to be admitted to the bar before he is able to represent someone in the courts of law concerning any legal matters. He/she is able to advise people on any legal matter and defend them in any aspect of, law be it corporate, civil and criminal cases. They work individually to gather evidence and necessary documents for their defence. Whereas a prosecutor by definition is a person, public official who institutes legal proceedings against someone. He is in charge of all criminal proceedings and represents the government, he also brings defendants in criminal cases to justice in the name of the state/ the crown. A Prosecutor can only defend the government and only in criminal cases. The prosecutor works in conjunction with the police and other governmental entities that work to his favour. 4.Corporate law. I want to be involved actively in the building and upholding of companies and organisations, in turn I will know the building blocks of the company and l, one day, will be able to start my own company with the knowledge I will acquire. I would like to see organisations grow and reach greater heights with the contributions I make to the decisions, help like give advice on partnerships and making deals that benefit both parties. I want to be able to help and control interaction within the company and between the company and the people. By putting up policies and agreements to protect the interests of the company and the people. I want to one day make deals with big companies and protect the interest of the people and the company as I make those deals. Also I want to ensure compliancy, organisation and navigate the laws that govern the does and don‚Äôts of the company. 5.My organisation skills are quite a skill because I can be able to organise my work and work around me making work a lot easier to navigate. I have okay social skills that can help me work with anyone, these social skills I believe can help make good negotiations and deals, convincing people with factual information. Example, I am able to talk to any type of people and understand their point of view.¬† I believe my creativity caters as a skill that can help me make new and innovative agreements that benefit all parties. I am able to analyse and understand situations effectively giving the ability to make decision not based on emotion. With due time I believe my skills will develop in accordance to my course and more skills will be learnt and developed.

284 - 06 Feb 2024 01:19PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your response regarding the SOP form and academic questions.  With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey.
285 - 06 Feb 2024 01:20PM - Ashi Edoofa: Before we proceed to the next stage, I'd like to assist you in getting started with your EWYL Journey. Based on your EWYL application form, you are scheduled to commence your EWYL journey on Friday (16-Feb-2024).
286 - 06 Feb 2024 01:20PM - Ashi Edoofa: With your intention and commencement date in mind, we have already communicated this information to the EWYL team. They are prepared to initiate your EWYL program on Friday, as previously agreed upon.  To kickstart the process, your dedicated EWYL Mentor has established your EWYL Group and shared the invitation link with us. Here's what you and your parents/guardian/sponsor need to do:  https://chat.whatsapp.com/HI4zJsSt5n39abLfr0RTpf
287 - 06 Feb 2024 01:21PM - Ashi Edoofa: Use the provided link to join your group. Once both you and your parents have joined, please send the following message to the group:  *Dear Mentor, my name is Ntali Chapeshamano, and my EWYL group name is Ntali EWYL23E1162. I am excited to begin my EWYL Journey. As discussed with the admission team, I am committed to being available on  Friday (16-Feb-2024) to commence the procedures. Kindly schedule my session for the same date so that I can maximize the benefits and start on the right track.*
288 - 06 Feb 2024 01:21PM - Ashi Edoofa: Once you start with the EWYL Program and are able to connect with your mentor, please update the same here as well by sending the below message -  *Hello Admission officer, I am now in touch with my EWYL Mentor. The name of my Mentor is _________ and he/she has scheduled my session for ________*(mention the date)
310 - 06 Feb 2024 02:59PM - +260 95 5956785: Thank so much for the response which is now loud and clear.
311 - 06 Feb 2024 03:03PM - Ashi Edoofa: Most welcome @260955956785
312 - 06 Feb 2024 03:03PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship: 1. *Tuition Fee*: $650 per annum 2. *Accommodation Fee*: $0 per annum (100% Sponsorship) 3. *Remaining Fee Components*: [Library Fee, Examination Fee, EDB and Book Bank, International Student Development Fund, 24-Hour WiFi Cost, Maintenance Fee, Water Bill, and Electricity Bill]: $1000 per annum  *Total Fee: Tuition Fee $650 + Accommodation Fee $0 + Remaining Fee Components $1000 = $1650 per annum.*
313 - 06 Feb 2024 03:03PM - Ashi Edoofa: Registration Fee to be paid: $1000 (deadline within two weeks of issue of the offer letter, part of the university‚Äôs first-year fee and will be adjusted against the first-year cost of education $1650). I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?
314 - 06 Feb 2024 04:56PM - +260 95 5956785: Yes I have...
315 - 06 Feb 2024 06:18PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $1000, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $1000 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year‚Äôs fee, which is $1650 as per the above example.
316 - 06 Feb 2024 06:18PM - Ashi Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $1650 - $1000 = $650 . This amount can be paid in two installments of $325 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India.  Subsequently, the remaining balance of $325 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
317 - 06 Feb 2024 08:28PM - +260 95 5956785: How long do the universities take to respond to the applications once you submit?
318 - 06 Feb 2024 08:31PM - Ashi Edoofa: Usually it takes 4 - 5 days dear
319 - 06 Feb 2024 08:31PM - Ashi Edoofa: As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.",No,Yes

191 - 06 Feb 2024 04:44PM - +27 61 220 8989: 2.In general, entrepreneurship and economic development are closely related. Entrepreneurship is essential for economic growth and development, as it creates new businesses, jobs, and wealth. When entrepreneurs start new businesses, they create new products and services that can stimulate demand and increase the overall level of economic activity. This can lead to an increase in the standard of living and a reduction in poverty. Additionally, entrepreneurship can spur innovation and create new technologies that can drive economic growth. In short, without entrepreneurship, economic development would be limited. 3.Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) are a set of rules and standards that govern financial reporting in the United States. They were created to ensure consistency, transparency, and comparability in financial reporting, so that investors, creditors, and other stakeholders can make informed decisions based on reliable financial information. GAAP includes rules on how to record, measure, and report on financial transactions. It also includes standards on how to present financial statements, such as the balance sheet, income statement, and cash flow statement. GAAP is important because it helps to ensure that financial information is accurate and comparable across companies, which is crucial for investors . 4.Accounting standards are the rules and principles that govern how accounting information is recorded, measured, and reported. They ensure that financial information is presented in a consistent, reliable, and comparable manner. Accounting standards are established by independent bodies such as the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) in the United States and the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) globally. These standards are mandatory because they provide a common framework for businesses to prepare their financial statements. This allows investors and other users of financial information to compare the performance of different companies. Without standardized accounting standards, it would be difficult to make accurate comparisons between companies. 5.Accounting and auditing are two distinct, yet related, functions in the financial world. Accounting refers to the process of recording, classifying, and summarizing financial transactions to produce financial statements. Auditing is the process of examining and verifying the accuracy of those financial statements. In other words, accounting provides the raw data, while auditing ensures that the data is accurate and reliable. Both are essential functions in maintaining the integrity of financial information and ensuring that it is used responsibly. The main difference is that accounting is focused on recording and reporting information, while auditing is focused on assessing and validating that information.

237 - 06 Feb 2024 01:57PM - Dev Edoofa: With this consent, you have enabled us to make progress to the third step in Alois' admission journey, i.e. *Introduction to Financial Secure Plan*.
238 - 06 Feb 2024 01:59PM - Dev Edoofa: Let us move forward with our discussion. To confirm our records: the course that Alois selected for your higher education is BCom (Accounting and International Finance) and it's my understanding that he is planning to arrive in India in August 2025. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
239 - 06 Feb 2024 03:35PM - +263 77 306 5310: Yes is planning to arrive in India in August 2025 sir you are correct sir
240 - 06 Feb 2024 04:00PM - Dev Edoofa: Thanks for your confirmation! Based on our experience of over 14 years and having assisted over 5000 students from different countries, we have realized that financial planning is the most important factor when a student plans for their higher education abroad.
241 - 06 Feb 2024 04:00PM - Dev Edoofa: I am sure that you must be aware that 20-30% of students who are admitted into universities abroad are unable to fulfill their dream and come to India due to a lack of financial planning. The funds needed for booking flights, accommodation, and covering living expenses after arrival often become overwhelming, leading to the decision to defer their admission for a year. This, in turn, creates a gap in the child's education.
242 - 06 Feb 2024 04:00PM - Dev Edoofa: To assist both students and parents in this regard, Edoofa Management has designed a Financial Secure Plan that aims to help you prepare for your higher educational finances without experiencing stress or last-minute rushes. I believe you must be wondering about the details of the same plan and how it helps the parents?

Techniques used for placing samples under a microscope includes Dry mount where a specimen is placed on a slide with or without a cover slipover it.This method is useful for viewing dry specimens such as hair and pollen. The other one is wet mount where a specimen is placed on a drop of water especially distilled water on the slide with a cover slip placed over it. This is often used for viewing cells. Other techniques include the following, place your sample on the stage and turn on the LED light. Look through the eyepieces and move the focus knob until the image comes into focus. Adjust the distance between the eyepieces until you can see the sample clearly with both eyes simultaneously. Inorder to accurately look at specimens under a microscope,you must first need to learn how to properly prepare a wet mount.A wet mount is made by placing a fluid solution on a slide, suspending a specimen in a solution, and the covering the specimen and the solution with a cover slide   195 words

324 - 06 Feb 2024 02:21PM - Kirti Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
325 - 06 Feb 2024 02:21PM - Kirti Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $1000. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
326 - 06 Feb 2024 02:21PM - Kirti Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee.  This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
327 - 06 Feb 2024 08:47PM - +263 78 006 5624: Yes we discussed about it
328 - 06 Feb 2024 09:19PM - Kirti Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.  I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $1200 to $1800 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?",No,No

I must commend your family, must take great pride in your achievements and be dedicated to ensuring your access to the finest opportunities to launch your career.  Speaking of valuable opportunities, I am also curious to learn more about your counseling session with your counselor and to understand which aspects of the Edoofa Scholarship Program have particularly impressed you thus far. Can you share this with me?
36 - 06 Feb 2024 03:26PM - +263 78 483 1208: Our counseling session was very informative, supportive and very inspirational. Our counselor was so dedicated evidenced by the contributions he made. I liked the Edoofians' testimonials especially for Valerie's testimonial- ""Rising to the top- An Edoofians Journey of Accomplishment"". She took us from the start of the Edoofian Journey, the internship options and how they help the student's financial plan to contribute towards fees and pursue further studies - the benefits of the EWYL. It was quite impressive. Every morning our counsellor generously lighted our spirits through motivational quotes. It grabbed our attention and made our day enjoyable and willing to be part of the Edoofa's journey. Edoofa's affordability towards higher education and the guarantee of employment after quality studies are mainly the key aspects of the Edoofa Scholarship Program that have particularly impressed me thus far. Through accessing quality education my profile will be highly markatable and be able to archieve my dreams.

51 - 06 Feb 2024 02:28PM - +260 96 2476932: Yes we can connect
52 - 06 Feb 2024 02:34PM - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
53 - 06 Feb 2024 02:39PM - +260 96 2476932: I do not recall talking about the registration process. Did you discuss it with me or my parents?
54 - 06 Feb 2024 02:41PM - +260 96 2476932: This I should believe is what we discussed, right?
60 - 06 Feb 2024 03:05PM - Kirti Edoofa: You must make a crucial decision among the various offer letters you receive, considering factors like university exposure, ranking, and affordability. After choosing a university, you need to reserve your scholarship seat by paying a registration fee, typically $500 to $750, within two to four weeks of receiving the offer letter. This fee is considered part of the first-year tuition for Edoofa Program students and should be paid in your home country to secure the seat. Are we clear here?
61 - 06 Feb 2024 03:10PM - +260 96 2476932: Yes we are clear. Go on.
62 - 06 Feb 2024 03:18PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. You are qualified for a scholarship through Edoofa, reducing your annual education cost in India to $2000 to $3000, covering tuition, food, accommodation, and other expenses. Let's use an example to explain the registration process. If your chosen university has the following fees:
63 - 06 Feb 2024 03:18PM - Kirti Edoofa: Tuition Fee: $1800 per year Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per year Registration Fee: $750 (due within two weeks)  The total fee would be a Tuition Fee of $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee of $1000 = $2800 per year. To reserve your scholarship seat, you pay the $750 registration fee, which is adjusted to your first-year fee, making it $2800 - $750 = $2050. You can pay this in two installments of $1025 each, with the first due within the first three days of your arrival in India. The remaining balance can be paid in monthly installments for financial flexibility and on-time payments. Please let me know if you are clear here.
64 - 06 Feb 2024 03:44PM - +260 96 2476932: Yes we are clear
65 - 06 Feb 2024 04:19PM - Kirti Edoofa: Upon successfully paying the registration fee, your ""Earn While You Learn"" (EWYL) credits account will be linked to the university's fee account. This allows you to use your EWYL credits to offset your annual university fees, providing you with financial flexibility throughout your education. Additionally, after the registration fee payment, you will receive the Admission Acceptance Letter, which is crucial for securing admission and obtaining your student visa. If you have any questions about the admission process or the associated costs for your higher education, please feel free to ask.
66 - 06 Feb 2024 04:21PM - +260 96 2476932: Let me take time to absorb the information and then if I have any questions I'll get back to you. Thank you.
67 - 06 Feb 2024 04:24PM - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, Now with this, we are done with step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
68 - 06 Feb 2024 04:24PM - Kirti Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one.
69 - 06 Feb 2024 04:24PM - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
73 - 06 Feb 2024 04:37PM - Kirti Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.  As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received special news for the students of the 2024 admission intake. May I know if you are excited to know the news we have for you?
74 - 06 Feb 2024 04:50PM - +260 96 2476932: I'm very eager to know the news
75 - 06 Feb 2024 04:50PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am happy to see that you are excited. After speaking with thousands of students and parents who completed their admission process before you, we realized that the current economic situation in African countries makes it a bit challenging for parents to pay the full registration fee at once.  In response to the same challenge, we had a detailed discussion with the academic board and university official. As a result, we developed a solution to alleviate the financial burden of the parents specifically for the registration fee due of $500 to $$750.
76 - 06 Feb 2024 04:50PM - Kirti Edoofa: We at Edoofa are thrilled about this development, and I believe it will significantly help all of our students and their families. Are you aware of the solution?
77 - 06 Feb 2024 05:06PM - +260 96 2476932: I've only heard of the solution now
78 - 06 Feb 2024 06:39PM - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright, let me share the same. With respect to the conversation we had with the academic board and the university officials, we requested them to allow the students to make the payment of their registration fee in two parts within a span of 45 days thereby reducing the financial pressure.
79 - 06 Feb 2024 06:39PM - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: Consider that your registration fee is $750. After you will receive the offer letter, the first part of the registration fees which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, i.e. $375 needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university (For most of the universities 15 days). Subsequently, the second part of $375, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date. <This message was edited>
80 - 06 Feb 2024 06:40PM - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for February 15, 2024, and your registration fee stands at $750, you'll need to make a payment of $375 on or before February 15, 2024. The remaining $375 should be paid by March 15, 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
81 - 06 Feb 2024 09:23PM - +260 96 2476932: I've followed the details so far. Thank you.
82 - 06 Feb 2024 09:24PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. As your guardian, I am sure your parents are excited to initiate the process? For the current round of admissions, only 31 scholarship seats are available and hence let us begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the payment plan offered for the registration fee. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?",No,Yes

I encourage you to openly discuss any factors or influences that led to this shift in plans. Are you considering a change in the course, or is it financial concerns that are influencing these decisions?
56 - 06 Feb 2024 11:04AM - +263 78 707 7037: Course hasnt changed i already got a place in the local university NUST u should check it out

59 - 06 Feb 2024 11:55AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Choosing to make short-term sacrifices for education now could pave the way for a more prosperous future. On the other hand, remaining in your comfort zone might lead to a lifetime of working far from home, possibly in jobs with limited opportunities, such as in mines, selling SIM cards on the road, or taking up minimum-wage positions. Missing out on quality education today may result in a prolonged struggle for meaningful employment, even after graduating from a top university in Zimbabwe. Consider the potential consequences and decide on the path that aligns with your long-term goals and aspirations.  I understand its difficult but don't worry we have a huge community of student fro your country and it would like a second home and we will be there like your second family.

71 - 06 Feb 2024 12:29PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Being a senior academic and counsellor, my aspirations for young learners like you are similar. I firmly believe higher education should combine the following for a learner to achieve their goals:-  Quality Education Conducive Environment Critical Thinking and Practical learning skills Technological Literacy and Attachments Cultural Awareness and Global Perspective Career guidance, Mentorships, etc.   *However, not everyone achieves success. Do you know why*?
72 - 06 Feb 2024 12:30PM - +263 77 528 4875: Great!!   I do not know please help me Sir

75 - 06 Feb 2024 12:34PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: *Personalized mentorship and guidance throughout your course:* As your Career Counsellor, I have known you since the beginning of the process, understanding your interests, aspirations, family background and plans for your career, unlike a University officer who may come across your application for the first time and treats with the same importance like others. I personally understand where you come from and what is required for you to be successful.
86 - 06 Feb 2024 12:47PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: As I have promised, the Edoofa Admissions team will be submitting your application to multiple universities that will evaluate your application and upon being eligible, you receive the offer letters with comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. *I will guide you to the best education institution/university associated with us that aligns with your vision and interest and would provide you with a conducive environment for your holistic development and to fulfil your career goals.*  Upon receiving the Offer Letter, you will have a few weeks to pay a portion of your university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. We discussed the registration fee during our counselling sessions. May I know, what do you recall about the same now?
87 - 06 Feb 2024 12:55PM - +263 77 528 4875: Awesome! What I remember is Edoofa's Tuition and living fees is $2000-3000 including food and living expenses.Also through EWYL program I can be able to reduce the costs as this will make my education affordable through employability.
88 - 06 Feb 2024 01:00PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: As we discussed in the counselling session, the cost of education in India ranges from $6000-$8000 per annum which is reduced to $2000-$3000 per annum through the Edoofa Scholarship Program which includes the registration fee, remaining tuition fees, Accommodation, Food, Wifi, Laundry, library fee etc. Now, let us assume,  1. *Tuition Fee*: $1800 per annum 2. *Food and Accommodation Fee*: $1000 per annum Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum 3. *Registration Fee to be paid:* $1000  This means this registration fee that you pay will be subtracted from the cost of education ($2800-$1000= $1800) and the remaining fee of $1800 can be paid in two installments. The first part of $900 within 3 days after your arrival here in India and the remaining $900 will be due in December 2024, or before your second semester begins.  *Do you have any questions for me regarding the same?*
89 - 06 Feb 2024 01:02PM - +263 77 528 4875: With me I do not have any questions.I am not sure or my parents do have questions
90 - 06 Feb 2024 01:20PM - +263 77 957 0923: Good day sir we are on the same page sir may be with time if we have some questions we will ask.
91 - 06 Feb 2024 01:55PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: The registration fee can be paid either in two equal parts(The first half within 15 days and the second half within 30 days) or in one go itself.  Are you clear with the details?
92 - 06 Feb 2024 02:57PM - +263 77 528 4875: Yes yes I understand
93 - 06 Feb 2024 03:43PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: With this, we can proceed to step 4 of the admission cycle, i.e., Offer Letter from University/College. The universities will take three to five days to evaluate your application, after which, if they accept your application for a scholarship, they will send you a scholarship offer letter. In the offer letter, the scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee will be mentioned.  On this note, let us conclude our conversation for today. I will reach out to you once we get an update from the universities. Wish you a blessed day ahead, and please extend our regards to your family as well.
94 - 06 Feb 2024 03:44PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: I want you to share the following documents with us as they are required for your university application preparation:  *1. A-Level Result/Letter of Recommendation/Statement of Entry (A-Level).*  *2. O-Level Results*  *3. Identity proof (International Traveling Passport or National ID or Birth Certificate)*

By making efforts from your end, I can then effectively advocate for your application to be considered for a higher percentage of scholarship.

Seize the opportunity to break free from limitations. Keep in mind Philippians 4:13 (NIV), ""I can do all this through him who gives me strength."" Let education empower your child!*  Over the past few days, we've been trying to connect with you to discuss your child's academic journey. We understand the financial commitments involved in providing quality education for your child. The challenges in Africa, particularly the uncertainty of employment after completing a bachelor's degree, are evident.  Considering the urgency of your child's education, I've scheduled a session for *tomorrow at 09:30 AM CAT* .Looking forward to connecting with you tomorrow.

67 - 05 Feb 2024 03:56PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: *Embrace education as the key to a brighter future. Proverbs 4:7 (NIV) wisely states, ""The beginning of wisdom is this: Get wisdom."" Seize the opportunity to break free from limitations. Keep in mind Philippians 4:13 (NIV), ""I can do all this through him who gives me strength."" Let education empower your child!*  Over the past few days, we've been trying to connect with you to discuss your child's academic journey. We understand the financial commitments involved in providing quality education for your child. The challenges in Africa, particularly the uncertainty of employment after completing a bachelor's degree, are evident.  Considering the urgency of your child's education, I've scheduled a session for *tomorrow at 09:30 AM CAT* .Looking forward to connecting with you tomorrow.

191 - 06 Feb 2024 03:22PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. My day has been going good, thank you for asking. In our previous session, we had discussed how the Financial Secure Plan works for the first 15 months. Now, from the 16th Month till the 20th month, considering it is a 6-month window, you can again continue depositing the money ($150) with Edoofa which can be used in the fee as and when required or you can decide to save this $900 of these 6 months with you as well. This is something which you are free to choose. I hope you have understood the financial secure plan now?

Help them understand its importance and details. Once you're done, we can reconnect, have a discussion, and address any queries you may have. After resolving your concerns, I'll guide you through starting your financial security plan.  While most students can discuss this with their family the same day, I understand everyone is different. Could you let me know when you think you'll have the discussion with your family? This way, we can schedule our next session accordingly.

The reason for this is that when you apply for your student Visa, the Embassy asks for a Bank Statement, and this account will serve that purpose.

The most common types of pesticides are insecticides, fungicides, herbicides, and rodenticides. Insecticides are used to control insects, while fungicides are used to control fungi. Herbicides are used to control weeds, and rodenticides are used to control rodents. Some pesticides can be applied directly to the target organism, while others are applied to the environment around the target organism.

This tight timeframe has made it challenging for 20-30% of students to proceed with their higher education in India.  To address this issue, Edoofa has introduced the Financial Secure Plan. By depositing $150 each month, you can start saving for your first year of education now. This plan aims to ease any future financial pressures during the registration period.

Kindly excuse me for not being able to respond to your last message as our operational hours had concluded. I am pleased to hear that we are on the same page regarding the discussion. Before we proceed with our session today, I would like to ask how your day has been going so far?
159 - 06 Feb 2024 10:23AM - +263 78 688 6221: Good morning to you too ,my day is going well so far thank you.
160 - 06 Feb 2024 10:44AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Allow me to proceed with our discussion -  If you see the bigger picture, you will realize that the reason is quite simple. Upon the completion of the 10 installments, the Edoofa Admissions team will initiate the Child‚Äôs Admission Process by applying early to the universities to secure their scholarship and their university seat.
161 - 06 Feb 2024 10:44AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Reserving seats earlier increases the chances of obtaining a maximum scholarship. A higher scholarship means lower fees, and by securing the seat, you will be entitled to pay the fees as per the old fee structure of the university, not the new one implemented in January 2025. Furthermore, when applying to the universities, you will receive an offer letter or a letter of intent detailing the fees, scholarship, and registration fees.
162 - 06 Feb 2024 10:44AM - Sidhi Edoofa: As explained during the enrollment process, the registration fee is a portion of your first-year university fee, paid to reserve the seat. It ranges from $500-$1000 and is not an additional fee.  From the $1500 you saved with Edoofa, the registration fee will be paid to the university, securing the seat. For instance, if the registration fee is $1000, Edoofa will pay $1000 from the $1500 saved in 10 months. The updated balance with Edoofa will be $500, which will be paid to the university upon your arrival in India.
163 - 06 Feb 2024 10:44AM - Sidhi Edoofa: This eases the financial burden on the parent, as there is no immediate payment required upon the student's arrival. The $500 saved will cover the remaining fees for the semester/year, as specified in the offer letter from the university. What are your thoughts on this?
164 - 06 Feb 2024 02:44PM - +263 78 688 6221: That's wonderful

A higher scholarship means lower fees, and by securing the seat, you will be entitled to pay the fees as per the old fee structure of the university, not the new one implemented in January 2025. Furthermore, when applying to the universities, you will receive an offer letter or a letter of intent detailing the fees, scholarship, and registration fees.
162 - 06 Feb 2024 10:44AM - Sidhi Edoofa: As explained during the enrollment process, the registration fee is a portion of your first-year university fee, paid to reserve the seat. It ranges from $500-$1000 and is not an additional fee.  From the $1500 you saved with Edoofa, the registration fee will be paid to the university, securing the seat. For instance, if the registration fee is $1000, Edoofa will pay $1000 from the $1500 saved in 10 months. The updated balance with Edoofa will be $500, which will be paid to the university upon your arrival in India.
163 - 06 Feb 2024 10:44AM - Sidhi Edoofa: This eases the financial burden on the parent, as there is no immediate payment required upon the student's arrival. The $500 saved will cover the remaining fees for the semester/year, as specified in the offer letter from the university. What are your thoughts on this?
164 - 06 Feb 2024 02:44PM - +263 78 688 6221: That's wonderful
165 - 06 Feb 2024 03:05PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to see that we are together so far. With this plan for the next 10 months, I am sure you must be wondering what will happen in the next 10 months, considering you have already secured your scholarship seat with the university due to your hard work in the first 10 months. Is my understanding correct?
166 - 06 Feb 2024 03:25PM - +263 78 688 6221: Yes
167 - 06 Feb 2024 04:01PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Let me help you with that as well. In the 11th month, you will be guided to open an FBC Mastercard bank account in Zimbabwe with a deposit of $150. The reason for this is that when you apply for your student Visa, the Embassy asks for a Bank Statement, and this account will serve that purpose.
168 - 06 Feb 2024 04:01PM - Sidhi Edoofa: We understand it might be expensive if you deposit another $1500 for the remaining 10 months in FB  Bank Zimbabwe, so to avoid the same challenges, we have designed the plan accordingly. You will only be depositing for the 11th, 12th, 13th, and 14th month, which is 4 months.
169 - 06 Feb 2024 04:01PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Once the 4 months are completed, our Department of Student Welfare (DSW) team will assist you with your visa process. The bank statement will act as one of the required documents, and once you receive the visa, you can withdraw the amount from FBC and book the flight ticket. This will help you utilize the money as well. How does it sound?

This event holds a special place in our hearts as it brings us closer to our community, and we're counting down the days with great anticipation!

89 - 06 Feb 2024 02:12PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP:* Another thing is that Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based.  The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students‚Äô skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to¬†be¬†considered.

94 - 06 Feb 2024 02:59PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move Hamlet's application ahead and help Hamlet to write a proper statement of purpose so that he can get into the best University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on Hamlet's application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, we would require Hamlet's availability for approximately 30 minutes. If he is unavailable, he can provide you with his input, and you can proceed with the statement of purpose on his behalf. <This message was edited>
95 - 06 Feb 2024 02:59PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in Hamlet's admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.  https://goo.gl/forms/iWss6zPuOFbnGTXK2

120 - 06 Feb 2024 08:40PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Just like clockwork, we're gearing up for the seminar next week, and I couldn't resist sharing our enthusiasm with you. Your presence would truly make the event all the more meaningful, guiding you on your journey to India. Hence, with immense joy, we wanted to extend the special invitation for the Meet and Greet Seminar to you and your wonderful family.
121 - 06 Feb 2024 08:40PM - Sidhi Edoofa: And in the process of doing the same, I happened to notice that you haven't started your EWYL Program by now. In light of this, I had a discussion with Ms. Sanjana, the head of the EWYL Department, and I am happy to share that she has graciously agreed to make a special exception for you, expediting your application process.
122 - 06 Feb 2024 08:40PM - Sidhi Edoofa: As a result, I have gone ahead and created your very own dedicated EWYL Group - *Hilton EWYL23E0904*, adding both you and your parents to the mix.

Help them understand its importance and details. Once you're done, we can reconnect, have a discussion, and address any queries you may have. After resolving your concerns, I'll guide you through starting your financial security plan.  While most students can discuss this with their family the same day, I understand everyone is different. Could you let me know when you think you'll have the discussion with your family? This way, we can schedule our next session accordingly.

190 - 06 Feb 2024 12:43PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Allow me to share some more interesting details about the event with you. Recently, Edoofa hosted a conference called the Symposium of Leaders, Innovators, and Creators at Edoofa, also known as 'SLICE-CON.'
191 - 06 Feb 2024 12:43PM - Sidhi Edoofa: The conference was attended by all the Edoofians of 2023 and a few senior Edoofians from previous batches. It focused on the art of creation, innovation, and, most importantly, the mindset required to make an impact in one's career.
192 - 06 Feb 2024 12:43PM - Sidhi Edoofa: During this Industrial Visit and the conference - SLICE CON, Corporate leaders, such as the CEOs and Co-founders from renowned companies like Rage Coffee, Sirona Hygiene, Jolin New York, and more, shared their insights and experiences. These individuals are at the helm of multi-millionaire brands, leading large marketing teams. Their presence added immense value, providing students with the opportunity to engage in transformative conversations.

225 - 06 Feb 2024 02:38PM - +263 77 242 6991: Good afternoon Madam. I can have a session with you any time from now . Advise me on the correct time.

228 - 06 Feb 2024 03:12PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for confirming that. In such a case, we will have our sessions at 10:00 AM from tomorrow onwards. In the meanwhile, let us proceed with our discussion today. During our previous session, we were discussing about how the plan works for the first 10 months. With this plan for the next 10 months, I am sure you must be wondering what will happen in the next 10 months, considering you have already secured your scholarship seat with the university due to your hard work in the first 10 months. Is my understanding correct?
229 - 06 Feb 2024 03:15PM - +263 77 242 6991: Yes let's continue.
230 - 06 Feb 2024 03:59PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Let me help you with that as well. In the 11th month, you will be guided to open an FBC Mastercard bank account in Zimbabwe with a deposit of $150. The reason for this is that when you apply for your student Visa, the Embassy asks for a Bank Statement, and this account will serve that purpose.
231 - 06 Feb 2024 03:59PM - Sidhi Edoofa: We understand it might be expensive if you deposit another $1500 for the remaining 10 months in FB  Bank Zimbabwe, so to avoid the same challenges, we have designed the plan accordingly. You will only be depositing for the 11th, 12th, 13th, and 14th month, which is 4 months.
232 - 06 Feb 2024 03:59PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Once the 4 months are completed, our Department of Student Welfare (DSW) team will assist you with your visa process. The bank statement will act as one of the required documents, and once you receive the visa, you can withdraw the amount from FBC and book the flight ticket. This will help you utilize the money as well. How does it sound?
225 - 06 Feb 2024 02:38PM - +263 77 242 6991: Good afternoon Madam. I can have a session with you any time from now . Advise me on the correct time.

63 - 06 Feb 2024 01:45PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. I am doing good, thank you for asking. During our previous session, I had asked you if you have been able to discuss the Financial Secure Plan with your family. May I know if you have gotten the opportunity to do the same?
64 - 06 Feb 2024 01:56PM - +263 77 133 7570: Yes, we had a discussion and came to the conclusion that, we are not financially strong to be able to be paying current school fees and paying that for next year at the same time, l don't know if you have an alternative plan.
65 - 06 Feb 2024 01:59PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. It can get a bit challenging if you are paying the current school year fees along with saving for Patience's higher education. However, the plan does not require you to make any extra expenditures. It is only giving you the benefit of saving small amounts from today onwards, so that you do not face any financial constraints when it is time to pay for the registration amount. Allow me to help you to gain a better understanding of the same:
66 - 06 Feb 2024 02:04PM - Sidhi Edoofa: For the 2024 intake, upon receiving their offer letters from the university, students are required to pay a registration fee ranging from $500 to $1000 within 15 days as per university policy. This financial obligation poses challenges for parents and students, resulting in 20-30% of students being unable to pursue higher education in India despite qualifying for Edoofa Scholarship and securing a seat at their desired university. In response, Edoofa has introduced the Financial Secure Plan to alleviate these constraints and ensure that students can secure their scholarship seats without financial constraints. I hope we are together in this? <This message was edited>
67 - 06 Feb 2024 02:29PM - +263 77 133 7570: I understood and appreciate the plan. The challenge is for us to pay the fees concurrently we really do have a problem with that.

68 - 06 Feb 2024 02:44PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. In such a case, could you kindly let me know what is a feasible amount for you for the monthly deposits? <This message was edited>

225 - 06 Feb 2024 04:37PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. I am doing good, thank you for asking. Let us move forward with our discussion. To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is B.Tech (Mechanical Engineering) and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2025. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
226 - 06 Feb 2024 04:38PM - +263 77 756 5352: Yes that is accurate
227 - 06 Feb 2024 04:59PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. Based on our experience of over 14 years and having assisted over 5000 students from different countries, we have realized that financial planning is the most important factor when a student plans for their higher education abroad.
228 - 06 Feb 2024 04:59PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am sure that you must be aware that 20-30% of students who are admitted into universities abroad are unable to fulfill their dream and come to India due to a lack of financial planning. The funds needed for booking flights, accommodation, and covering living expenses after arrival often become overwhelming, leading to the decision to defer their admission for a year. This, in turn, creates a gap in the child's education.
229 - 06 Feb 2024 04:59PM - Sidhi Edoofa: To assist both students and parents in this regard, Edoofa Management has designed a Financial Secure Plan that aims to help you prepare for your higher educational finances without experiencing stress or last-minute rushes. I believe you must be wondering about the details of the same plan and how it helps the parents?

60 - 06 Feb 2024 02:08PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -  *Step 1: Message from the founder‚Äôs office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa‚Äôs vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.

61 - 06 Feb 2024 02:08PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you‚Äôve chosen that particular course and why you‚Äôre seeking admission in that particular school.  I hope these two steps are clear.
62 - 06 Feb 2024 02:45PM - +263 77 393 5053: Thank you, very clear.
63 - 06 Feb 2024 03:06PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 3: Introduction to the Financial Secure Plan* - Parents with children embarking on their university journey within the next one to two years face important decision-making and rigorous financial planning. Edoofa recognizes the significance of this transition and hence has introduced the Edoofa Secure Plan - a unique and systematic strategy to empower parents in financial planning and preparing for their child's tertiary education well in advance.
64 - 06 Feb 2024 03:06PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa‚Äôs recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Scholarship Offer Letter from the university would be issued next year in the month of August.  I hope you are following?
65 - 06 Feb 2024 03:25PM - +263 77 393 5053: Noted thank you
66 - 06 Feb 2024 04:01PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -  *Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. The registration fee will be paid through the savings you have accumulated visa the Financial Secure Plan. After the registration fee is paid, for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
67 - 06 Feb 2024 04:01PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.  I hope these are clear as well?
61 - 06 Feb 2024 02:08PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you‚Äôve chosen that particular course and why you‚Äôre seeking admission in that particular school.

33 - 06 Feb 2024 02:45PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am sure that you must be aware that 20-30% of students who are admitted into universities abroad are unable to fulfill their dream and come to India due to a lack of financial planning. The funds needed for booking flights, accommodation, and covering living expenses after arrival often become overwhelming, leading to the decision to defer their admission for a year. This, in turn, creates a gap in the child's education.

36 - 06 Feb 2024 03:23PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Edoofa Secure Plan is important for parents who have children joining the university for tertiary education in the next one to two years for several reasons:
37 - 06 Feb 2024 03:23PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 1. *Financial Preparedness:* The Edoofa Secure plan helps parents prepare financially for the costs after the Scholarship being offered so that they are not caught off guard.  2. *Reduced Financial Stress:* Having the Edoofa Secure Plan in place can significantly reduce the financial stress on you as parents when your child is about to enter university. Knowing that there is a dedicated fund for education expenses provides peace of mind.
38 - 06 Feb 2024 03:23PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 3. *Avoiding Debt*: Without proper savings, some parents may resort to taking out loans or accumulating credit card debt to cover their child's education costs. This Educational savings plan helps avoid the burden of debt and high-interest payments.  4. *Compound Interest:* By starting to save early and consistently contributing to the savings plan, parents can take advantage of compound interest, which can significantly increase the amount available for education expenses.
39 - 06 Feb 2024 03:23PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 5. *Flexibility and Control:* The Edoofa Secure savings plans allow parents to have greater control over their finances and how they allocate funds for their child's education. They can choose investment options that align with their risk tolerance and financial goals.  6. *Encouraging Responsibility*: Involving your child in the process of saving for their education teaches them financial responsibility and the value of higher education. It also motivates them to outperform in Academics.
40 - 06 Feb 2024 03:23PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 7. *Adapting to Unexpected Changes*: Life is full of surprises, and circumstances can change especially when there are political reforms changing each day impacting the Local Currency.

79 - 06 Feb 2024 11:22AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -  *Step 1: Message from the founder‚Äôs office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa‚Äôs vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
80 - 06 Feb 2024 11:22AM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you‚Äôve chosen that particular course and why you‚Äôre seeking admission in that particular school.  I hope these two steps are clear.
81 - 06 Feb 2024 11:55AM - +27 78 003 4261: Very clear
82 - 06 Feb 2024 12:12PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps -  *Step 3: Introduction to the Financial Secure Plan* - Parents with children embarking on their university journey within the next one to two years face important decision-making and rigorous financial planning. Edoofa recognizes the significance of this transition and hence has introduced the Edoofa Secure Plan - a unique and systematic strategy to empower parents in financial planning and preparing for their child's tertiary education well in advance.
83 - 06 Feb 2024 12:12PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa‚Äôs recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Scholarship Offer Letter from the university would be issued next year in the month of August.  I hope you are following?
84 - 06 Feb 2024 12:14PM - +27 78 003 4261: Yes, I'm still okay
85 - 06 Feb 2024 12:41PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -  *Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. The registration fee will be paid through the savings you have accumulated visa the Financial Secure Plan. After the registration fee is paid, for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
86 - 06 Feb 2024 12:41PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.  I hope these are clear as well?

88 - 06 Feb 2024 12:49PM - Sidhi Edoofa: The registration fee will be due once you receive the offer letter from the University. The application process for the 2025 intake will begin from the month of August 2024.

Since you have been one of the most dedicated students, and I see you have great aspirations, I wanted you to be a part of the same set of students and start with your future planning the right way.
109 - 06 Feb 2024 11:46AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Also, as this plan commences from the month of February, for the efficient implementation of this plan, we need to decide on a fixed date on which you will deposit $150 every month. This will provide you with the flexibility to align your finances accordingly.

We understand that every parent may not be able to make the payment on our specified date. Therefore, considering this situation, we allow them to decide the payment date according to their comfort. In light of the same, may I know the fixed date every month on which you will deposit $150?

214 - 06 Feb 2024 01:47PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Before reaching out to you today, I was going through pictures and videos from Edoofa's very first SLICE CON held last week, and that sparked my curiosity about whether you are familiar with what SLICE CON is or not?

Kindly excuse me for not being able to respond to your last message as our operational hours had concluded by then. Before we proceed with our discussion today, I would like to ask how your day has been going so far?
155 - 06 Feb 2024 02:38PM - +263 78 327 6052: Thank you for the greetings, my day is going well, and yours
156 - 06 Feb 2024 02:47PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. My day has been going good so far, thank you for asking. In our previous discussion we had discussed the details about how the plan works for the first 10 months. With this plan for the next 10 months, I am sure you must be wondering what will happen in the next 10 months, considering you have already secured your scholarship seat with the university due to your hard work in the first 10 months. Is my understanding correct?
157 - 06 Feb 2024 02:51PM - +263 78 327 6052: Yes correct
158 - 06 Feb 2024 03:17PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Let me help you with that as well. In the 11th month, you will be guided to open an FBC Mastercard bank account in Zimbabwe with a deposit of $150. The reason for this is that when you apply for your student Visa, the Embassy asks for a Bank Statement, and this account will serve that purpose.
159 - 06 Feb 2024 03:17PM - Sidhi Edoofa: We understand it might be expensive if you deposit another $1500 for the remaining 10 months in FB  Bank Zimbabwe, so to avoid the same challenges, we have designed the plan accordingly. You will only be depositing for the 11th, 12th, 13th, and 14th month, which is 4 months.
160 - 06 Feb 2024 03:17PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Once the 4 months are completed, our Department of Student Welfare (DSW) team will assist you with your visa process. The bank statement will act as one of the required documents, and once you receive the visa, you can withdraw the amount from FBC and book the flight ticket. This will help you utilize the money as well. How does it sound?
161 - 06 Feb 2024 03:36PM - +263 78 327 6052: It sounds so good but is it mandatory
162 - 06 Feb 2024 04:18PM - Sidhi Edoofa: The plan is not mandatory for the students, however it does offer benefits like $150 waiver and flexibility, and it is exclusively for the students who have enrolled into the Financial Secure Plan.  Now, from the 16th Month till the 20th month, considering it is a 6-month window, you can again continue depositing the money ($150) with Edoofa which can be used in the fee as and when required or you can decide to save this $900 of these 6 months with you as well. This is something which you are free to choose. I hope you have understood the financial secure plan now?
157 - 06 Feb 2024 02:51PM - +263 78 327 6052: Yes correct

Help them understand its importance and details. Once you're done, we can reconnect, have a discussion, and address any queries you may have. After resolving your concerns, I'll guide you through starting your financial security plan.  While most students can discuss this with their family the same day, I understand everyone is different. Could you let me know when you think you'll have the discussion with your family? This way, we can schedule our next session accordingly.

Now, you must be wondering, why only for 10 months and not for 20 months, right?
200 - 05 Feb 2024 08:45PM - +263 71 544 0530: Question 4. Which branch of law are you interested in pursuing, Civil, corporate and criminal law and why?  I am interested in pursuing criminal law because I would like to defend individuals accused of crimes and ensure that their rights are protected and also making impact on client's lives by providing them with legal representation and advocate for fair treatment in court . I'm also interested in criminal law because of the high demand of criminal lawyers because crimes are happening everyday. This demand can provide job security and a steady flow of clients. I am also interested in criminal law because of the potential for high earnings and also because successful criminal lawyers may also be able to build a strong reputation and attract a steady stream of clients.
201 - 05 Feb 2024 09:15PM - +263 71 544 0530: Question 5. What skills do you believe you have that will make you a successful lawyer, please elaborate with an example.  I believe that I can be a successful lawyer because I have strong analytical skills. At school I am into the debate club and that has helped enhance my analytical skills because debate is based on critical analysis and arguments. I also have excellent communication skills. The public speaking and debate sessions that I attend also enhance my communication skills because In debate we are taught how to present arguments and how to negotiate with the opposing parties. I also believe that I have research and writing skills and I'm also a wife reader and this can help me in becoming a successful lawyer. I also believe that I have interpersonal skills and emotional intelligence and this is because I do Sociology at school and we do researchs using interviews and that has helped enhance my interpersonal skills to build rapport with the people i will be conducting researches on

130 - 06 Feb 2024 08:26PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Tanatswa  I hope this message finds you well and filled with the same excitement that's buzzing here at Edoofa! It's that time of the year again when we eagerly anticipate our annual Meet and Greet Seminar in Harare. This event holds a special place in our hearts as it brings us closer to our community, and we're counting down the days with great anticipation!
131 - 06 Feb 2024 08:26PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Just like clockwork, we're gearing up for the seminar next week, and I couldn't resist sharing our enthusiasm with you. Your presence would truly make the event all the more meaningful, guiding you on your journey to India. Hence, with immense joy, we wanted to extend the special invitation for the Meet and Greet Seminar to you and your wonderful family.
132 - 06 Feb 2024 08:26PM - Sidhi Edoofa: And in the process of doing the same, I happened to notice that you haven't started your EWYL Program by now. In light of this, I had a discussion with Ms. Sanjana, the head of the EWYL Department, and I am happy to share that she has graciously agreed to make a special exception for you, expediting your application process.
133 - 06 Feb 2024 08:26PM - Sidhi Edoofa: As a result, I have gone ahead and created your very own dedicated EWYL Group - *Tanatswa EWYL23E0896*, adding both you and your parents to the mix. If I have missed including any other family members, they can easily join using the following link: [https://chat.whatsapp.com/EP37WYOtug3GUu6WHZmfGc].  Within the group, the EWYL team will not only guide you on the hows and whens of the EWYL Program but also share all the exciting details about the upcoming Meet and Greet Seminar in Harare.

46 - 05 Feb 2024 04:41PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Your friends discouraged you to pursue medicine by saying that it is too difficult. Is my understanding correct, Tanyaradzwa?
47 - 05 Feb 2024 05:05PM - +263 78 705 3454: Bt now l can see that nothing comes easy everything needs to hardworking so l wish to shift from chemical engineering to medicine

49 - 06 Feb 2024 10:26AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Tanyaradzwa.  I hope you are all doing well today.  I understand your concern Tanyaradzwa. However, it is also my understanding that you have a strong interest in pharmacy. May I know if I am correct?
50 - 06 Feb 2024 11:49AM - +263 78 705 3454: Yes by that time l have that interest bt now l wish to change
51 - 06 Feb 2024 11:50AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand. Your subject combination for A-Level examinations are Mathematics, Physics and Chemistry. May I know if I am correct?
52 - 06 Feb 2024 11:54AM - +263 78 705 3454: Yes you are right
53 - 06 Feb 2024 12:08PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that. In such a case Tanyaradzwa, I would like to inform you that in order to pursue medicine in India, you are required to have Biology in your subject combination. Since you do not have Biology as a subject in your A-Level examinations, I am afraid that you are not eligible to pursue medicine. However, I am glad to let you know that your subject combination make you eligible to pursue pharmacy. May I know if you are interested in going forward with it?

54 - 06 Feb 2024 12:10PM - +263 78 705 3454: But l need to try medicine first
55 - 06 Feb 2024 01:34PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand, Tanyaradzwa. Pursuing medicine is indeed a significant commitment, typically spanning an 8-year journey that requires unwavering dedication. However, given that Biology is not part of your subject combination, your foundational understanding of human anatomy may not be sufficient. Hence as Biology is a requirement in A-Level, I am afraid that you are not eligible to pursue medicine in India. As you may be aware, India's healthcare sector is highly regarded globally, making medicine one of the most sought-after degrees. To pursue medicine in India, students must clear a national-level examination known as NEET, with eligibility typically extending to those who achieve above the 99th percentile.
56 - 06 Feb 2024 01:34PM - Sidhi Edoofa: May I know if you have been able to do some research about the same? And I could not quite understand what you meant by saying that you need to try medicine first. To help me understand it better, could you also elaborate on the same?
57 - 06 Feb 2024 02:40PM - +263 78 705 3454: I get it
58 - 06 Feb 2024 02:42PM - +263 78 705 3454: But after l finish my territory, how will I be going to find a job in a foreign country like UK as you said.. Will l seek for the job on my own or the Edoofa board will do it for me
59 - 06 Feb 2024 03:04PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Surely let me help you with your concern here. After completing your studies in India you will be employable globally. All the universities that are associated with Edoofa are recognized on a global level and hence the degrees shared by them are accepted worldwide. As you may know, each university offers courses with varying durations. In Zimbabwe, it is referred to as *industrial attachment* or *work internships*. India refers to it as "" placements."" Every university affiliated with the Edoofa Program has its own dedicated placement cell. Their primary mission is to ensure that all students secure placements in their pre-final year of education. <This message was edited>

60 - 06 Feb 2024 03:04PM - Sidhi Edoofa: When students reach their pre-final year, they participate in placement drives conducted by various multinational corporations, startups, and organizations. During these drives, students go through interviews, and if they demonstrate proficiency, they end up receiving job offers from these companies. Depending on the job offer, students have the option to apply for a work permit that allows them to extend their stay in India for the duration of their employment.
61 - 06 Feb 2024 03:04PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Moreover, the EWYL program for you is specifically designed so that you as a student are able to learn the 21st-century skills which are certainly required for every student to be employable ready. Through EWYL you will boost your confidence which is going to help you in the future and with the skills learned you will definitely be employable ready. It depends upon the student how much they are willing to learn from the program.
62 - 06 Feb 2024 03:05PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I hope this provides the clarity you were seeking. Could you kindly help me out with the message I had previously shared with you Tanyaradzwa?

64 - 06 Feb 2024 03:07PM - +263 78 705 3454: Which means the only way you can get a job is through passing interview during attachments
65 - 06 Feb 2024 03:27PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is indeed correct. You will be given the opportunities to get employed with the top companies, and it will depend on you whether you are able to capitalize on it and get selected for the role.
66 - 06 Feb 2024 03:28PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. However, via pharmacy you can still pursue your dream of helping out the patients. You have an inclination towards making medicine as well. I am sure that you will be able to excel in this field! What are your thoughts on this?
67 - 06 Feb 2024 04:10PM - +263 78 705 3454: It's good as well but l need to know also for how long will it take to study pharmacy in India

72 - 06 Feb 2024 02:32PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you‚Äôve chosen that particular course and why you‚Äôre seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
73 - 06 Feb 2024 03:20PM - +263 77 540 5274: Yes they are clear
74 - 06 Feb 2024 04:00PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps -  *Step 3: Introduction to the Financial Secure Plan* - Parents with children embarking on their university journey within the next one to two years face important decision-making and rigorous financial planning. Edoofa recognizes the significance of this transition and hence has introduced the Edoofa Secure Plan - a unique and systematic strategy to empower parents in financial planning and preparing for their child's tertiary education well in advance.
75 - 06 Feb 2024 04:00PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa‚Äôs recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Scholarship Offer Letter from the university would be issued next year in the month of August.  I hope you are following?

77 - 06 Feb 2024 04:16PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -  *Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. The registration fee will be paid through the savings you have accumulated visa the Financial Secure Plan. After the registration fee is paid, for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
78 - 06 Feb 2024 04:16PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.  I hope these are clear as well?

138 - 06 Feb 2024 04:54PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 3. *Avoiding Debt*: Without proper savings, some parents may resort to taking out loans or accumulating credit card debt to cover their child's education costs. This Educational savings plan helps avoid the burden of debt and high-interest payments.  4. *Compound Interest:* By starting to save early and consistently contributing to the savings plan, parents can take advantage of compound interest, which can significantly increase the amount available for education expenses.
139 - 06 Feb 2024 04:54PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 5. *Flexibility and Control:* The Edoofa Secure savings plans allow parents to have greater control over their finances and how they allocate funds for their child's education. They can choose investment options that align with their risk tolerance and financial goals.  6. *Encouraging Responsibility*: Involving your child in the process of saving for their education teaches them financial responsibility and the value of higher education.

Under the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan, not only do you get to save an amount of $150 overall, along with that you are getting a waiver of $150.

165 - 06 Feb 2024 03:30PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. Based on our experience of over 14 years and having assisted over 5000 students from different countries, we have realized that financial planning is the most important factor when a student plans for their higher education abroad.
166 - 06 Feb 2024 03:30PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am sure that you must be aware that 20-30% of students who are admitted into universities abroad are unable to fulfill their dream and come to India due to a lack of financial planning. The funds needed for booking flights, accommodation, and covering living expenses after arrival often become overwhelming, leading to the decision to defer their admission for a year. This, in turn, creates a gap in the child's education.
164 - 06 Feb 2024 03:30PM - Tinashe Zengeya -  Estate Manager ZW: Thats correct

This, in turn, creates a gap in the child's education.
167 - 06 Feb 2024 03:30PM - Sidhi Edoofa: To assist both students and parents in this regard, Edoofa Management has designed a Financial Secure Plan that aims to help you prepare for your higher educational finances without experiencing stress or last-minute rushes. I believe you must be wondering about the details of the same plan and how it helps the parents?
168 - 06 Feb 2024 03:32PM - Tinashe Zengeya -  Estate Manager ZW: Go ahead
169 - 06 Feb 2024 04:02PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Edoofa Secure Plan is important for parents who have children joining the university for tertiary education in the next one to two years for several reasons:
170 - 06 Feb 2024 04:02PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 1. *Financial Preparedness:* The Edoofa Secure plan helps parents prepare financially for the costs after the Scholarship being offered so that they are not caught off guard.  2. *Reduced Financial Stress:* Having the Edoofa Secure Plan in place can significantly reduce the financial stress on you as parents when your child is about to enter university. Knowing that there is a dedicated fund for education expenses provides peace of mind.
171 - 06 Feb 2024 04:02PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 3. *Avoiding Debt*: Without proper savings, some parents may resort to taking out loans or accumulating credit card debt to cover their child's education costs. This Educational savings plan helps avoid the burden of debt and high-interest payments.  4. *Compound Interest:* By starting to save early and consistently contributing to the savings plan, parents can take advantage of compound interest, which can significantly increase the amount available for education expenses.
172 - 06 Feb 2024 04:02PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 5. *Flexibility and Control:* The Edoofa Secure savings plans allow parents to have greater control over their finances and how they allocate funds for their child's education. They can choose investment options that align with their risk tolerance and financial goals.  6. *Encouraging Responsibility*: Involving your child in the process of saving for their education teaches them financial responsibility and the value of higher education. It also motivates them to outperform in Academics.
173 - 06 Feb 2024 04:02PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 7. *Adapting to Unexpected Changes*: Life is full of surprises, and circumstances can change especially when there are political reforms changing each day impacting the Local Currency. Having an Edoofa Secure Plan allows parents to adapt to unexpected changes in their financial situation while still prioritizing their child's education.  8. *Peace of Mind:* Overall, having the Edoofa Secure plan provides parents with peace of mind, knowing that they are actively planning for their child's future and increasing the likelihood of providing them with a solid education.",No,No

74 - 06 Feb 2024 03:19PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -  *Step 1: Message from the founder‚Äôs office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa‚Äôs vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
75 - 06 Feb 2024 03:19PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you‚Äôve chosen that particular course and why you‚Äôre seeking admission in that particular school.  I hope these two steps are clear.",No,No

160 - 06 Feb 2024 02:52PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Winnie.  I hope that you are all doing wonderful today. How has your day been going so far?
161 - 06 Feb 2024 03:11PM - +265 999 52 82 02: Everything is on course sure what about yourself there?
162 - 06 Feb 2024 03:58PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Everything is good here as well, thank you for asking. During our previous session, you had confirmed your chosen course and year of intake. Thank you for your confirmation. Based on our experience of over 14 years and having assisted over 5000 students from different countries, we have realized that financial planning is the most important factor when a student plans for their higher education abroad.
163 - 06 Feb 2024 03:58PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am sure that you must be aware that 20-30% of students who are admitted into universities abroad are unable to fulfill their dream and come to India due to a lack of financial planning. The funds needed for booking flights, accommodation, and covering living expenses after arrival often become overwhelming, leading to the decision to defer their admission for a year. This, in turn, creates a gap in the child's education.
164 - 06 Feb 2024 03:58PM - Sidhi Edoofa: To assist both students and parents in this regard, Edoofa Management has designed a Financial Secure Plan that aims to help you prepare for your higher educational finances without experiencing stress or last-minute rushes. I believe you must be wondering about the details of the same plan and how it helps the parents?
165 - 06 Feb 2024 04:01PM - +265 999 52 82 02: Yes for sure...but I know that probably you've an alternative to this may be?
166 - 06 Feb 2024 04:16PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I could not quite understand what you mean to say by alternative here. Could you kindly elaborate sir?

167 - 06 Feb 2024 04:25PM - +265 999 52 82 02: I mean the assistance by securing a financial plan do that parents like myself should at least be not burdened for the expenses as expressed above
168 - 06 Feb 2024 04:52PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Yes, Edoofa management has curated a plan that will help the parents and students. Edoofa Secure Plan is important for parents who have children joining the university for tertiary education in the next one to two years for several reasons:
169 - 06 Feb 2024 04:52PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 1. *Financial Preparedness:* The Edoofa Secure plan helps parents prepare financially for the costs after the Scholarship being offered so that they are not caught off guard.  2. *Reduced Financial Stress:* Having the Edoofa Secure Plan in place can significantly reduce the financial stress on you as parents when your child is about to enter university. Knowing that there is a dedicated fund for education expenses provides peace of mind.
170 - 06 Feb 2024 04:52PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 3. *Avoiding Debt*: Without proper savings, some parents may resort to taking out loans or accumulating credit card debt to cover their child's education costs. This Educational savings plan helps avoid the burden of debt and high-interest payments.  4. *Compound Interest:* By starting to save early and consistently contributing to the savings plan, parents can take advantage of compound interest, which can significantly increase the amount available for education expenses.
171 - 06 Feb 2024 04:52PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 5. *Flexibility and Control:* The Edoofa Secure savings plans allow parents to have greater control over their finances and how they allocate funds for their child's education. They can choose investment options that align with their risk tolerance and financial goals.  6. *Encouraging Responsibility*: Involving your child in the process of saving for their education teaches them financial responsibility and the value of higher education. It also motivates them to outperform in Academics.
172 - 06 Feb 2024 04:52PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 7. *Adapting to Unexpected Changes*: Life is full of surprises, and circumstances can change especially when there are political reforms changing each day impacting the Local Currency. Having an Edoofa Secure Plan allows parents to adapt to unexpected changes in their financial situation while still prioritizing their child's education.  8. *Peace of Mind:* Overall, having the Edoofa Secure plan provides parents with peace of mind, knowing that they are actively planning for their child's future and increasing the likelihood of providing them with a solid education.",No,Yes

I'm an Upper 6 student doing MPC(Pure mathematics, physics and chemistry), hoping to do civil engineering. My school fee is $300 per term. Along with what I want to study, my strength concerning my attitude is that if I start something, I'm determined to finish. Usually l don't give up on something, unless the bridge isn't firm, it's better to fail rather than quiting and also my weakness is that if l quite something, I'll never attempt to try it again. And then Academically, l love physics more than Chemistry though at first it was a little bit difficult. I'm good in mathematics.  I like singing very much, infact I'm a song writer (gospel songs cause lm a Christian). I'm also musician l can play a keyboard, drums and guiter. But I'm based in playing lead guiter  I'm from a family of 3.I live with both of my parent, my dad being a driver at a construction company (Rosam Builders) and my mom a is self employed person. She has a small tuck shop having brains and some cosmetics. Both my parents have no any educational qualifications. My dad left school around the age of 12 because of the death of parents. My mother aslo left school at grade seven because of the death of her father. They lived a tough life. I've a brother after me in form 4, turning 17 on 6 Oct and the last born is a girl turning 6 on 22 March. My mother is pregnant so very soon we'll four.

125 - 06 Feb 2024 09:16AM - Garima Edoofa: Can you please answer this question?
126 - 06 Feb 2024 09:29AM - +260 96 6221187: Yes I do it can benefit me
127 - 06 Feb 2024 09:30AM - Garima Edoofa: That is great to know, so now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food, and accommodation*, which means for the monthly family cost of the student‚Äôs education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.  _*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
128 - 06 Feb 2024 09:31AM - Garima Edoofa: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.
129 - 06 Feb 2024 09:31AM - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
155 - 06 Feb 2024 09:48AM - Garima Edoofa: Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :  1.*Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*‚Äã: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses,which is completely waived off.  2.*Employability through practical training*‚Äã: We believe Students shouldn't just learn in theory, they should gain real-world experience instead of academic theory. That is why we help them by designing a practical employment oriented curriculum that helps students pick up job skills needed to be employable.   3.*Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing and involving. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What‚Äôs more, students earn scholarship credits in the process, thereby further reducing the burden of the cost of their education.   4.*Higher Education Concierge*‚Äã: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.
156 - 06 Feb 2024 09:48AM - Garima Edoofa: So, after looking over the facts that distinguish Edoofa, which of the four points did you appreciate the most?
157 - 06 Feb 2024 02:54PM - +260 96 6221187: The fourth one
158 - 06 Feb 2024 03:06PM - Garima Edoofa: I am delighted to know that you have been looking for the same.   Alright Chipego, basically, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
159 - 06 Feb 2024 04:01PM - +260 96 6221187: Yes mom
160 - 06 Feb 2024 04:20PM - Garima Edoofa: Alright Chipego, basically once we complete your counseling session I would give you time to properly discuss about your entire application once again with your family members so that they too could have much better clarity regarding the same. Meanwhile, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.  Are you ready?
161 - 06 Feb 2024 04:23PM - +260 96 6221187: Yes I'm
162 - 06 Feb 2024 04:51PM - Garima Edoofa: Chipego as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn‚Äôt given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.  *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?* <This message was edited>
163 - 06 Feb 2024 07:16PM - +260 96 6221187: It will cost will be $1500-$2250
164 - 06 Feb 2024 10:18PM - Garima Edoofa: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.

Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education.  Don‚Äôt you think so?

(The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026).

However, the Academic Board has mentioned that they are willing to consider Marlvine's Application if the family faces a challenge in completing the required $200 within the stipulated timeline. As a remedial you can complete a part fee of $100 within the first 7 days, then $100 by the next 21 days, and finally the remaining $150 would be completed in the next 30 days. All in all, for $350 you will have time of 58 days.  Looking at the current situation, I feel this would be convenient for you and your family, isn't it?

328 - 06 Feb 2024 01:22PM - Garima Edoofa: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.  I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
329 - 06 Feb 2024 01:22PM - Garima Edoofa: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-  1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.  2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program.  Or  A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
330 - 06 Feb 2024 01:22PM - Garima Edoofa: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India  I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
329 - 06 Feb 2024 01:22PM - Garima Edoofa: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-  1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.  2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program.  Or  A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
330 - 06 Feb 2024 01:22PM - Garima Edoofa: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India  I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.

332 - 06 Feb 2024 01:22PM - Garima Edoofa: Ideally as you know, the tentative dates: 1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 13th or 14th February  2024 for $200 and the 13th or 14th of march  for the remaining $150. 2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 13th or 14th February 2024. Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?",No,No

8 - 06 Feb 2024 08:32AM - Gurvinder: Good Morning Beene Sakala!  I am Mr Gurvinder Singh, Senior Career Counselor at Edoofa  Welcome to the Edoofa Scholarship Counselling Session  Before we begin with the session, I would like to ask you, what prior understanding you have about the Edoofa Scholarship Program
9 - 06 Feb 2024 08:35AM - +260 777754748: It‚Äôs a program with a vision to make affordable higher education available for all
10 - 06 Feb 2024 10:01AM - Gurvinder: That is correct, let me brief you more.
11 - 06 Feb 2024 10:01AM - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*  One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
12 - 06 Feb 2024 10:01AM - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
13 - 06 Feb 2024 10:01AM - Gurvinder: EDOOFA has commended the new government for its dedicated efforts and positive changes in the education sector, including the elimination of school fees, an increase in the number of teachers, and a focus on protecting vulnerable learners, particularly adolescent girls. *Edoofa is proud to support the government in its mission to transform the education sector and achieve sustainable development, aimed at ensuring quality education that is inclusive and equitable for all by 2030.*
14 - 06 Feb 2024 10:01AM - Gurvinder: With the influx of students from Zimbabwe, we recorded more than 1500 students to the program in each of the last two years. Having a strong network and grasp of more than 100 schools with a panel of Headmasters, teachers, parents, and other educators, we now look to replicate our success in Zambia as well where we have already begun enrolling students since the last 6 months and we have closed 2023 intake with over 1500 students.

17 - 06 Feb 2024 10:02AM - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
18 - 06 Feb 2024 10:04AM - +260 777754748: Yes, it is
19 - 06 Feb 2024 10:46AM - Gurvinder: Okay so Beene, as we start your counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship.  In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics.  *1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day‚Äôs span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation.  *2. Parent‚Äôs Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.  Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
20 - 06 Feb 2024 10:48AM - +260 777754748: Yes
21 - 06 Feb 2024 11:52AM - Gurvinder: Now Beene, I would like to know you better as a student.

Who will be supporting you financially for your higher education abroad? 7. Do you have any siblings? if yes, what do they do? 8. May I know which school do you study at and in which province is it located along with that how much was your per-term fee in Grade 12?  Please elaborate on your answers and answer them in points, so that I can understand your application more briefly and assist you in a better way

8 - 06 Feb 2024 08:33AM - Gurvinder: Good Morning Betsheba Nambeyi!  I am Mr Gurvinder Singh, Senior Career Counselor at Edoofa  Welcome to the Edoofa Scholarship Counselling Session  Before we begin with the session, I would like to ask you, what prior understanding you have about the Edoofa Scholarship Program
9 - 06 Feb 2024 08:36AM - +260 777193926: Good morning
10 - 06 Feb 2024 08:48AM - +260 777193926: This is a program that offers scholarships to go and study abroad
11 - 06 Feb 2024 10:02AM - Gurvinder: That is correct, let me brief you more.
12 - 06 Feb 2024 10:02AM - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*  One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
13 - 06 Feb 2024 10:02AM - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
14 - 06 Feb 2024 10:02AM - Gurvinder: EDOOFA has commended the new government for its dedicated efforts and positive changes in the education sector, including the elimination of school fees, an increase in the number of teachers, and a focus on protecting vulnerable learners, particularly adolescent girls. *Edoofa is proud to support the government in its mission to transform the education sector and achieve sustainable development, aimed at ensuring quality education that is inclusive and equitable for all by 2030.*
15 - 06 Feb 2024 10:02AM - Gurvinder: With the influx of students from Zimbabwe, we recorded more than 1500 students to the program in each of the last two years. Having a strong network and grasp of more than 100 schools with a panel of Headmasters, teachers, parents, and other educators, we now look to replicate our success in Zambia as well where we have already begun enrolling students since the last 6 months and we have closed 2023 intake with over 1500 students.

17 - 06 Feb 2024 10:03AM - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
18 - 06 Feb 2024 10:03AM - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
19 - 06 Feb 2024 12:20PM - +260 777193926: Alright thanks
20 - 06 Feb 2024 12:36PM - Gurvinder: Okay so Betsheba, as we start your counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship.  In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics.  *1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day‚Äôs span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation.  *2. Parent‚Äôs Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.  Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
21 - 06 Feb 2024 01:29PM - +260 777193926: Yes
22 - 06 Feb 2024 01:31PM - Gurvinder: Now Betsheba, I would like to know you better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about yourself, your career aspiration do include sharing about:-  1. Your highest education level? 2. The course you would like to study? 3. What do your parents do? 4. What is your parent‚Äôs highest education level? 5. Who has been supporting you for your Education so far? 6. Who will be supporting you financially for your higher education abroad? 7. Do you have any siblings? if yes, what do they do? 8. May I know which school do you study at and in which province is it located along with that how much was your per-term fee in Grade 12?  Please elaborate on your answers and answer them in points, so that I can understand your application more briefly and assist you in a better way
23 - 06 Feb 2024 01:33PM - +260 777193926: Alright thanks üòä I‚Äôll answer

410 - 06 Feb 2024 12:04PM - Gurvinder: @263712922518, since you must have seen, there are two modes of fee payments mentioned:-  1. Direct Bank Transfer to our Parent Company's account 2. Deposit in our associate's account over there in Zimbabwe  Which mode according to you would be convenient, so that I can brief you in-depth about that particular mode?
411 - 06 Feb 2024 04:06PM - +263 71 292 2518: Good day to you was trying to run around to see if I can get the monies, however I might go with the first  option. You may go ahead & explain for me which one might be advantageous
412 - 06 Feb 2024 04:07PM - Gurvinder: Basically you see in the first mode, the Direct Bank Transfer Mode, the transfer charges which are to be borne by the parents of the student ranges between $100 to $120 which become quite high for a lot of parents considering the economic situation in Zimbabwe itself. So as not every student is in a position to cater for an additional $100 to $120 just as transfer charge, the second mode was introduced, wherein, it is the Bank deposit in Mr. Charles's Account, in this the transfer charges get divided amongst 10 students resulting in an equivalent bearing of 12.5% at the end.  So as you can see in the letter that there is a Bank deposit in, Mr. Charles Jerera (Retired Education Officer)'s account as he is our Associated Partner there in Zimbabwe, Since 2020 there have been over 1400+ students who have been assisted by Mr Charles inorder to complete their enrollment formalities as well as university fee payments after arriving in India.

413 - 06 Feb 2024 04:07PM - Gurvinder: Therefore the fee can also be paid through him. Since his account is a NOSTRO Account which only holds USD itself, therefore the necessary amount including the transfer charges in this mode itself would be $394 ($350 + $44 transfer charges), and the same details are as below:-  BANK NAME: FBC  SWIFT CODE: FBCPZWHA  ACC NAME: CHARLES JERERA  ACC NUMBER: 5333038014048828  CONTACT NUMBER: +263 77 376 9854

Let us say a student has 5 subjects and scored 7 in all of them creating an aggregate of 35. This would be the maximum limit for eligibility. All students scoring an aggregate within this range would meet the academic requirement for the program. The minimum requirement was higher before the pandemic but during the pandemic, a lot of students failed to receive enough resources and Educational support which we had shared with the Universities and Ministries due to which the requirements have been lowered but I always encourage my students to target for maximum to increase the chances of Higher Quantum of Scholarship!

78 - 06 Feb 2024 01:15PM - Gurvinder: That is really great Mwayi I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations,  However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.  Are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way inorder to transform your career dear?
139 - 06 Feb 2024 04:28PM - Gurvinder: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.  These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.  *What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
140 - 06 Feb 2024 04:30PM - +265 897 61 86 86: Indeed it will benefit me
141 - 06 Feb 2024 04:31PM - Gurvinder: I am delighted to hear that Mwayi, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student‚Äôs education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.  _*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_

14 - 06 Feb 2024 09:00AM - Gurvinder: It is a pleasure to connect with you today Mr Ndunda, I have already added Naomi in the group,  You can address me as Mr Gurvinder, we do have Mr Piiyush, Head of Counselling and  Mr Jyotishman, Head of Admissions who will be evaluating your responses for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
15 - 06 Feb 2024 09:01AM - +260 97 7760225: Well noted Mr Gurvinder
16 - 06 Feb 2024 09:11AM - +260 772220291: The Edoofa scholarship program is a scholarship and not a sponsorship program it offers various scholarships based on academic performance,financial need and other criteria,it helps in enabling students to access quality education opportunities by paying 50 percent in the studies a student would want to partake in
17 - 06 Feb 2024 09:12AM - +260 772220291: This is the understanding I have for the program Mr Gurvinder
18 - 06 Feb 2024 10:12AM - Gurvinder: That is correct, let me brief you more.
19 - 06 Feb 2024 10:12AM - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*  One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
20 - 06 Feb 2024 10:12AM - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
21 - 06 Feb 2024 10:12AM - Gurvinder: EDOOFA has commended the new government for its dedicated efforts and positive changes in the education sector, including the elimination of school fees, an increase in the number of teachers, and a focus on protecting vulnerable learners, particularly adolescent girls. *Edoofa is proud to support the government in its mission to transform the education sector and achieve sustainable development, aimed at ensuring quality education that is inclusive and equitable for all by 2030.*
22 - 06 Feb 2024 10:12AM - Gurvinder: With the influx of students from Zimbabwe, we recorded more than 1500 students to the program in each of the last two years. Having a strong network and grasp of more than 100 schools with a panel of Headmasters, teachers, parents, and other educators, we now look to replicate our success in Zambia as well where we have already begun enrolling students since the last 6 months and we have closed 2023 intake with over 1500 students.
26 - 06 Feb 2024 10:43AM - +260 772220291: Yes of course
27 - 06 Feb 2024 10:45AM - +260 772220291: Does the program carter for up keep as well as accomodation
28 - 06 Feb 2024 10:59AM - Gurvinder: Please, you will be informed about everything, let me continue the counselling session.
29 - 06 Feb 2024 11:00AM - +260 772220291: What are the terms and conditions stipulated to this condition.What do you expect from the applicants
30 - 06 Feb 2024 11:00AM - +260 772220291: Ok
31 - 06 Feb 2024 11:58AM - Gurvinder: Okay so Naomi, as we start your counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship.  In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics.  *1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day‚Äôs span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation.  *2. Parent‚Äôs Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.  Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
32 - 06 Feb 2024 12:04PM - +260 772220291: I am confident that I have what it takes
33 - 06 Feb 2024 12:19PM - Gurvinder: That is great, Naomi.
34 - 06 Feb 2024 12:20PM - Gurvinder: Now Naomi, I would like to know you better as a student.

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics.  *1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day‚Äôs span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation.  *2. Parent‚Äôs Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.  Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?

Since the time you applied for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, I was hoping to connect with you and take your application forward to check your eligibility for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, but since you didn‚Äôt respond, I am afraid I will have to put a formal closure to your application.

Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student‚Äôs education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.  _*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_

I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly.

I hope to get a positive response from you soon.

11 - 06 Feb 2024 09:36AM - +260 771940162: The Edoofa scholarship program it deals with 50 to 100 percent scholarships to eligible and deserving students across the globe . Through the Edoofa program students have an opportunity to gain technical skills and have a chance to be financially independent with their school expenses reducing the revenue stress on parents through the earn while you learn the program <This message was edited>
12 - 06 Feb 2024 10:17AM - Gurvinder: That is correct, let me brief you more.
13 - 06 Feb 2024 10:17AM - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*  One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
14 - 06 Feb 2024 10:17AM - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
15 - 06 Feb 2024 10:17AM - Gurvinder: EDOOFA has commended the new government for its dedicated efforts and positive changes in the education sector, including the elimination of school fees, an increase in the number of teachers, and a focus on protecting vulnerable learners, particularly adolescent girls. *Edoofa is proud to support the government in its mission to transform the education sector and achieve sustainable development, aimed at ensuring quality education that is inclusive and equitable for all by 2030.*
16 - 06 Feb 2024 10:17AM - Gurvinder: With the influx of students from Zimbabwe, we recorded more than 1500 students to the program in each of the last two years. Having a strong network and grasp of more than 100 schools with a panel of Headmasters, teachers, parents, and other educators, we now look to replicate our success in Zambia as well where we have already begun enrolling students since the last 6 months and we have closed 2023 intake with over 1500 students.

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics.  *1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day‚Äôs span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation.  *2. Parent‚Äôs Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.  Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?

141 - 06 Feb 2024 03:46PM - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
142 - 06 Feb 2024 03:46PM - Gurvinder: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.  I hope you can now realize how we are different isn‚Äôt it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
143 - 06 Feb 2024 03:48PM - +260 771940162: Wow yes that's what I really want üòÅ
144 - 06 Feb 2024 03:50PM - Gurvinder: Alright Ruth, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.

166 - 06 Feb 2024 12:28PM - Gurvinder: Tashinga as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn‚Äôt given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.  *Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
167 - 06 Feb 2024 12:36PM - +263 71 679 7771: You will up spending more  money around $1500-$2500
168 - 06 Feb 2024 12:53PM - Gurvinder: Exactly Tashinga, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.

As a single parent, juggling the responsibilities of a small-scale farmer and the mother of two daughters, she has persevered. Her journey with Edoofa is a testament to how dedicated individuals can overcome obstacles. Mrs. Ruth's experience with Edoofa is a testament to the transformative impact our programs can have. She not only managed her family's needs but also seized the opportunity for her daughters to achieve higher education. The support and guidance she received from Edoofa were instrumental in her success. The process was challenging, yet incredibly rewarding. Mrs. Ruth's determination, combined with Edoofa's assistance, has paved the way for a brighter future.

210 - 06 Feb 2024 06:16PM - Harmehak: So, Mr Petros, now can you tell me:-  1. What is the name of the course that your child would be studying through the Edoofa Program?  2. What is the country finalized for your child's higher education?  3. What is the average cost for studies in India without a scholarship?  4. What is the annual fee you will pay if found eligible for the program?  5. What is the enrollment fee of the Edoofa Program?  6. If your child is found eligible for the program in how many days you will have to pay the first part of their enrollment fee?  7. After receiving your offer letter from the Edoofa Academic Board, you will have to pay your registration fee in order to finalise your university admission and reserve your scholarship seat. This registration fee will be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?
211 - 06 Feb 2024 06:30PM - +263 77 391 3337: 1 Banchelor of Science in Agriculture 2 India 3 $6000-8000 4 $2000-3000 per year 5 $350 6 the next seven days 7 yes I am clear about this
212 - 06 Feb 2024 06:55PM - Harmehak: Very correct, Mr Petros!  So as a parent, are you thoroughly willing to support Believe's higher education in India both mentally and financially?
213 - 06 Feb 2024 07:02PM - +263 77 391 3337: Am willing yes
214 - 06 Feb 2024 07:03PM - Harmehak: Well received please, you see as per my experience over the last couple of years, I have been fortunate to have assisted over hundreds of students in achieving their career aspiration through the Edoofa Program.  One of my key observations during helping out these students was regarding what was the common trait amongst students who are today having the best of their time in India through the Edoofa Program, and honestly I was able to come down to only one aspect that is FAMILY SUPPORT.
215 - 06 Feb 2024 07:03PM - Harmehak: You see in this journey of any child's higher education, there are three major contributors  1. Student himself/herself 2. FAMILY 3. EDOOFA PROGAM  Now all the students who are today successfully a part of the Edoofa Program, had all these three contributors working together towards the common goal which is student's success and ensuring that by the time student completes his/her higher education they should be able to get good paying jobs.  Even if any one of the contributor does not perform to the best of their abilities, Student's overall success is hampered. Let me give you a few examples  *In the event if student wishes to work hard, Edoofa is willing to support but the Family is not willing to support, the student will not be successful under the program*  *In the event if student wishes to work hard, Family is willing to support, but Edoofa's academic Board doesn't find the student worthy, the student will not be successful under the program*  *In the event if Family is willing to support, Edoofa's Academic Board is willing to support but the student doesn't wishes to work hard, then also the student will not be successful under the program*
216 - 06 Feb 2024 07:03PM - Harmehak: During the evaluation of your child's application so far, the Academic Board has evaluated a few aspects, such as student's willingness to work hard, and family's willingness to support the student so that the student can achieve what he/she has aspired. However now in your interview ahead, the Academic Board would be strictly be evaluating the Family's support towards the child higher education.  *As you know in the event if your child is found eligible, you would have to complete a certain part of the formalities within the 7 day timeline, so may I know regarding the same, are you willing to support your child to the fullest?*

218 - 06 Feb 2024 07:57PM - Harmehak: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.  I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
219 - 06 Feb 2024 07:57PM - Harmehak: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-  1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.  2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program.  Or  A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
220 - 06 Feb 2024 07:57PM - Harmehak: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India  I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.
221 - 06 Feb 2024 07:57PM - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
222 - 06 Feb 2024 07:57PM - Harmehak: Ideally as you know, the tentative dates:  1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 13th or 14th February 2024 for $200 and the 13th or 14th of March for the remaining $150.  2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 13th or 14th February 2024.

218 - 06 Feb 2024 06:00PM - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*  Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!

And with that a detailed description of your family background, what do your parents do *(Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work)?*, what is their highest education level along with if you have any siblings, please?
36 - 06 Feb 2024 10:37AM - Harmehak: I appreciate, Mr Sithole!
37 - 06 Feb 2024 11:05AM - Harmehak: I await your response, Unity.
38 - 06 Feb 2024 12:33PM - +263 77 445 3185: We are experiencing network challenges.  But we are there. Its on and off.
150 - 06 Feb 2024 05:12PM - Harmehak: In simple words Mr Sithole, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
151 - 06 Feb 2024 05:13PM - Harmehak: However as per my experience, I can share with you that *if she is able to perform and clear all these criteria with a high passing grade, she would be eligible for higher quantum of Scholarship*, in which you will just have to pay a minimal fee of *$1200-$1800*, Which would cover your entire fees be it food, accommodation, Tuition etc.
152 - 06 Feb 2024 05:15PM - +263 77 445 3185: Noted. Is it for a semester or for the course.  Also, is there option of instalments payments,,,?
153 - 06 Feb 2024 05:17PM - +263 77 445 3185: Because what is important for is for me to plan for such costs and also to know the deadlines payment for August intake.

155 - 06 Feb 2024 05:53PM - Harmehak: I appreciate your thoughts!
156 - 06 Feb 2024 05:54PM - Harmehak: Let me provide you a better clarity.
157 - 06 Feb 2024 05:55PM - Harmehak: Now you see Mr Sithole, the amazing aspect about this is that the annual fee of the student which includes the remaining cost of tuition fees, food and accommodation expenses will have to be paid in semester wise which would be in installments of 6 months each that too after the student arrives at the University.  So for example, if after the scholarship the annual fee of the student comes to be let us say $1800, now to the University it has to be paid Semester Wise ( 2 Installments of 6 months each). Therefore it is paid like $900 in the first semester and $900 in the next semester, but there would be the Earn While You Learn Program which would help the student in reducing the semester fee as well.  Usually what parents do is, since after arriving in India students do get an Indian Bank Account opened, parents can also deposit the fee on a monthly basis into the students account and the student in one go can complete the semester fee after the interval of 6 months itself!

Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*  One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
41 - 06 Feb 2024 10:36AM - Keshav Edoofa: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
42 - 06 Feb 2024 10:37AM - Keshav Edoofa: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program.

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics.  *1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day‚Äôs span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation.  *2. Parent‚Äôs Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

83 - 06 Feb 2024 04:14PM - +263 71 378 2938: No am not familiar with it
84 - 06 Feb 2024 04:39PM - Kunal: Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth!  In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc,it is still beyond the reach of many. With the Edoofa Scholarship Program,the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process. This reduced cost includes: *1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)* *2. Basic University Expenses (Library,Wifi,Laundry,etc.)* *3. Food* *4. Accommodation*

215 - 06 Feb 2024 10:18AM - Kunal: That is fine You must have seen, there are two modes of fee payments mentioned:-  1. Direct Bank Transfer to our Parent Company's account 2. Deposit in our associate's account over there in Zimbabwe  Which mode according to you would be convenient, so that I can brief you in-depth about that particular mode? <This message was edited>
216 - 06 Feb 2024 10:20AM - +263 77 936 6260: Depositing in your associate's account is the best
217 - 06 Feb 2024 10:37AM - Kunal: Let me explain that to you Basically you see in the first mode, the Direct Bank Transfer Mode, the transfer charges which are to be borne by the parents of the student range between $100 to $120 which become quite high for a lot of parents considering the economic situation in Zimbabwe itself. So as not every student is in a position to cater for an additional $100 to $120 just as a transfer charge, the second mode was introduced, wherein, it is the Bank deposit in Mr. Charles's Account, in this the transfer charges get divided amongst 10 students resulting in an equivalent bearing of 12.5% at the end.
218 - 06 Feb 2024 10:37AM - Kunal: So as you can see in the letter that there is a Bank deposit in, Mr. Charles Jerera (Retired Education Officer)'s account as he is our Associated Partner there in Zimbabwe, Since 2020 there have been over 1400+ students who have been assisted by Mr Charles inorder to complete their enrollment formalities as well as university fee payments after arriving in India.
219 - 06 Feb 2024 10:37AM - Kunal: Therefore the fee can also be paid through him. Since his account is a NOSTRO Account which only holds USD itself, therefore the necessary amount including the transfer charges in this mode itself would be $394 ($350 + $44 transfer charges), and the same details are as below:-  BANK NAME: FBC  SWIFT CODE: FBCPZWHA  ACC NAME: CHARLES JERERA  ACC NUMBER: 5333038014048828  CONTACT NUMBER: +263 77 376 9854

59 - 06 Feb 2024 11:50AM - Kunal: Let me brief you that, I want to brief you that the criteria before the pandemic was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is *a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*  Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.

61 - 06 Feb 2024 12:00PM - Kunal: May I know with your interests in Soil Science, why didn't you opt for Biology at A level?
62 - 06 Feb 2024 12:02PM - +263 78 086 4728: By the time I was looking for the vacancy, there was no   biology teacher at school, unfortunately the teacher came this year
63 - 06 Feb 2024 12:12PM - Kunal: I understand While Biology at A level is a prerequisite for eligibility in Soil Science, I recognize your career aspirations and passion for the field. Rest assured, I have identified a more suitable course option that aligns with your interests and goals.  *Bachelor of Arts in Geography*  Students gain a holistic understanding of how geographical factors influence soil formation, distribution, and utilization. They learn to analyze spatial patterns of soil properties, assess soil quality and fertility, and devise sustainable land management strategies. This interdisciplinary approach equips graduates with valuable skills applicable in various fields, including agriculture, environmental science, urban planning, and natural resource management.
72 - 06 Feb 2024 02:17PM - Kunal: As we've thoroughly covered the course details can you tell me how you see yourself in 5 years after your course and If you are provided with this career option and how can being an Edoofian enable you to achieve your career goals?
73 - 06 Feb 2024 02:28PM - +263 78 086 4728: As I was going through your mails , I heard that you provide a quality  education so I think after completing my course I will be someone who's changed and who is able to solve problems, and I will manage to do anything since I will be trained
74 - 06 Feb 2024 02:33PM - Kunal: I appreciate and admire your foresightedness at the same time. I believe you will be researching more about the course in detail.  So now as you are aware that Edoofa Recommends *India* as a Higher Education Platform May I know what is your knowledge or what have you researched about India and the Indian Education System?

77 - 06 Feb 2024 02:59PM - Kunal: Alright Favour Speaking specifically about Parul University  First of all, the degrees shared by Parul Universities are not recognized on a global level, if after spending $3000 for education abroad, degrees are not considered in other countries, would that be a worthwhile investment?  *The most important reason is that the University isn't ranked under the  NIRF ranking under the Ministry of Education of the Government of India!*  https://www.nirfindia.org/2021/Ranking.html  This is the Official Website of the ranking of Colleges and Universities by the Ministry of Education under the Government of India and you will be surprised to see that Parul University *is not even a part of this ranking*

79 - 06 Feb 2024 03:01PM - Kunal: Let me share some information about India and various global leaders who are Indian alumni  *1.

95 - 06 Feb 2024 03:43PM - +263 78 086 4728: Thank you. I don't know how it is done
96 - 06 Feb 2024 03:44PM - Kunal: Let me tell you how Edoofa helps Edoofians bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the *Earn While You Learn Program*  The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student‚Äôs performance) that are equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable. The Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing ‚Äì just to name a few.  The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies and needs, converting an Individual into a market-ready professional. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
97 - 06 Feb 2024 03:44PM - Kunal: *Projects with Brands and Companies: -* The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, such as: *Africa Global Radio-* The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project and hear from the CEO about the exposures of the Edoofa program. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4DAP24ZuY4&authuser=0 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0 *Skooqs-* This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.  *Recruitment Partners:-* Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:- Nigenuis Skooqs Success Magazine TIA Organics  *Webinars:-* We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars regularly with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: - -Digitalization of Industries: How to Become an all-rounder in the Ever-changing Professional World by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade. -How to Network like a Boss by Ms Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi -How to be industry-ready before graduating? Hear it from an Employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu -It‚Äôs Never Too Late to Pursue Your Passion: My Journey from Real Estate to Entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje -Decoding the Science of Personal Branding by Mr, Simon Maingi

99 - 06 Feb 2024 03:48PM - +263 78 086 4728: It really sounds interesting. I think EWYL  is important because it can make a student someone who have self reliance , so I also think that I will benefit from it
100 - 06 Feb 2024 04:07PM - Kunal: Indeed, If I have to help you explain how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable compared to Local Universities, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now, if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, bringing the cost further down to $1000 per year including the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student‚Äôs education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month. _This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly._  *You can see this even in this scholarship credit certificate where one of our star performers, our Proud Edoodians  Masinire Miriam earned $1965 within a year.* I hope you can now realize the power of the EWYL program to reduce the financial pressure on families?

103 - 06 Feb 2024 04:10PM - Kunal: Great, Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, a few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :  *1. Expert Career Counselling:* We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counsellors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.  *2. Affordability through guaranteed scholarships:* Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off.  *3. Earn While You Learn:* The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing our students for the real world.  *4.Higher Education Concierge:* A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.*  After going through these facts that make Edoofa different, which one out of the 4 did you feel is the most significant?

268 - 06 Feb 2024 10:01AM - Kunal: Good morning, Mrs Memory
269 - 06 Feb 2024 10:01AM - Kunal: Well I understand your concern. In my experience as an education and career counselor, I have seen one of the biggest concerns students across Africa tend to have is a fear of scams and false promises. Now I can understand based on what you might have read that you and your family are perhaps facing this concern as well.  However we have a large number of positive reviews and if your concerns were genuine, we would have never gotten positive reviews in the first place. I would like you to go through our Google Reviews and check out the hundreds of positive reviews we have received from our student community. As far as the negative reviews are concerned, they are provided by a few students who were rejected during their admission process which led them to react this way. Some students are unable to handle rejection and therefore tend to discredit the institution itself. This is the case for every university.  The biggest proof of our program's genuineness is the African student community we have here in India who are receiving a quality higher education experience. Do let me know if you wish to speak to one of our scholarship beneficiaries, and even with their parents please!

India is also home to many world-renowned universities, including the University of Delhi, the Indian Institute of Technology, and the Indian Institute of Management.  The Indian education system is known for its rigorous academics and focus on practical learning. In addition l have learned that the Indian education system is divided into three levels: primary, secondary, and higher education. Primary education covers grades 1-8, and secondary education covers grades 9-12.  After secondary school, students can pursue higher education at a university or other educational institution and in India, there are three main types of universities: central universities, state universities, and private universities.  Central universities are established by the central government, while state universities are established by state governments.  Private universities are established by private organizations or individuals.

124 - 06 Feb 2024 10:50AM - Pallika Edoofa: That‚Äôs alright, Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India compared to other global hubs.  In India, international students face an average expense of *$6000-$8000 annually.* While this is very low as compared to the Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc where the cost of education ranges from $15000-$35000 annually, it is still beyond the reach of many.  With the Edoofa Scholarship Program, the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000 per annum* for the students who are found eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility Check Process. This reduced cost includes: *1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)* *2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Laundry, etc.)* *3. Food* *4. Accommodation*

252 - 06 Feb 2024 12:50PM - Pallika Edoofa: I understand that Josephine! did you manage to compare the cost of education in Zimbabwe with that through the Edoofa Scholarship Program? <This message was edited>
253 - 06 Feb 2024 12:50PM - Pallika Edoofa: Our Senior Academician was in Zimbabwe for 4 months last year and let me highlight the importance of this opportunity for Zimbabwean students. I want you to think about this situation, where you are studying at UZ. The Tuition fee at UZ ranges from $1000-$1200 per annum with hikes most of the years. The living expenses in Zimbabwe are much more costly than in India. Even the staple diet sadza costs $1 per meal. So you have to spend around $3 per or more per day for meals. A taxi ride for a short distance costs $1, Wi-Fi costs $120 per month, the living rents are high with hikes and the unemployment rates are increasing. Many students work at petrol pumps, markets, selling SIM cards etc after graduation. You might have observed this. All in all, students studying in Zimbabwe have informed us they have to meet an expense of about $3000 or more per annum.
254 - 06 Feb 2024 12:50PM - Pallika Edoofa: At the same time, Edoofians are studying here in India at a cost much less than that of Zimbabwe and even self-sponsoring their education through the Earn While You Learn Program. We also ensure they develop employability skills so that they are job-ready by the time they graduate. I believe you are looking forward to such an opportunity for your career, aren't you?

They will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. will be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by paying the registration fee within a few weeks.  This registration fee($500-$1000) isn‚Äôt an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year‚Äôs Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education and the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).

Ensure to include these aspects during the discussions:-  *About the EDOOFA Program and its vision of making Education Affordable and Edoofians Employment Ready.* *Value of the career of an Edoofian after pursuing higher education in India.* *The financial aspects and how Edoofa brings in affordability and self-financing opportunities for students.*

Let me also share a few pictures of the students who are studying in India through the Edoofa Program so that you can witness the exposures and their experiences.

179 - 05 Feb 2024 03:23PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Not to worry, Prosper! Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth properly.  In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around $6000-$8000 per year. Now this is very low as compared to other Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc. It is still beyond the reach of many. So with the Edoofa Scholarship Program the cost trips down to $2000-$3000 for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying in the Eligibility check Process. This cost includes: 1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any) 2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Gym, Laundry, etc.) 3. Food 4. Accommodation
