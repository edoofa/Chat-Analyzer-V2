05/02/24, 11:19 am - +263 78 089 5474: We shall continue
05/02/24, 11:19 am - Keshav Edoofa: No worries , i shall brief you about Edoofa in depth!
05/02/24, 11:20 am - Keshav Edoofa: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
05/02/24, 11:20 am - Keshav Edoofa: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
05/02/24, 11:20 am - Keshav Edoofa: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
05/02/24, 11:20 am - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>
05/02/24, 11:26 am - +263 78 089 5474: Thank you
05/02/24, 11:27 am - +263 78 089 5474: So who are eligible for 100% scholarship
05/02/24, 11:54 am - Keshav Edoofa: I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.
05/02/24, 11:54 am - Keshav Edoofa: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
05/02/24, 2:37 pm - +263 78 089 5474: Olk noted thankx
05/02/24, 2:37 pm - +263 78 089 5474: Thats it sure
05/02/24, 2:41 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Alright so Kuzivakwashe, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.

I would like to know you better as a student, so please go ahead, and tell me a bit about yourself, your education, what you wish to study, your strengths, your weaknesses, your hobbies, and a detailed description of your family background, *Where do your parents work (Place) in your country or any other country that they have relocated to due to work promises?  Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work) since I honestly don't know a lot about you?*
05/02/24, 2:59 pm - +263 78 089 5474: Ohh olk 
So am Kuzivakwashe Nyevera a boy aged 20 . I did my O n A level studies at First Choice Pvt school. I wish to study social work .My mother is a teacher while my father is a carpenter and we live in Zimbabwe
05/02/24, 3:01 pm - +263 78 089 5474: I like to play foatball n volleyball and l like to be a lead
05/02/24, 3:06 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Thank you for the introduction Kuzivakwashe
05/02/24, 3:06 pm - Keshav Edoofa: May I know who has supported your tertiary education till now and who is going to support you financially with your higher education abroad?
05/02/24, 3:15 pm - +263 78 089 5474: The reason why l applied for this scholarship is that financially we are not stable financially
05/02/24, 3:15 pm - +263 78 089 5474: Yu are welcome
05/02/24, 3:16 pm - +263 78 089 5474: My parents can manage some expenses
05/02/24, 3:17 pm - Keshav Edoofa: May I know what is your term fee at First Choice Pvt school?
05/02/24, 3:18 pm - +263 78 089 5474: US$300 .00
05/02/24, 3:19 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Meanwhile as we proceed ahead, I had a question, during your introduction you mentioned you would like to study Social Work, could you please share what motivates you behind this field of study?
05/02/24, 3:24 pm - +263 78 089 5474: The living standards of a number of people who did social work motivates me
05/02/24, 3:26 pm - Keshav Edoofa: You see Kuzivakwashe, being in the education field the concern is that Social Work is a niche course and not many universities don't teach this course as the cost of education of this course from a university point of view is too high as they have to invest a lot of money as it is practical in nature and not theoretical.

Now usually what students do is they pursue a course which similar to social work as when we come to job market many people compete for the same position just because they have relevant knowledge of the same course that they studying, without pursuing a degree in social work 

Thus what students usually do is pursue course in Sociology in the first place because both the courses are similar in nature, that is why students who pursue Sociology have career opportunities that are present for social work already and further extra opportunities await.

So in that case shall I brief you about B.A. (Hons.) in Sociology?
05/02/24, 3:31 pm - +263 78 089 5474: Thank you so much for the information
05/02/24, 3:32 pm - +263 78 089 5474: Ohh olk you can buh l have a passion in social work
05/02/24, 3:33 pm - Keshav Edoofa: You see both fields are very closely related and you can get involved in social work through specialization courses, workshops, drives, etc while pursuing Sociology!
05/02/24, 3:41 pm - +263 78 089 5474: Ohhh olk 
Do you have social work ?
05/02/24, 3:42 pm - +263 78 089 5474: Can l get more information about sociology
05/02/24, 3:47 pm - Keshav Edoofa: As i explained, Kuzivakwashe a very few universities offer social work as a degree because of the reasons I cited and they do not offer any scholarships as well,
05/02/24, 3:47 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Sure
05/02/24, 3:47 pm - Keshav Edoofa: *B.A. (Hons.) in Sociology* is an undergraduate program that deals with various aspects of social behavior and its consequence on modern society.
