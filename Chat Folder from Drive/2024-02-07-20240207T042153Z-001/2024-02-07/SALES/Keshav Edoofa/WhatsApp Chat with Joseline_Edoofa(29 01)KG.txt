it gives an.opportunity to expand your.networks and skills also and to learn.culture in.other countries ..

thank you sir
29/01/24, 12:36 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I will explain you further about the program!
29/01/24, 12:36 pm - Keshav Edoofa: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
29/01/24, 12:36 pm - Keshav Edoofa: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
29/01/24, 12:37 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
29/01/24, 12:38 pm - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/01/24, 12:48 pm - +263 71 742 6902: thank you now l understand better
29/01/24, 12:48 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
29/01/24, 12:53 pm - +263 71 742 6902: yes it is
29/01/24, 12:54 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Okay so Joseline, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
29/01/24, 2:37 pm - +263 71 742 6902: yes l do.have
29/01/24, 2:40 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Alright so Joseline, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.

I would like to know you better as a student, so please go ahead, and tell me a bit about yourself, your education, what you wish to study, your strengths, your weaknesses, your hobbies, and a detailed description of your family background, *Where do your parents work (Place) in your country or any other country that they have relocated to due to work promises?  Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work) since I honestly don't know a lot about you?*
29/01/24, 2:53 pm - +263 71 742 6902: thanks for the opportunity ..

29/01/24, 3:01 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I really appreciate how sincere you were in expressing yourself, Joseline. I have confidence that you are an exceptionally diligent student, and you will undoubtedly demonstrate your capabilities if given the right guidance!
29/01/24, 3:01 pm - Keshav Edoofa: May I know who has supported your tertiary education till now and who is going to support you financially with your higher education abroad?
29/01/24, 3:13 pm - +263 71 742 6902: my parents are the ones who supported my education.and by chance l.was once a BEAM. beneficiary at high school
29/01/24, 3:14 pm - +263 71 742 6902: thank.you sir
29/01/24, 3:15 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Are they willing to support you for your higher education abroad?
29/01/24, 3:16 pm - +263 71 742 6902: lm.stuck.in.the middle of nowhere .thats why lm.looking for a scholarship to help my parents the burden.of funding my tertiary education since l.know they will.not afford
29/01/24, 3:16 pm - +263 71 742 6902: they are willing but its unfortunate they can.not afford
29/01/24, 3:23 pm - Keshav Edoofa: let me explain to you that there are two kinds of programs that provide assistance to the students because a lot of times parents and students themselves misunderstand what a Scholarship actually means.

*1. Scholarships*
*2. Sponsorships*

Scholarships make education *affordable* for the students by reducing their *Tuition Fees*, now a lot of times parents and students consider that a Domestic Scholarship would be the same as an International Scholarship, but to understand the difference between them, consider yourself applying for an education in your own country with the help of a scholarship. Now after the scholarship when your tuition fee would be reduced, eventually your entire cost of education would be reduced because being a citizen of the country, you wouldn't be required to spend any fees on Accommodation and feeding separately since in that case, students would be staying with their families. However, if I personally plan to study in Zimbabwe with the same scholarship, I would have to incur some costs on Accommodation and Feeding because I am not a Zimbabwean Citizen. So a lot of times parents and students consider International Scholarship and Domestic Scholarship one and the same thing, but in reality, they aren't.

Sponsorships, on the other hand, take care entirely of a student's education, but because Sponsorships are provided by only a few organizations, there are a lot of terms and conditions which a student might need to follow in order to get the sponsorship, the most common term is that a student after completion of the course would have to work for the organization providing the sponsorship for a period of time.
29/01/24, 3:23 pm - Keshav Edoofa: We at Edoofa provide scholarship to students and not sponsorships
29/01/24, 3:32 pm - +263 71 742 6902: olk so.this implies that there are certain.things we.pay for ourselves
29/01/24, 3:32 pm - +263 71 742 6902: like accomodation fee etc
29/01/24, 3:37 pm - Keshav Edoofa: see I will explain with to you with an example, Avg cost of education in India is 7-8000$ which is very low in comparison to other countries like US and UK where the cost ranges from 25,000-30000$ , thus after the Edoofa scholarship program that is after the scholarship you receive the fee comes down to 2-3000$ per annum which includes tuition fee , accommodation university expense, and food!
29/01/24, 4:43 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Well Joseline, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you *tomorrow again at 9:30 AM CAT* to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care and do watch the video I am sharing below.
