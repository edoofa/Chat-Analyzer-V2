05/02/24, 11:43 am - Keshav Edoofa: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
05/02/24, 11:43 am - Keshav Edoofa: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
05/02/24, 11:43 am - Keshav Edoofa: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already.

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.
05/02/24, 2:07 pm - +27 68 748 8308: Oky got it.. My parents are with me throughout

06/02/24, 10:34 am - Keshav Edoofa: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
06/02/24, 10:39 am - +27 68 748 8308: I want to study abroad because I have seen many graduates sitting with their certificates unemployed in my country meaning low chances of getting employed also it's good to see the outside get to learn new things meet new people that give new ideas
06/02/24, 10:40 am - Keshav Edoofa: Since you are aware that through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.
I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination?
06/02/24, 10:45 am - +27 68 748 8308: Yes I been wondering that
06/02/24, 10:47 am - Keshav Edoofa: You see Edoofa’s vision to provide every student with an education that is not just affordable but accessible and employable as well can only be achieved by utilizing the infrastructure of Indian Education landscape that has been developed over the last 75+ years since India’s Independence.

06/02/24, 11:01 am - +27 68 748 8308: Oky I get it thank you
06/02/24, 11:04 am - Keshav Edoofa: In that case let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
06/02/24, 11:04 am - Keshav Edoofa: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
06/02/24, 11:04 am - Keshav Edoofa: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
06/02/24, 11:04 am - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>
06/02/24, 11:04 am - Keshav Edoofa: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
06/02/24, 11:08 am - +27 68 748 8308: So you can be part of the earn while you Learn Programme at your first semester?
06/02/24, 11:13 am - +27 68 748 8308: How does becoming part of the Earn While you Learn Programme further reduce the cost
06/02/24, 11:16 am - Keshav Edoofa: In simple words Luyanda what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well. 

However as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her counselling, eligibility check stage and is thorough throughout the evaluation, then they surely are rewarded with higher quantum of scholarship after which the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, now this , and even *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
06/02/24, 11:17 am - +27 68 748 8308: Oh oky I get it. I understand
06/02/24, 11:19 am - Keshav Edoofa: So now shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?
06/02/24, 11:19 am - +27 68 748 8308: Yes I would like that
06/02/24, 11:20 am - Keshav Edoofa: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in
06/02/24, 11:20 am - Keshav Edoofa: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

*1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

06/02/24, 11:20 am - Keshav Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase. 

*What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
06/02/24, 11:30 am - +27 68 748 8308: The Programme is the good one because I also think experimenting gives much knowhow and experience. The Earn While You Learn Programe will greatly benefit me as I will be already practicing in the field before graduating so this will increase the knowledge and experince
06/02/24, 11:31 am - Keshav Edoofa: I am delighted to hear that Luyanda, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
06/02/24, 11:33 am - +27 68 748 8308: Oky i am getting it correct
06/02/24, 11:33 am - Keshav Edoofa: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

06/02/24, 11:33 am - Keshav Edoofa: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
06/02/24, 11:37 am - +27 68 748 8308: This is great. Definitely something I would love
06/02/24, 11:38 am - +27 68 748 8308: And this is what I am looking for. And I see the difference
06/02/24, 11:38 am - Keshav Edoofa: I am glad to hear that!
06/02/24, 11:38 am - +27 68 748 8308: Thank you
06/02/24, 11:38 am - Keshav Edoofa: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
06/02/24, 11:39 am - +27 68 748 8308: Yes um ready
06/02/24, 11:42 am - Keshav Edoofa: Luyanda as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
06/02/24, 11:44 am - +27 68 748 8308: It can amount upto 1500 if it's 300 per application
06/02/24, 11:45 am - +27 68 748 8308: 2250 if it's 450 per university
06/02/24, 11:46 am - Keshav Edoofa: Exactly Luyanda, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
06/02/24, 11:46 am - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>
06/02/24, 11:46 am - Keshav Edoofa: *But, as we know the COVID-19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
06/02/24, 11:47 am - +27 68 748 8308: Oky I get that makes it better
06/02/24, 11:48 am - Keshav Edoofa: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university zapplications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
06/02/24, 11:50 am - +27 68 748 8308: SOPs?
06/02/24, 11:51 am - Keshav Edoofa: statement of purpose Luyanda
06/02/24, 11:51 am - +27 68 748 8308: Yes it is
06/02/24, 11:51 am - +27 68 748 8308: Oh oky get that
06/02/24, 11:52 am - Keshav Edoofa: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
06/02/24, 11:53 am - +27 68 748 8308: Oky go ahead
06/02/24, 11:53 am - Keshav Edoofa: You see Edoofa's exceptional program has opened up a world of opportunities for aspiring students, garnering thousands of applications on a daily basis. The Eligibility Evaluation process ensures that deserving candidates are granted the chance to participate in the program. *Once accepted, students are requested to pay a nominal Program Fee of $350 within 7 days of receiving their acceptance letter*, following which they commence with their admission process and the esteemed Earn While You Learn Program. Edoofa's mission to provide quality education and support to students is at the heart of this initiative, and we are honored to make a difference in the lives of deserving individuals through this program.
06/02/24, 11:53 am - Keshav Edoofa: However luyanda, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.* <This message was edited>
06/02/24, 11:55 am - +27 68 748 8308: Alright. Noted and well understood I think thus fair and better
06/02/24, 11:56 am - Keshav Edoofa: From your response I can see you did understand the financial aspect of the Edoofa Program quite well Luyanda, however I hope that you have understood how it totally depends upon the student to make his/her higher education affordable with the help of the Earn While You Learn Program's Scholarship Credits?
06/02/24, 11:56 am - +27 68 748 8308: Thus all clear to me thanks to you
06/02/24, 12:00 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Now, before I brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle i want you to share you to share the A and O level results with me?!
06/02/24, 12:01 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Kindly share in the document or picture format

06/02/24, 12:03 pm - +27 68 748 8308: For now I have these
06/02/24, 12:03 pm - +27 68 748 8308: My mother send them when she gets online
06/02/24, 12:03 pm - Keshav Edoofa: And the O level results?

06/02/24, 12:13 pm - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>
06/02/24, 12:13 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Alright Luyanda, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zimbabwe itself.
06/02/24, 12:14 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
06/02/24, 12:14 pm - +27 68 748 8308: Oky thank you n sorry for the delay
06/02/24, 12:16 pm - +27 68 748 8308: All steps are clear and understandable
06/02/24, 12:16 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of the registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you
06/02/24, 12:16 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Basically, this registration fee will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August/September 2024 and the remaining in January next year 2025.
06/02/24, 12:17 pm - Keshav Edoofa: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
06/02/24, 12:17 pm - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>
06/02/24, 12:18 pm - +27 68 748 8308: Oky I get it
06/02/24, 12:20 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Okay so with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check, I want to ask if is there anything you would like me to address @27687488308 @263774408361 
I hope you are keeping a follow-up on your child's counseling session!?
06/02/24, 12:29 pm - +27 68 748 8308: Yes we got everything
06/02/24, 12:30 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed?
