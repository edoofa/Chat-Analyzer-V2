In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

MSW, also termed as Masters of Social Work is a 2 year undergraduate degree course that provides knowledge and skills to work in the social sector, aiming to provide quality life as well as education. Social Work, as the name suggests, aims to provide each and every citizen, specifically the less priviledged ones, a dignified life worth living with all aspects of social amenities and equal justice.

*What is MSW Course*
MSW is a three-year undergraduate professional degree course majoring in the field of social work. A typical MSW degree course lasts three years and is broken down into six semesters.  In certain circumstances, candidates are required to finish the program within a maximum of six years. Candidates can enroll in MSW full-time or even as a correspondence or distance learning degree. There are three main components to the MSW course: the foundation course, the elective course, and the fieldwork.

MSW courses can be pursued in various colleges in the country. It is useful to candidates who may like to work in social welfare sectors as it helps them acquire professional skills and knowledge to help the clients deal with their emotional and psychological problems. The curriculum provides social work education and training based on indigenous knowledge. It helps the learner to develop the required attitudes in understanding people’s problem-solving interventions.

*Why Study MSW*
MSW is apt for candidates interested in providing professional assistance to people in need. 

-MSW is specially meant for the ones who are aiming at improving the quality of life of the poorest of the poor and understand the growing demand for professionally trained social workers across the country.
-MSW helps the learner acquire professional skills and develop the capacity in helping people to solve various social and economic problems. 
-Having good observation and evaluation skills along with some prior knowledge of prevailing social issues helps in gaining excellence in the subject.
