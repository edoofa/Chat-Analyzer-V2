30/01/24, 11:24 am - Keshav Edoofa: Excellent Shawn, but let me further add to it <This message was edited>
30/01/24, 11:24 am - Keshav Edoofa: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
30/01/24, 11:24 am - Keshav Edoofa: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
30/01/24, 11:24 am - Keshav Edoofa: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
30/01/24, 11:24 am - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>
30/01/24, 11:24 am - Keshav Edoofa: It is with great pride that i would like to share with you that, recently we hosted a special conference for our Edoofians studying in India,  *SLICE - CON'24 - Symposium of Leaders, Innovators and Creators with Edoofa*, The students embarked on an enlightening industrial visit, immersing themselves in dynamic interactions with our esteemed Founders, CEOs, and visionary entrepreneurs. This is one of the many benefits of the Edoofa Scholarship Program and have a look at the glimpses of this auspicious 3 day event.
30/01/24, 11:45 am - +263 77 412 1368: That is great and good to know you really are assisting a lot of students
30/01/24, 11:47 am - Keshav Edoofa: I feel you too Shawn are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
30/01/24, 12:08 pm - +263 77 412 1368: So how do you rate which student to give scholarship and at such at percentage
30/01/24, 12:09 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Also it depends upon your grades, your willingness to join the program to achieve greater things in life etc.
30/01/24, 12:13 pm - +263 77 594 9676: Yes that is right
30/01/24, 12:16 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Alright so Shawn, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.

I would like to know you better as a student, so please go ahead, and tell me a bit about yourself, your education, what you wish to study, your strengths, your weaknesses, your hobbies, and a detailed description of your family background, *Where do your parents work (Place) in your country or any other country that they have relocated to due to work promises?  Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work) since I honestly don't know a lot about you?*

My hobbies are playing sports such as soccer, basketball, athletics and sometimes dabble in chess, I do sometimes look for advancements in the technical world.

I am the first born of 2 children, with a younger brother aged 12. Both my parents are still alive and well. I grew up in a small town called Redcliff and we moved here to Harare in 2015.
My father works at a company called CAFCA where he is a Fitter and Turner and my mother works at a company called ZETDC where she is a secretary. They both work here in Harare.

31/01/24, 10:24 am - +263 77 594 9676: Our country hasn’t fully developed yet and due to overpopulation there are very few job opportunities. Studying outside will be a refreshing experience and the greatest benefit is it’ll be easier to venture out into other countries be it for work purposes or just site seeing.

Upon graduation is it possible to get a full time job in India
31/01/24, 11:14 am - Keshav Edoofa: Exactly Shawn, We at Edoofa stand with the students throughout their journey
31/01/24, 11:14 am - Keshav Edoofa: Now shall we proceed ahead?
31/01/24, 11:14 am - +263 77 594 9676: Yes please
31/01/24, 11:16 am - Keshav Edoofa: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
31/01/24, 11:16 am - Keshav Edoofa: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
31/01/24, 11:16 am - Keshav Edoofa: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
31/01/24, 11:17 am - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>
31/01/24, 11:17 am - Keshav Edoofa: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
31/01/24, 11:23 am - +263 77 412 1368: Morning, so basically you mean if he gets sponsorship we would have to pay something between $2000 to $3000 per year
31/01/24, 11:25 am - Keshav Edoofa: In simple words Shawn what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
31/01/24, 11:26 am - +263 77 412 1368: So we would also have to cater for the tickets and visa process
31/01/24, 11:30 am - Keshav Edoofa: Right Mrs. Moilela, the student is given scholarship on the Tuition, food, and accommodation but the student has to bear the cost of the Visa and ticket separately but i would like to next brief you about the Earn while you Learn program that is the biggest benefit we provide to students during their journey with us
31/01/24, 11:30 am - Keshav Edoofa: Shall i proceed?

31/01/24, 11:36 am - Keshav Edoofa: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in
31/01/24, 11:36 am - Keshav Edoofa: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

*1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

31/01/24, 11:36 am - Keshav Edoofa: *2. Recruitment Partners: -*

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
31/01/24, 11:36 am - Keshav Edoofa: *3. Webinars: -*

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -

31/01/24, 11:37 am - Keshav Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase. 

*What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit Shawn?*
31/01/24, 11:49 am - +263 77 412 1368: I think this will be a huge and great benefit for Shawn because he would get an opportunity of all the resources and exposure to rise and shine in his line of education and work
31/01/24, 11:51 am - Keshav Edoofa: I am delighted to hear that Mrs. Moilela, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
31/01/24, 11:54 am - +263 77 594 9676: So it’s possible to work so much as to pay my full tuition with the EWYL program
31/01/24, 11:57 am - Keshav Edoofa: Definitely Shawn that is why our EWYL program is one of its kind
31/01/24, 11:57 am - Keshav Edoofa: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.
31/01/24, 11:57 am - +263 77 412 1368: Will the time they work not clash with their learning time

31/01/24, 11:58 am - Keshav Edoofa: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
31/01/24, 11:59 am - Keshav Edoofa: Absolutely not Mrs. Moilela because the EWYL program is designed as such that student studies doesn't get hampered while working in EWYL
31/01/24, 12:01 pm - +263 77 594 9676: That endeed is what we’ve been looking for
31/01/24, 12:02 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I am delighted to hear that
31/01/24, 12:03 pm - +263 77 412 1368: So this is really a great opportunity for all the kids you assist and they get a chance to have more experience
31/01/24, 12:47 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Exactly Mrs. Moilela, i am glad you could resonate with benefits of our program
31/01/24, 12:48 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
31/01/24, 12:48 pm - Keshav Edoofa: @263774121368 @263775949676
31/01/24, 2:34 pm - +263 77 594 9676: Hi
Sorry for taking long to respond, my mom has a meeting at work
31/01/24, 2:38 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Its Alright shall we continue in that case?
31/01/24, 2:40 pm - +263 77 594 9676: We may continue
31/01/24, 2:50 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Shawn as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
31/01/24, 2:52 pm - +263 77 594 9676: They’d end up spending a range of of $1500-$2250
31/01/24, 2:53 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Exactly Shawn, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
31/01/24, 2:53 pm - +263 77 594 9676: So this is a once off payment?
31/01/24, 2:54 pm - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>
31/01/24, 2:54 pm - Keshav Edoofa: *But, as we know the COVID-19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
31/01/24, 2:56 pm - +263 77 594 9676: This is only for students partaking in round 6?
31/01/24, 2:58 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Can you please elaborate on that Shawn what you are trying ask?
31/01/24, 2:59 pm - +263 77 594 9676: I’m saying round 6 in terms of this.
Isn’t it you pick a date and the fee is determined by the date you’ve chosen
31/01/24, 3:01 pm - Keshav Edoofa: See Shawn the enrollment fee will only be 350$ if you clear the eligibility check and pay the fee before 29th of February and it will be back to 750$ after February
31/01/24, 3:02 pm - +263 77 594 9676: Oh oky
31/01/24, 3:04 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I hope you got a better clarity?
31/01/24, 3:04 pm - +263 77 594 9676: Yes I did
31/01/24, 3:38 pm - +263 77 412 1368: Hi sorry was in a meeting, I just wanted clarification on the enrollment fees stated here $350 is for enrolment to Edoofa as agents or paid to university
31/01/24, 3:40 pm - +263 77 412 1368: Can you also clarify on the eligibility check, who or what determines your eligibility
01/02/24, 2:46 pm - +263 77 594 9676: Good afternoon
02/02/24, 8:47 am - Keshav Edoofa: Good Morning, Hope you are doing well
Sorry for the delayed response , i had some challenges with my device 
So shall we continue with your session?
02/02/24, 8:48 am - +263 77 594 9676: Morning, how are you?
02/02/24, 8:48 am - +263 77 594 9676: Yes we may proceed
02/02/24, 8:50 am - Keshav Edoofa: I am well Shawn
02/02/24, 8:57 am - Keshav Edoofa: See Mrs. Moilela I would like to brief you first that we are not any agents, we are an organization that helps students not only till the admission to prestigious universities here in India but rather stands along with the students helping them with guidance and providing them with all kinds of support throughout their stay in India and till they complete their studies and even post that.

Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university zapplications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
02/02/24, 9:04 am - +263 77 412 1368: Morning, well this really good you are doing a great job then with helping out all those children you assist. I must say even your counselling sessions have given Shawn and us as well a broad view of all the possibility that Shawn can have with choosing Civil Engineering, you explained everything quite clear. 

Thank you so much👏👏
02/02/24, 9:05 am - Keshav Edoofa: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
02/02/24, 9:06 am - Keshav Edoofa: You see Edoofa's exceptional program has opened up a world of opportunities for aspiring students, garnering thousands of applications on a daily basis. The Eligibility Evaluation process ensures that deserving candidates are granted the chance to participate in the program. *Once accepted, students are requested to pay a nominal Program Fee of $350 within 7 days of receiving their acceptance letter*, following which they commence with their admission process and the esteemed Earn While You Learn Program. Edoofa's mission to provide quality education and support to students is at the heart of this initiative, and we are honored to make a difference in the lives of deserving individuals through this program.
02/02/24, 9:06 am - Keshav Edoofa: However Shawn and Mrs. Moilela, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
02/02/24, 9:14 am - +263 77 412 1368: Well I  already like your program and wait for your response if Shawn is eligible and make the payment.
02/02/24, 9:15 am - Keshav Edoofa: From your response I can see you did understand the financial aspect of the Edoofa Program quite well Mrs. Moilela, however I hope that you and Shawn have understood how it totally depends upon the student to make his/her higher education affordable with the help of the Earn While You Learn Program's Scholarship Credits?
02/02/24, 9:15 am - +263 77 594 9676: Yes we have understood that
02/02/24, 9:16 am - +263 77 594 9676: And I am willing to put a lot of effort
02/02/24, 9:16 am - +263 77 412 1368: We understood very well and I will encourage him all the way during the course of time
02/02/24, 10:22 am - Keshav Edoofa: That is great to hear from you both, amazing!
02/02/24, 10:23 am - Keshav Edoofa: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.
02/02/24, 10:23 am - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>
02/02/24, 10:23 am - Keshav Edoofa: Alright Shawn, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zimbabwe itself.
02/02/24, 10:24 am - Keshav Edoofa: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
02/02/24, 10:31 am - +263 77 594 9676: Yes I have
02/02/24, 10:31 am - Keshav Edoofa: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of the registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
02/02/24, 10:32 am - Keshav Edoofa: Basically, this registration fee will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August/September 2024 and the remaining in January next year 2025.
02/02/24, 10:32 am - Keshav Edoofa: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
02/02/24, 10:32 am - Keshav Edoofa: Here is a picture of the Visa of one of the Edoofian who arrived in India, for 2023 Academic Intake.

02/02/24, 10:39 am - Keshav Edoofa: Would you like to ask anything more?
02/02/24, 10:39 am - Keshav Edoofa: Also @263774121368 i hope you are following up as well, is there anything you would like me to address?
02/02/24, 10:43 am - +263 77 412 1368: It all seems clear but, will you assist him with application forms for the University or he has to look for them on his own
02/02/24, 10:46 am - Keshav Edoofa: We will Assist and prepare all the application forms for multiple Universities Mrs. Moilela
02/02/24, 10:47 am - +263 77 412 1368: Noted, thank you
02/02/24, 10:47 am - Keshav Edoofa: Would you like to ask anything else?
02/02/24, 10:50 am - +263 77 412 1368: I think we can proceed
02/02/24, 10:57 am - Keshav Edoofa: Okay so with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check

05/02/24, 9:55 am - +263 77 412 1368: Then if a foreign child gets sick will you assist with medical bills or we would have to cater for it
05/02/24, 10:26 am - Keshav Edoofa: See Mrs. Moilela, Medical insurance is a vital part of being an international student. It is designed to provide financial protection in the event of serious illness or injury that may require medical care. Without medical insurance, international students may be responsible for the entire cost of medical care, which can be very expensive.

Medical insurance can also provide financial protection in the event of a medical emergency. This can include hospitalization, surgery, and other treatments that may be required for serious illnesses or injuries.

Medical insurance can also provide access to specialized medical care that may not be available in the student’s home country. This can include mental health services, reproductive health services, and other specialized care.

Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage.
If a person suddenly encounters any terrible danger, the change of nature one undergoes is equally great. Sometimes fear numbs our senses. Like animals, one stands still, powerless to move a step in fright or to lift a hand in defense of our lives, and sometimes one is seized with panic, and again, act more like the inferior animals than rational beings. On the other hand, frequently in cases of sudden extreme peril, which cannot be escaped by flight, and must be instantly faced, even the most timid men at once as if by miracle, become possessed of the necessary courage, sharp quick apprehension and swift decision. This is a miracle very common in nature. Man and the inferior animals alike, when confronted with almost certain death ‘ gather resolution from despair’ but there can really be no trace of so debilitating a feeling in the person fighting, or prepared to fight for dear life. At such times the mind is clearer than it has ever been; the nerves are steel, there is nothing felt but a wonderful strength and daring. Looking back at certain perilous moments in my own life, I remember them with a kind of joy, not that there was any joyful excitement then, but because they broadened my horizon, lifted me for a time above myself.

Whey to Go Greek yogurt—a strained form of cultured yogurt—has grown enormously in popularity in the United States since it was first introduced in the country in the late 1980s. From 2011 to 2012 alone, sales of Greek yogurt in the US increased by 50 percent. The resulting increase in Greek yogurt production has forced those involved in the business to address the detrimental effects that the yogurt-making process may be having on the environment. Fortunately, farmers and others in the Greek yogurt business have found many methods of controlling and eliminating most environmental threats. Given these solutions as well as the many health benefits of the food, the advantages of Greek yogurt Q5. outdo the potential drawbacks of its production.Sentence [1] The main environmental problem caused by the production of Greek yogurt is the creation of acid whey as a by-product.Sentence [2] Because it requires up to four times more milk to make than conventional yogurt does, Greek yogurt produces larger amounts of acid whey, which is difficult to dispose of.Sentence [3] To address the problem of disposal, farmers have found a number of uses for acid whey. Sentence[4] They can add it to livestock feed as a protein Q.6. supplement and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt. Sentence[5] If it is improperly introduced into the environment, acid-whey runoff Q.7. can pollute waterways, depleting the oxygen content of streams and rivers as it decomposes. Sentence [6] Yogurt manufacturers, food Q.8. scientists; and government officials are also working together to develop additional solutions for reusing whey.

Section 5

The Rwanda genocide took a tall on the natives. The number of deaths was unprecedented leaving countless widows, many orphaned children as well as mental instability amongst the people. Due to the rape cases done to the women, 16 years later the effects were still visible as the kids then were now the adults. Suck a sight is not something someone of a tender age as to witness as if it’s a normal thing. Effects of such activities resulted in women being ashamed of themselves as well as loss of hope and the ability to trust men. The mass murders affected Rwanda’s social and economical structures as the leading members were murdered hence leading to instability in power. Economical effects are that 16 years later food production was at a rate of plenty of food for lesser people but at the same time lack of man power meant that it wouldn’t always be the case. Such cases paved the way for unacceptable behaviors such as high level of corruption which is also other cause of economical instability. This also resulted in underdeveloped areas having to get worse as there was lack of resources even at basic operations hence starvation which can even be seen to this day. Another heartbreaking effect was the displacement of families which as a result had to lead to child headed families, depression amongst both adults and children and even to some extent suicide cases. Another result was end of bloodlines, end of lineages.

Section 6

Life is an unpredictable journey, filled with twists, turns, and unexpected challenges. My inspirational story is a testament to resilience, perseverance, and the transformative power of embracing adversity.
Growing up, I faced numerous obstacles that seemed insurmountable at the time. Raised in a modest environment, financial constraints were a constant companion. However, I was determined not to let circumstances define my future. Instead, I chose to see challenges as opportunities for growth.One of the pivotal moments in my life occurred during my high school years. Academic pressures, coupled with personal struggles, threatened to derail my dreams. In the face of adversity, I made a conscious decision to prioritize my education and develop a strong work ethic. Late nights were spent pouring over textbooks, and every setback was viewed as a lesson rather than a failure. <This message was edited>
05/02/24, 1:04 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Shawn While I get your test evaluated, I have your interview slots, however before I shared the interview slots I would like you and your parents as well to answer a few of my questions.

So I wanted to ask that for the same, so could you and your parent @263774121368 @263777345633 be online for the next 20 minutes to answer my question?
05/02/24, 1:05 pm - +263 77 594 9676: No problem
05/02/24, 1:06 pm - +263 77 412 1368: Noted, please go ahead
05/02/24, 1:07 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Mrs. Moilela, you see as per my experience over the last couple of years, I have been fortunate to have assisted over hundreds of students in achieving their career aspiration through the Edoofa Program. 

One of my key observations during helping out these students was regarding what was the common trait amongst students who are today having the best of their time in India through the Edoofa Program, and honestly I was able to come down to only one aspect that is FAMILY SUPPORT
05/02/24, 1:07 pm - Keshav Edoofa: You see in this journey of any child's higher education, there are three major contributors 

1. Student himself/herself
2. FAMILY
3. EDOOFA PROGAM

Now all the students who are today successfully a part of the Edoofa Program, had all these three contributors working together towards the common goal which is student's success and ensuring that by the time student completes his/her higher education they should be able to get good paying jobs. 

Even if any one of the contributor does not perform to the best of their abilities, Student's overall success is hampered. Let me give you a few examples

*In the event if student wishes to work hard, Edoofa is willing to support but the Family is not willing to support, the student will not be successful under the program*

*In the event if student wishes to work hard, Family is willing to support, but Edoofa's academic Board doesn't find the student worthy, the student will not be successful under the program*

*In the event if Family is willing to support, Edoofa's Academic Board is willing to support but the student doesn't wishes to work hard, then also the student will not be successful under the program*
05/02/24, 1:07 pm - Keshav Edoofa: During the evaluation of your child's application so far, the Academic Board has evaluated a few aspects, such as student's willingness to work hard, and family's willingness to support the student so that the student can achieve what he/she has aspired. However now in your interview ahead, the Academic Board would be strictly be evaluating the Family's support towards the child higher education. 

*As you know in the event if your child is found eligible, you would have to complete a certain part of the formalities within the 7 day timeline, so may I know regarding the same, are you willing to support your child to the fullest?*
05/02/24, 1:12 pm - +263 77 412 1368: Yes we are willing to support him to the fullest but my apologies on behalf of my husband he is not allowed to use the phone during working hours but will be free after 2pm as he will have finished work he is on shift work
05/02/24, 1:13 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Its Alright Mrs. Moilela i duly understand
05/02/24, 1:13 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Can you please acknowledge that using the voice notes please?
05/02/24, 1:14 pm - +263 77 412 1368: Yes it's quite ok we can go ahead
05/02/24, 1:18 pm - +263 77 412 1368: This message was deleted
05/02/24, 1:19 pm - +263 77 412 1368: <Media omitted>
05/02/24, 1:26 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
05/02/24, 1:26 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below
05/02/24, 1:26 pm - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>
05/02/24, 1:27 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I hope now you know Ideally, the tentative dates:

1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 12th or 13th of February 2024 for $200 and the 12th or 13th of March for the remaining $150.

2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 12th or 13th of February 2024

Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?
