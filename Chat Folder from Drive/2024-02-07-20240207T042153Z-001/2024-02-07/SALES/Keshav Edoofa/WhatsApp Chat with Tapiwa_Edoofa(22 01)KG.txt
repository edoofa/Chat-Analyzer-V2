22/01/24, 12:53 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Alright, so Tapiwa, I can see you got to know about the Edoofa Program from Shalom, is that correct?
22/01/24, 12:54 pm - +263 71 409 9999: Yes
22/01/24, 12:55 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Okay, so can you tell me what all did you learn about the Edoofa Program from Shalom, also do tell me whether you learnt about Shalom’s Journey and Experience with the Edoofa Program?
22/01/24, 1:02 pm - +263 71 409 9999: No l didn't learn about the shalom journey
22/01/24, 1:05 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Its Alright I will tell you about Edoofa scholarship program?
22/01/24, 1:06 pm - Keshav Edoofa: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
22/01/24, 1:06 pm - Keshav Edoofa: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
22/01/24, 1:06 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.

22/01/24, 1:09 pm - +263 71 409 9999: I learned
22/01/24, 1:13 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
22/01/24, 4:25 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Well , I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you *tomorrow again at 9:30 AM CAT* to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care and do watch the video I am sharing below.

Have a good day ahead. 
God Bless You!
22/01/24, 5:01 pm - +263 71 409 9999: Same to you
23/01/24, 9:29 am - Keshav Edoofa: Hello , Good Morning, Hope you are doing well

As discussed, I am here for us to continue with your application, so shall we start?
23/01/24, 10:01 am - +263 71 409 9999: Yes
23/01/24, 10:03 am - Keshav Edoofa: I hope you got familiar with the Edoofa scholarship program!
23/01/24, 10:06 am - +263 71 409 9999: Yeap
23/01/24, 10:10 am - Keshav Edoofa: Okay so Tapiwa, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
23/01/24, 10:11 am - +263 71 409 9999: Carry on
23/01/24, 10:14 am - Keshav Edoofa: Alright so Tapiwa, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.

25/01/24, 8:38 am - Keshav Edoofa: Hello Tapiwa , Good Morning, Hope you are doing well

As discussed, I am here for us to continue with your application, so shall we start?
25/01/24, 8:41 am - +263 71 409 9999: Yes
25/01/24, 8:46 am - Keshav Edoofa: Can you tell me about this Tapiwa?

25/01/24, 8:53 am - Keshav Edoofa: If you please shed some light on the financial planning your family has thought about regarding your higher education abroad?

25/01/24, 9:05 am - Keshav Edoofa: I understand that Tapiwa that is why motive was to check about the financial planning of your family , kindly tell me about the same , how is your family planning to financially support you?
25/01/24, 9:31 am - +263 71 409 9999: I can't give a clear shade on that because of our financial background
25/01/24, 9:37 am - Keshav Edoofa: let me explain to you that there are two kinds of programs that provide assistance to the students because a lot of times parents and students themselves misunderstand what a Scholarship actually means.

*1. Scholarships*
*2. Sponsorships*

Scholarships make education *affordable* for the students by reducing their *Tuition Fees*, now a lot of times parents and students consider that a Domestic Scholarship would be the same as an International Scholarship, but to understand the difference between them, consider yourself applying for an education in your own country with the help of a scholarship. Now after the scholarship when your tuition fee would be reduced, eventually your entire cost of education would be reduced because being a citizen of the country, you wouldn't be required to spend any fees on Accommodation and feeding separately since in that case, students would be staying with their families. However, if I personally plan to study in Zimbabwe with the same scholarship, I would have to incur some costs on Accommodation and Feeding because I am not a Zimbabwean Citizen. So a lot of times parents and students consider International Scholarship and Domestic Scholarship one and the same thing, but in reality, they aren't.

Sponsorships, on the other hand, take care entirely of a student's education, but because Sponsorships are provided by only a few organizations, there are a lot of terms and conditions which a student might need to follow in order to get the sponsorship, the most common term is that a student after completion of the course would have to work for the organization providing the sponsorship for a period of time.
25/01/24, 9:44 am - +263 71 409 9999: I understood it
25/01/24, 9:44 am - +263 71 409 9999: I want a 70%
25/01/24, 9:54 am - Keshav Edoofa: The scholarship is of minimum guaranteed 50% and ranges from 50-100% depending upon several factors like your grades, session responses and activeness, etc.
25/01/24, 10:00 am - +263 71 409 9999: I understood
25/01/24, 10:02 am - Keshav Edoofa: From your introduction i can see you want to study agriculture may I know what motivated you to pursue it?
25/01/24, 10:03 am - +263 71 409 9999: I wanted to be in aviation industry but l failed due to my susdiary pass in physics
25/01/24, 10:04 am - Keshav Edoofa: But here you mentioned about Agriculture right?
25/01/24, 10:08 am - +263 71 409 9999: Because l have any O in physics so my combination can't make up so l decide agric l
25/01/24, 10:16 am - Keshav Edoofa: Alright Tapiwa noted

25/01/24, 11:16 am - Keshav Edoofa: That is really great Tapiwa, I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations,

However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

Are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way inorder to transform your career dear?

25/01/24, 11:55 am - +263 71 409 9999: Abroad there are high chances of getting more tutorial and geography some times need an eye so studying abroad will help me on other lesson as in my country has no access to other activities
25/01/24, 11:56 am - +263 71 409 9999: There are no more practical activities in my country
25/01/24, 11:57 am - +263 71 409 9999: They are limited due to many factors
25/01/24, 12:00 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Before we proceed ahead with the session do kindly share your O and A level results with me for evaluation

25/01/24, 1:20 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

29/01/24, 11:52 am - +263 71 409 9999: Yes
29/01/24, 11:55 am - Keshav Edoofa: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
29/01/24, 11:55 am - Keshav Edoofa: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
29/01/24, 11:55 am - +263 71 409 9999: Okay
29/01/24, 11:55 am - Keshav Edoofa: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
29/01/24, 11:56 am - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/01/24, 11:56 am - Keshav Edoofa: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
30/01/24, 3:26 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Good afternoon Tapiwa shall we  continue with your session?

02/02/24, 10:42 am - Keshav Edoofa: In simple words Tapiwa let me summarize it for you, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
02/02/24, 10:53 am - +263 71 409 9999: How much will l earn
05/02/24, 10:08 am - Keshav Edoofa: Hello Tapiwa, Good Morning, Hope you are doing well
05/02/24, 10:14 am - +263 71 409 9999: Yea
05/02/24, 10:22 am - Keshav Edoofa: I will be informing you that as well Tapiwa once I briefly explain about the EWYL program, so shall I proceed ahead?
05/02/24, 10:28 am - +263 71 409 9999: Yes
05/02/24, 10:34 am - Keshav Edoofa: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in
05/02/24, 10:34 am - Keshav Edoofa: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

*1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-_*Africa Global Radio*_ - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

-_*Skooqs*_ - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
05/02/24, 10:34 am - Keshav Edoofa: *2. Recruitment Partners: -*

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
05/02/24, 10:34 am - Keshav Edoofa: *3. Webinars: -*

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
_Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world_ by *Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade*.

05/02/24, 10:34 am - Keshav Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase. 

*What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit Tapiwa?*
05/02/24, 4:25 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I was expecting your response, but it seems you are occupied at the moment, so I will have to schedule your session for *tomorrow at 9:30 AM CAT TIME* as my working hours are over for the day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning. 

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above-mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*

06/02/24, 10:07 am - Keshav Edoofa: Hello Tapiwa and Mrs. Nyasha @263714099999 @263788747134 , Good Morning, Hope you are doing well
06/02/24, 3:16 pm - +263 78 874 7134: I am fine
06/02/24, 3:17 pm - Keshav Edoofa: May I know if Tapiwa will be available now to continue the session?
06/02/24, 3:19 pm - +263 78 874 7134: He is not around bt when he comes back he will tell u
06/02/24, 3:20 pm - Keshav Edoofa: In that case, shall we continue with you Mrs. Nyasha?
06/02/24, 3:22 pm - +263 78 874 7134: OK lam her mother
06/02/24, 3:23 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Have you gone through these details? Mrs. Nyasha?
06/02/24, 3:25 pm - +263 78 874 7134: Yes
06/02/24, 3:26 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Do you think EWYL program will help Tapiwa in a great way?
06/02/24, 3:33 pm - +263 78 874 7134: Yes I am expecting that
06/02/24, 3:39 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I am delighted to hear that Mrs. Nyasha, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
06/02/24, 3:39 pm - Keshav Edoofa changed the group name from "Mushamba_Edoofa(22/01)KG" to "Tapiwa_Edoofa(22/01)KG"
06/02/24, 3:41 pm - +263 78 874 7134: Hook iam understanding
06/02/24, 3:43 pm - Keshav Edoofa: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

06/02/24, 3:43 pm - Keshav Edoofa: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
06/02/24, 4:20 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Well, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you *tomorrow again at 9:30 AM CAT* to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care.

Have a good day ahead. 
God Bless You!
