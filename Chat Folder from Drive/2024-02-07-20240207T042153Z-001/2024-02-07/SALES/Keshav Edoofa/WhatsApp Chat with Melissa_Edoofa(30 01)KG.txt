06/02/24, 10:32 am - +263 77 699 8697: Actually l got a link of Edoofa schoolaship group from my friend  when I was still an upper six student.
06/02/24, 10:32 am - +263 77 699 8697: When A level results came out , l had a conversation with Tinotenda and it was about this program. So she told me that this program offers social service which is educational service
06/02/24, 10:32 am - +263 77 699 8697: So it offers schoolaships  mostly to those who will be willing to proceed with education
06/02/24, 10:35 am - Keshav Edoofa: Amazing clarity Melissa
06/02/24, 10:36 am - Keshav Edoofa: Let me further elaborate about Edoofa scholarship program to you
06/02/24, 10:36 am - Keshav Edoofa: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
06/02/24, 10:36 am - Keshav Edoofa: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
06/02/24, 10:37 am - Keshav Edoofa: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.

06/02/24, 10:45 am - +263 77 699 8697: Ohh ok
06/02/24, 11:17 am - Keshav Edoofa: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
06/02/24, 11:29 am - +263 77 699 8697: Yeah u're right
06/02/24, 11:34 am - Keshav Edoofa: Okay so Melissa, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.
06/02/24, 11:35 am - +263 77 699 8697: Ohh ok
06/02/24, 11:43 am - Keshav Edoofa: Alright so Melissa, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.

I would like to know you better as a student, so please go ahead, and tell me a bit about yourself, your education, what you wish to study, your strengths, your weaknesses, your hobbies, and a detailed description of your family background, *Where do your parents work (Place) in your country or any other country that they have relocated to due to work promises?  Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work) since I honestly don't know a lot about you?*
06/02/24, 11:46 am - +263 77 699 8697: Ok
06/02/24, 11:50 am - +263 77 699 8697: So I'm a girl who sticks to her principles. I want to be a social lawyer that why l want to study law. When it comes to a hobby,  l enjoy reading novels
06/02/24, 11:52 am - +263 77 699 8697: My father is a carpenter and an electrician. My mother is a vendor
06/02/24, 11:55 am - +263 77 699 8697: My father work's at J . Wilson  in Norton, Zimbabwe
06/02/24, 1:35 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Thank you for your introduction Melissa
06/02/24, 1:35 pm - Keshav Edoofa: May I know who has supported your tertiary education till now and who is going to support you financially with your higher education abroad?
06/02/24, 4:27 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I was expecting your response, but it seems you are occupied at the moment, so I will have to schedule your session for *tomorrow at 9:30 AM CAT* as my working hours are over for the day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning. 

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above-mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
06/02/24, 5:51 pm - +263 77 699 8697: My father was supporting me but now he cannot afford the university fee
06/02/24, 5:52 pm - +263 77 699 8697: Ok
