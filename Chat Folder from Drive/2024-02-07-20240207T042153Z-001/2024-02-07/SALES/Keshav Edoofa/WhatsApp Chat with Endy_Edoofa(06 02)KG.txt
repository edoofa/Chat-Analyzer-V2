06/02/24, 1:51 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Good Morning Endy and Mrs. Lameck!

*I am Mr Keshav, Career Counsellor at Edoofa.*

We have received an application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program from Thrive.

I hope I have contacted the right person.

I would like you to come online so that I could discuss with you the form you submitted online and what I was able to understand from the same!
06/02/24, 4:27 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I was expecting your response, but it seems you are occupied at the moment, so I will have to schedule your session for *tomorrow at 9:30 AM CAT* as my working hours are over for the day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning. 

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above-mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
