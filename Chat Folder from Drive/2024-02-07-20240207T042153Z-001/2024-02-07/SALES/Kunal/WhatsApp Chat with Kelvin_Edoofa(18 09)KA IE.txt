I trust this message finds you in good health.

Having received your application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, I understand that you are seeking an opportunity not only to study abroad but also to build a career abroad through affordable, accessible, and employable education. However, over the last few days, it seems you haven't been able to respond, possibly due to reasons I am not aware of. This has led to an incomplete discussion regarding your scholarship application.

Often, we might have questions, queries, or doubts in our minds that we hesitate to share with others, assuming we might be judged or not understood properly. I want to assure you that at Edoofa, we are here to help you gain a comprehensive understanding of the entire process and address each and every doubt you may have.

In order to assist you in achieving an 80-100% scholarship, I am looking forward to a positive response from you soon.

Best regards,

Let me help you with the eligibility consideration for Malawi

1 = distinction, 2 = distinction, 3 = credit, 4 = credit, 5 = credit, 6 = credit, 7 = pass, 8 = pass, 9 = fail

Now,we accept upto 7=pass for a subject
Let us say a student has 5 subjects and scored 7 in all of them creating an aggregrate of 35,this would be the maxumum limit for eligibility.All students scoring an aggregate within this range would meet the academic requirement for the program
02/01/24, 1:28 pm - Kunal: The minimum requirement was higher pre pandemic but during the pandemic a lot of students failed to recieve enough resources and Educational support which we had shared with the Universities and Ministries due to which the requirements has been lowered but I always encourage my students to target for maximum to increase the chances of Higher Quantum of Scholarship!

I believe you are confident about meeting the requirements and perform well in MSCE!

03/01/24, 10:56 am - Kunal: Well, I am sure after seeing all these amazing facts, you are intrigued to study in India. So can you now tell me, How would studying in India implement a positive impact on your career and How do you aim to achieve your career aspirations from studying in India?
03/01/24, 11:13 am - +265 889 89 23 61: Now I have understood
03/01/24, 11:22 am - +265 889 89 23 61: It will help me to know better about life,to understood what is meant about life...
03/01/24, 11:25 am - Kunal: Amazing!
As I can see, you have understood the quality of higher education  which Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead.

By any chance are you familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship?
03/01/24, 11:33 am - +265 889 89 23 61: No
03/01/24, 11:59 am - Kunal: Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth! 

In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc,it is still beyond the reach of many.
With the Edoofa Scholarship Program,the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library,Wifi,Laundry,etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
03/01/24, 11:59 am - Kunal: <Media omitted>
03/01/24, 11:59 am - Kunal: In simple words what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well. 

However as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, simply after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.
03/01/24, 12:13 pm - +265 889 89 23 61: Thank you so much for your elaboration
03/01/24, 12:21 pm - +265 889 89 23 61: Now I have understand things, what should I do to become one of your students?
03/01/24, 12:40 pm - Kunal: Let me tell you that the student needs to clear the eligibility criteria in order to be found eligible for the program

The eligibility procedures are the criteria or set of evaluations that you need to get through in order to be eligible for the Edoofa Scholarship Program. They include-

-Final interview with Program Director(via whatsapp voice notes from a different interview group)
-Video interaction with your parents/parent

Your Academics, understanding of the program, willingness to be a part of the Edoofa family, personal traits, qualities, previous experiences, career aspirations, techchnical knowledge on the field opted etc would be evaluated!
03/01/24, 12:49 pm - +265 889 89 23 61: Alright...
Thanks alot
03/01/24, 12:53 pm - Kunal: Let me help you understand more

*Earn While You Learn Program*

The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
03/01/24, 12:53 pm - Kunal: Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.


The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
03/01/24, 12:53 pm - Kunal: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
03/01/24, 12:53 pm - Kunal: *Projects with Brands and Companies: -*
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:
Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4DAP24ZuY4&authuser=0
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0
Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
03/01/24, 12:53 pm - Kunal: *Recruitment Partners: -*
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics
03/01/24, 12:53 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
03/01/24, 12:53 pm - Kunal: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.


These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases.
03/01/24, 12:53 pm - Kunal: What are your views on the same? Do you think this will be benefiting from the Earn WHile You Learn Program?
03/01/24, 1:11 pm - +265 889 89 23 61: Yes of course...
03/01/24, 1:16 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
03/01/24, 1:16 pm - Kunal: Absolutely,
If I have to help you explain how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable compared to Local Universities, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now, if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, bringing the cost further down to $1000 per year including the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month. _This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly._

*You can see this even in this scholarship credit certificate where one of our star performers, our Proud Edoodians  Masinire Miriam earned $1965 within a year.* I hope you can now realize the power of the EWYL program to reduce the financial pressure on families?
03/01/24, 2:21 pm - Kunal: Shall we proceed?
03/01/24, 4:37 pm - +265 889 89 23 61: Yes you can
03/01/24, 4:49 pm - Kunal: Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counseling : 

 1. *Expert Career Counseling*: We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counselors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.
03/01/24, 4:49 pm - Kunal: 2. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off
03/01/24, 4:49 pm - Kunal: 3. *Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What's more, students earn
03/01/24, 4:49 pm - Kunal: *4.*Higher Education Concierge*: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education*.

After going through the facts that make Edoofa different.
Let me know which point out of 4 you like the most
03/01/24, 5:14 pm - Kunal: Are we connected?
03/01/24, 5:21 pm - +265 889 89 23 61: Sorry for replying late because I was busy with some duties
03/01/24, 5:22 pm - Kunal: I understand
03/01/24, 5:22 pm - Kunal: Please address this
03/01/24, 5:24 pm - +265 889 89 23 61: Wait I should read it...
03/01/24, 5:33 pm - +265 889 89 23 61: I would like to know most about EWYL...my question is,is it like e-learning which you learn while you're in your country or you be earning while you're still there?
03/01/24, 5:37 pm - +265 889 89 23 61: This is the one I like most
03/01/24, 5:43 pm - Kunal: Great! 
So now I know you focus more on quality education, services and guidance
Let me also show you some monthly earnings of students through Earn While You Learn.

03/01/24, 5:44 pm - Kunal: There is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it  depends upon his/her hard work.
However may I know, who will be helping you with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
03/01/24, 5:51 pm - +265 889 89 23 61: My mother
03/01/24, 5:52 pm - Kunal: That's completely understandable,
So, I believe you'll be discussing everything with them after we complete today's session. Also after our counseling session I would connect to some of our Beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know the proceedings well.

So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
03/01/24, 5:56 pm - +265 889 89 23 61: They feels good
03/01/24, 5:57 pm - Kunal: I am glad to hear that, as studying Internationally would make your career advance at even a greater pace, as you will be transformed to a professional with a Greater Paying Job, which would actually help you in uplifting your family thereby yourself, and provide a peaceful and hassle free life to your parents.
03/01/24, 5:57 pm - Kunal: *As we move to the last part of the session, let me highlight a few requirements while a student applies alone* 

*1) Application Form* -An online or offline form that asks for your personal details and academic background.

*2) Statement of Purpose-* An essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and your aspirations for your career.

*3) Letter of Recommendation-* from Senior authorities, School Heads or others on why they recommend you to be a right fit for an international university.
Do you know about other requirements?
03/01/24, 6:00 pm - +265 889 89 23 61: Tell me more...
03/01/24, 6:01 pm - Kunal: When a student applies alone for an international University, on average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose costs between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally and act as a major parameter to decide the child’s eligibility. If you apply to 5 Universities, the average costs for the mentioned would be $1350-$1750, *without even receiving a guarantee to be selected*
03/01/24, 6:01 pm - Kunal: *Edoofa has identified a solution for this uncertainty and unaffordability.* If a student qualifies after the eligibility check, not only does Edoofa help them draft their statement of purpose but also helps in terms of Visa Documentation Assistance, University Session and selection, Individual mentorship, etc, reducing the costs significantly to $750 which is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
03/01/24, 6:01 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
03/01/24, 6:22 pm - +265 889 89 23 61: Yes u can
03/01/24, 6:28 pm - Kunal: There are 3 phases to the enrollment process.
 
*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation
If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Acceptance Letter. You are supposed to pay the enrollment fee of $350 in 7 days for the scholarship seat reservation and to begin the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2*: Once the students complete Phase 1 they will be starting the Earn While You Learn program session(Each student will have an opportunity to earn scholarship credits that can be used to reduce their fee even before their MSCE result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final MSCEl results are out and the student has passed the requirement as per Edoofa, then their final university evaluation and Admission will continue. However, if the student wouldn’t meet the requirements as per the university and Edoofa, then the $350 will be refunded to the parent.

The amount of credits earned by the student in phase 2 can be used for the first year’s annual fee itself so that parents are relieved from financial stress paving the way for proper financial planning for higher education.
03/01/24, 6:28 pm - Kunal: The enrollment fee is to be paid only if a child is found eligible for the Edoofa Scholarship Program after passing the eligibility check stage, it includes, 

*Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
*Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
*Earn While You Learn Program and training*
*University sessions and selection*
*A guaranteed scholarship seat*
*Visa Documentation Assistance*
*The Foster and Care throughout the course of an Edoofian*
03/01/24, 6:28 pm - Kunal: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge due to which parents might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short period of 7 days and for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option wherein if the student is found eligible, instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, *parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days thereby reducing the financial pressure.*
03/01/24, 6:37 pm - Kunal: Shall we proceed?
03/01/24, 6:40 pm - +265 889 89 23 61: Yes u can
03/01/24, 6:41 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
03/01/24, 6:45 pm - +265 889 89 23 61: I think it's 2
03/01/24, 6:46 pm - Kunal: Well,
We are at stage one but we have also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.

In Step 1: Connect with a counsellor- As your counsellor, now we are going through the counselling process, discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

In Step 2:Eligibility Check- The eligibility check includes the interviews with Academic Board and Test.

Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa- If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program- This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.

We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
03/01/24, 6:49 pm - +265 889 89 23 61: Yes you can continue...
03/01/24, 6:49 pm - Kunal: Step 5: After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors , they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by making a payment of the registration fee within a few weeks.
03/01/24, 6:49 pm - Kunal: This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself and after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).
03/01/24, 6:49 pm - Kunal: Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment,you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.

I hope you are clear with the process.
03/01/24, 6:55 pm - Kunal: We have come to the end of your counselling session. Before I guide you Step 2 of the Eligibility Check, I want you to have a full-fledged discussion of the Edoofa program within your family as higher education is supposed to be a family decision. Ensure to include these aspects during the discussions:-
03/01/24, 6:55 pm - Kunal: *About the EDOOFA Program and its vision of making Education Affordable and Edoofians Employment Ready.*
*Value of the career of an Edoofian after pursuing higher education in India.*
*The financial aspects and how Edoofa brings in affordability and self-financing opportunities for students.*
03/01/24, 6:55 pm - Kunal: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences,

*Edoofa’s Website- www.edoofa.com* 
*Pictures (Edoofians from Africa studying in India): https://tinyurl.com/3ke35s35*
03/01/24, 6:55 pm - Kunal: *Please ensure to go through the FAQ document before the next stage and refer the same to your family as it has answers to most of the queries.* Furthermore, if you have any other queries I would suggest that you note them down and we will discuss them in the next session.

Let me also share a few pictures of the students who are studying in India through the Edoofa Program so that you can witness the exposures and their experiences.

Are you ready for the same?
04/01/24, 12:07 pm - +265 889 89 23 61: Yes I am
04/01/24, 12:08 pm - Kunal: It is good to connect with you today, Kelvin
I hope you are doing well
04/01/24, 12:08 pm - Kunal: Did you manage to discuss the Edoofa Program with your family, please?
04/01/24, 12:08 pm - +265 889 89 23 61: Yes am great thanks

Like some of them are
1.Travelling Documents processing,how does it go?
04/01/24, 12:30 pm - Kunal: As I mentioned earlier, Edoofa will be assisting you with the *Visa Documentation*
04/01/24, 12:31 pm - +265 889 89 23 61: And transportation fees
Is it from parents?
04/01/24, 12:51 pm - Kunal: If you understand the concept of International Education, the finances that play a major role is not visa fee or flight ticket because visa fee is given once in the whole program and the flight ticket is taken a limited number of times,maybe twice or once,because international students don't often travel back to their country.

They look forward to settling down and making sure education is not hampered.So they learn and do internships at breaks.But still students can definitely visit their family during holidays and spend time with them.

But I personally have seen that students don't travel often,so considering these the traveling fee is to be borne by the family which is mostly a one time investment.
04/01/24, 12:54 pm - +265 889 89 23 61: Alright noted...

22/01/24, 10:07 am - +265 889 89 23 61: Good morning to you the Head of Counseling at Edoofa, as I said last Friday that today we were suppose to do the transactions but unfortunately my parents have tried to do so,but up to date they have not afford to come up with that amount of money to pay since they work under government as I stipulated that she is a primary teacher so the payment are not yet.
22/01/24, 10:08 am - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: Good morning @265889892361
22/01/24, 10:13 am - +265 889 89 23 61: Good morning how are you doing?
22/01/24, 10:16 am - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: @265889892361 if I understand your parent's challenge clearly, as per what you shared, they haven't managed the entire enrollment fee as of now right?
22/01/24, 10:16 am - +265 889 89 23 61: Yes.
22/01/24, 10:17 am - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: Okay so if I may ask Kelvin, since your parents haven't shared their challenges clearly with us over here, may I know what part of the fee have they raised so far and how much more time do they need to prepare the rest of the fee please?
22/01/24, 10:54 am - +265 889 89 23 61: Sorry for replying late,I was on call with them to ask how much have they raised so far,so they said that they do not have any money as of now at least if you were to say month of February my be they can afford,in addition to that on fees that must be paid in a year which is $3000 they also said that they can't afford to so and comparing on how much do they get in a year this is very huge amount of money to them but with my sincere heart I was very willingly to study under Edoofa's program but because of my family's poverty they can't afford.
22/01/24, 11:04 am - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: @265889892361 did you read your letter of Acceptance clearly please?
22/01/24, 11:04 am - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: I think there is some misunderstanding because of which you are overcalculating a lot of things please!
22/01/24, 11:04 am - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: Who shared with you the Annual fee after scholarship to be $3000?
22/01/24, 11:05 am - +265 889 89 23 61: Yes I did
22/01/24, 11:05 am - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: What was your annual fee after scholarship please?
22/01/24, 11:12 am - +265 889 89 23 61: I thought the Program Director said that the range is $6000-$8000 so as for the program they pay half of it.
22/01/24, 11:14 am - +265 889 89 23 61: Now I have seen it, it's $1200-$1800
22/01/24, 11:16 am - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: Yes @265889892361, so now are you clear that your annual fee after scholarship is not $3000, it will between $1200-$1800?
22/01/24, 11:17 am - +265 889 89 23 61: Alright
22/01/24, 11:18 am - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: So now if I may ask @265889892361 wouldn't this be much more affordable for your family considering even if they would support you for your higher education even in Malawi they would end up spending more?
22/01/24, 11:32 am - +265 889 89 23 61: To say fact here in Malawi, the annual fee for higher education level is 600,000Malawi Kwacha which is almost $300 so as to compare there this is very huge amount of money as you said that it's $1200-$1800

22/01/24, 11:46 am - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: To be honest Kelvin I feel you are just beating around the bush without sharing the real concern or challenge that your family is facing. See dear if you want me to help you out in the best possible manner, I would appreciate if you can be honest and transparent in sharing your challenges, because as much as you wish to believe I am not some super human who would automatically get to know what challenges you are facing without your parents or you sharing with me what exactly is the challenge.
22/01/24, 12:15 pm - +265 889 89 23 61: Alright to be honest in our family their are number of challenges which we are facing,the first thing is that my Dad has now stopped working as a track driver due to some challenges the only person who is now working is my Mom so it is difficult for her to afford everything for the family and also I have another brother who is schooling here in Malawi is also looking after her as for fees and the like.
22/01/24, 12:15 pm - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: @265889892361 I personally feel apart from these concerns which you have shared, your family needs more clarity regarding Edoofa's legitimacy as well please!
22/01/24, 12:28 pm - +265 889 89 23 61: I wanted to ask her for a help since she does that for the needy people those that have passed and would like to study abroad.
22/01/24, 2:32 pm - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: @265889892361 I didn't get you?
22/01/24, 2:50 pm - +265 889 89 23 61: I wanted to ask her for a help.
22/01/24, 2:51 pm - +265 889 89 23 61: Am not getting you?
22/01/24, 3:03 pm - +265 889 89 23 61: She help the ones who would like to study abroad but because they can't manage in financial way she help in that manner.
22/01/24, 3:11 pm - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: Kelvin, now I understand.
22/01/24, 3:11 pm - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: At present what have you decided, may I know?
22/01/24, 4:14 pm - +265 889 89 23 61: To ignore me from the program since my parents they said that they will not afford😪
22/01/24, 4:14 pm - +265 889 89 23 61: Alright
22/01/24, 4:14 pm - +265 889 89 23 61: So you share the contact please.
22/01/24, 4:18 pm - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: @265889892361 let me update the same to the Academic Board please!

23/01/24, 8:05 pm - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: Sure @265880810993, Upon completing your formalities, in Step 5: we will initiate your Edoofa Admission Process and your Earn While You Learn Program. We will assign your complete application to our Admission Officers and the Head Coach of the Earn While You Learn Program.

The Admission Officers will be responsible for assisting you with all the required admission documentation that we discussed earlier, including the Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendation, and the completion of applications in all of Edoofa’s Associated Universities, etc.

The Head Coach will be responsible for assigning your application to the Earn While You Learn Program Mentor, who will then evaluate your candidature and assist with projects and assignments throughout your journey with the Edoofa Program.
23/01/24, 8:07 pm - +265 880 81 09 93: Got It
Kindly on Stage 6 please
23/01/24, 8:10 pm - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: As an organization that has positively impacted the lives of tens of thousands of African students, we understand that over 97% of parents face financial challenges when planning for their child’s tertiary education. In fact, it is one of the most prominent fears because of which there are parents who despite understanding the kind of growth their child would get through international education, still opt for their children to study in their home country.

Now in our quest to overcome this challenge, I would like to inform you that in Stage 5, while our Admission officers assist with all the necessary admission-related documentation, Edoofa’s Financial Planning team will connect with your parents to help them plan finances for your higher education.

Since in the majority of African nations inflation is a real challenge, keeping in mind that the cost of living in your home country increases atleast by 20% year on year, Financial Planning officers will be responsible for helping your parents plan for your tertiary education in a way that ensures they are not burdened financially throughout your education. Financial planning would include the following aspects:-
*Budgeting for your higher education, as per your parent's affordability.*
*Supporting your parents in building your tertiary education fund.*
23/01/24, 8:13 pm - +265 880 81 09 93: About traveling costs please!
