*Career Options in Sociology*
Sociology, as a career, is both impactful and fulfilling. Many of us have aspired to make an impact on society and the career options in sociology bring this opportunity close.

Here are some of the most popular career options in sociology:

1. Social Worker
A career in helping people and improving societies, which pretty much defines a social worker, is the most sought-after job for sociology aspirants. Sociology graduates can use the knowledge of social dynamics to analyse social issues and find ways to help resolve them. Social workers refer issues to appropriate community agencies to ensure the allotment of resources to individuals and families in need.

2. Journalist
For candidates with a flair of writing and a good grasp of observing mass attitude and analyse social issues, journalism is the ideal option. Top news agencies and publications in India are always on the lookout for professionals adept in understanding social circumstances.

3. Administrative Support
Top educational institutions require professionals who can assess individual and mass psychology, understand human behaviour and troubleshoot issues. Sociologists can become a part of the administrative staff at schools, colleges, and universities.

4. Rehabilitation Counsellor
If you are inclined towards helping the youths of their society, this career option is ideal for you. Rehabilitation counsellors use their counselling techniques learned in sociology to guide youths who have been misled into making wrong decisions in life, who have committed a crime and have completed their penitence, and those who have been abused or traumatised by life events.

5. Family Counsellor
Sociologists are adept counsellors, and that’s why their expertise can be utilised in family counselling. Family counsellors use their observation and critical thinking to assess different familial or marital issues and provide guidance in mitigation.

6. Survey Researcher
As the name suggests, survey researchers conduct surveys to make various decisions. These include observing patterns of social and political issues, health and culture, and how consumers are reacting to a particular product or service. They create questionnaires, form focus groups, and get clear answers. Sociologists make use of data collection and statistical analysis techniques to gather evidence and create well-informed reports for public and private organisations.

7. Human Resources (HR) Specialist
A part of being a sociologist includes interacting with a large number of people every day. This is the foundation of being an HR specialist who analyses job roles, decides if a candidate is suitable for a particular job, interviews the candidates to arrive at a decision.

8. Policy Analyst
Sociologists have to study policies in their academic journey. That’s why they are hired as policy analysts to observe social issues and recommend legislators to address these issues. Sociologists can make use of their knowledge and skill to analyse sociological research data to understand if particular legislation has made a positive or negative impact on social issues and population

9. Media Planner
A media planner’s job entails figuring out a plan to advertise for a product or service for a client. This requires a good grasp of mass psychology, and sociologists are taught exactly that. Top companies require experts to create market surveys, analyse data, and help marketers create advertising campaigns.

Moving ahead, by any chance are you familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?
31/01/24, 8:05 pm - +263 78 357 7548: Unfortunately not
31/01/24, 8:06 pm - Kunal: Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth! 

In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc,it is still beyond the reach of many.
With the Edoofa Scholarship Program,the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library,Wifi,Laundry,etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
31/01/24, 8:06 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
31/01/24, 8:07 pm - +263 78 357 7548: This is great
31/01/24, 8:09 pm - +263 78 357 7548: The scholarship will help me a great deal because without it I am not going to be able to fund it. But 3000 is affordable
31/01/24, 8:09 pm - +263 78 357 7548: I am confident that I can afford.
31/01/24, 8:10 pm - Kunal: Good to hear that
So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians.Looking at this cost of education also, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits and which can help you in reducing their fees further.
And do you know how that is done?
31/01/24, 8:10 pm - +263 78 357 7548: I promise to do my part as a parent to ensure that if he is selected, he will achieve his goals. I will support him in every way needed
31/01/24, 8:11 pm - +263 78 357 7548: Please enlighten me

31/01/24, 8:24 pm - Kunal: Let me tell you how Edoofa helps Edoofians bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the *Earn While You Learn Program*

The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that are equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable. The Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies and needs, converting an Individual into a market-ready professional. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
31/01/24, 8:24 pm - Kunal: *Projects with Brands and Companies: -*
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, such as:
*Africa Global Radio-* The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project and hear from the CEO about the exposures of the Edoofa program.

*Skooqs-* This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

*Recruitment Partners:-*
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

*Webinars:-*
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars regularly with the current leaders in the business field.

01/02/24, 9:48 am - Kunal: Good morning, everyone

*"Keep your face always toward the sunshine, and shadows will fall behind you."*

With a positive note, I am here to resume the session
Shall we proceed?
01/02/24, 9:53 am - +263 77 957 2874: Yes swe can...  I have managed to create some time
01/02/24, 9:57 am - Kunal: Indeed,
If I have to help you explain how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable compared to Local Universities, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now, if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, bringing the cost further down to $1000 per year including the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month. _This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly._

*You can see this even in this scholarship credit certificate where one of our star performers, our Proud Edoodians  Masinire Miriam earned $1965 within a year.* I hope you can now realize the power of the EWYL program to reduce the financial pressure on families?
01/02/24, 9:57 am - Kunal: <Media omitted>
01/02/24, 10:04 am - +263 77 957 2874: Yes now I fully understand sir ....actually I'm stunned about this program
01/02/24, 10:04 am - Kunal: Great, Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, a few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :

*1. Expert Career Counselling:* We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counsellors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.

*2. Affordability through guaranteed scholarships:* Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off.

*3. Earn While You Learn:* The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing our students for the real world. 

*4.Higher Education Concierge:* A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.*

After going through these facts that make Edoofa different, which one out of the 4 did you feel is the most significant?
01/02/24, 10:04 am - +263 77 957 2874: My new role model
01/02/24, 10:12 am - +263 77 957 2874: What is moat significant for me is the fourth fact .... this is a privilege as I see myself in the good hands ,people whom are willing to sacrifice their time to make sure that an African like me have top education and attain a bright future , I'm honored with the fact that if I come across some challenges in India, I have someone who can help me and also guide me, also this makes my parents not worry about their beloved son outside their reach as I will be in safe hands. This is the most significant fact in my own perspective.
01/02/24, 10:12 am - Kunal: Great! 
So now I know you focus more on quality education, services and guidance
Let me also show you some monthly earnings of students through Earn While You Learn.

01/02/24, 10:13 am - Kunal: There is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it  depends upon his/her hard work.
However may I know, who will be helping you with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
01/02/24, 10:21 am - +263 78 357 7548: I am sorry l can't because I am in a lesson and Dylan is in a lesson as well. May we shift to 13:30
01/02/24, 10:26 am - Kunal: That is fine
Ensure to let me know once anyone is available
01/02/24, 10:27 am - +263 77 957 2874: My mother will do so
01/02/24, 10:30 am - Kunal: That's completely understandable,
So, I believe you'll be discussing everything with them after we complete today's session. Also after our counseling session I would connect to some of our Beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know the proceedings well.

So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
01/02/24, 10:30 am - +263 78 357 7548: I will help him
01/02/24, 10:31 am - +263 78 357 7548: I as his mother am thrilled about the idea because l never had that opportunity so l would love to give my son that.
01/02/24, 10:40 am - Kunal: I am glad to hear that, studying Internationally would make your child’s career advance at an even greater pace, as your child will be transformed into a professional with a Greater Paying Job, which would help in uplifting your family and provide a hassle-free life.
01/02/24, 10:40 am - Kunal: *As we move to the last part of the session, let me highlight a few requirements while a student applies alone* 

*1) Application Form* -An online or offline form that asks for your personal details and academic background.

*2) Statement of Purpose-* An essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and your aspirations for your career.

*3) Letter of Recommendation-* from Senior authorities, School Heads or others on why they recommend you to be a right fit for an international university.
Do you know about other requirements?
01/02/24, 10:44 am - +263 77 957 2874: Pliz enlighten me about the other requirements
01/02/24, 10:44 am - Kunal: Absolutely, When a student applies alone for an international University, on average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose costs between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally and act as a major parameter to decide the child’s eligibility. If you apply to 5 Universities, the average costs for the mentioned would be $1350-$1750, *without even receiving a guarantee to be selected*

*Edoofa has identified a solution for this uncertainty and unaffordability.* If a student qualifies after the eligibility check, not only does Edoofa help them draft their statement of purpose but also helps in terms of Visa Documentation Assistance, University Session and selection, Individual mentorship, etc, reducing the costs significantly to $750 which is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
01/02/24, 10:44 am - Kunal: <Media omitted>
01/02/24, 10:57 am - +263 77 957 2874: Yes you can ....it will be helpful
01/02/24, 11:01 am - Kunal: The enrollment fee is to be paid only if a child is found eligible for the Edoofa Scholarship Program after passing the eligibility check stage, it includes, 

*Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
*Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
*Earn While You Learn Program and training*
*University sessions and selection*
*A guaranteed scholarship seat*
*Visa Documentation Assistance*
*The Foster and Care throughout the course of an Edoofian*
01/02/24, 11:01 am - Kunal: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge due to which parents might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short period of 7 days and for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option wherein if the student is found eligible, instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, *parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days thereby reducing the financial pressure.*
01/02/24, 11:02 am - +263 78 357 7548: <Media omitted>
01/02/24, 11:06 am - Kunal: Thank you for sharing

01/02/24, 11:11 am - +263 78 357 7548: Yes
01/02/24, 11:12 am - +263 78 357 7548: Stage 1
01/02/24, 11:12 am - Kunal: Well,
We are at stage one but we have also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.

In Step 1: Connect with a counsellor- As your counsellor, now we are going through the counselling process, discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

In Step 2:Eligibility Check- The eligibility check includes the interviews with Academic Board and Test.

Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa- If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program- This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.

We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
01/02/24, 11:13 am - +263 78 357 7548: Yes please
01/02/24, 11:14 am - Kunal: *Step 5:* After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors. They will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. will be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by paying the registration fee within a few weeks.

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education and the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).
01/02/24, 11:14 am - Kunal: Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment,you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.

I hope you are clear with the process.
01/02/24, 11:15 am - +263 78 357 7548: I am , and glad that there is team that help with the visa application process.
01/02/24, 11:17 am - +263 78 357 7548: While we are here we want Dylan to enrol for 2025 intake
01/02/24, 11:17 am - +263 78 357 7548: We are not ready yet for this year's intake.
01/02/24, 11:24 am - Kunal: May I know why, please?
01/02/24, 11:29 am - +263 78 357 7548: He is to re write mathematics at O level he didn't manage to pass that
01/02/24, 11:36 am - Kunal: He is writing the exams in June, right?
01/02/24, 11:43 am - +263 78 357 7548: No November, he can't write in June because of Continuous Assessment Learning Area which can not be completed in June <This message was edited>
01/02/24, 11:43 am - Kunal: That is fine, I will consider your application for the 2025 intake

*Step 5:* After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities. 

August 2025 intake applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.
01/02/24, 11:43 am - Kunal: This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 instalments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.
01/02/24, 11:44 am - Kunal: Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment,you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.

I hope you are clear with the process.
01/02/24, 11:46 am - +263 78 357 7548: Thank you very much. I appreciate it.
01/02/24, 11:47 am - Kunal: Alright Mrs Evermore
01/02/24, 11:47 am - Kunal: We have come to the end of your counselling session. Before I guide you Step 2 of the Eligibility Check, I want you to have a full-fledged discussion of the Edoofa program within your family as higher education is supposed to be a family decision. Ensure to include these aspects during the discussions:-

*About the EDOOFA Program and its vision of making Education Affordable and Edoofians Employment Ready.*
*Value of the career of an Edoofian after pursuing higher education in India.*
*The financial aspects and how Edoofa brings in affordability and self-financing opportunities for students.*
01/02/24, 11:47 am - Kunal: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences,

*Edoofa’s Website- www.edoofa.com* 
*Pictures (Edoofians from Africa studying in India): https://tinyurl.com/3ke35s35*

*Please ensure to go through the FAQ document before the next stage and refer the same to your family as it has answers to most of the queries.* Furthermore, if you have any other queries I would suggest that you note them down and we will discuss them in the next session.

Let me also share a few pictures of the students who are studying in India through the Edoofa Program so that you can witness the exposures and their experiences.

She got an internship(attachment) with an Indian Company and is now pursuing Masters's Program in India.

You can contact her and get to know more about the program. You can also request her to share with you her Offer Letter which she got from her Job. I am also sharing the contact of Valerie's Dad who is a retired Police Officer in Zimbabwe.


You can get in touch with them and learn about their experiences

01/02/24, 11:48 am - +263 78 357 7548: It is clear thank you
01/02/24, 11:50 am - +263 78 357 7548: Thank you. I am excited to get my son enrolled. I really am.
01/02/24, 11:59 am - +263 78 357 7548: Do you have Bachelor of Science Honours degree in Social Work? Apparently in the UK - where he wants to end up practicing social work - they only register if you did Social Work. You may address this later when you are free.
01/02/24, 3:19 pm - Kunal: Let me tell you that universities in India do not offer specialised degree in Social work, whereas we offer *B.A. (Hons.) in Sociology* which is a better course for students who are willing to pursue their career in Social work.

Embarking on a B.A. (Hons.) in Sociology opens a gateway to intertwine the realms of academia and impactful social work.
