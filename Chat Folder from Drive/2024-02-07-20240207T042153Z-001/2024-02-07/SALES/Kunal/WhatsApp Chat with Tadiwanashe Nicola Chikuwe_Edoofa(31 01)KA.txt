*I am Mr. Kunal, a Career Counselor at Edoofa, and with us, we have Mr. Jyotishman, the Head of Admissions, and Mr. Piyush, The Head of Counselling at Edoofa*


We have received an application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program for Tadiwanashe Nicola Chikuwe. 

I hope I have contacted the right person?

I am leaving you with a video to go through it properly.

06/02/24, 8:31 am - Kunal: Greetings to you all

I was waiting for you to share your concerns with me but unfortunately, I didn’t hear from you and therefore I was asked to put your application on hold, but before doing the same, I was going through the form you submitted, I noticed that you come from a family background wherein you plan to pursue your higher education abroad and was looking for a scholarship. I am looking forward to hearing from you so that I can make your dream of higher education abroad come true through an affordable, accessible, and employment-oriented higher education program.

*Please Note by tomorrow*, I would have to submit my final response regarding your application, so failure to get back to me would mean cancellation of your application after which you would have to re-apply
