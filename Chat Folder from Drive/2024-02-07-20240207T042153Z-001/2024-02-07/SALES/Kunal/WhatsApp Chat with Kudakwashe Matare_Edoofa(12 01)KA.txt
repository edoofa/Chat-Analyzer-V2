30/01/24, 4:57 pm - +263 78 688 3426: Ok sure so I am Kudakwashe Matare from Zvimba which is sited in Mashonaland West but I am currently residing in Harare. I am an U6 student at Mt Pleasant School. I’m a good volleyball player. My strength is my belief in the Almighty. I was born in a family of five (5) exclusive of my mother and father. I’m the middle child with two of my elder brothers self dependent and my younger brother and sister still in school. I’m a student interested in Business administration. I believe I want to achieve the masters degree in business administration. My father is currently serving his last year as a police officer in the Ministry of Home Affairs and my mother is not employed. My father is a graduate and on a sad note my mother could not finish up her O’Level. As mentioned earlier, two of my elder brothers are self dependent and are staying on their own with the other one staying with his wife. And the younger ones are in school, the one after me is in form 2 and the last born my sister she is in grade 2. Luckily up until now, my father haas been funding for my education. For my higher education abroad my family will be funding for my education. I also have stubborn faith in getting a scholarship that will help my family to cater for my education financially. I did my O Level at Howard High School and I am currently doing my A Level at Mount Pleasant High and back then our fees at Howard summed up to roughly a total of maybe $600 USD. The school fees at Mount Pleasant High is currently $150 USD.

Let me brief you that, I want to brief you that the criteria before the pandemic was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is *a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.
03/02/24, 11:34 am - +263 78 688 3426: You’re welcome
03/02/24, 11:36 am - +263 78 688 3426: Yes I am

Being an Edoofian will play a very crucial role as it is my foundation and my back bone when the course is involved

Shall we proceed?
06/02/24, 2:33 pm - +263 78 688 3426: Yes we can
06/02/24, 2:44 pm - Kunal: Amazing!
As I can see, you have understood the quality of higher education  which Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead.

By any chance are you familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship?
06/02/24, 2:49 pm - +263 78 688 3426: No I’m not
06/02/24, 3:00 pm - Kunal: Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth! 

In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc,it is still beyond the reach of many.
With the Edoofa Scholarship Program,the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library,Wifi,Laundry,etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
06/02/24, 3:00 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
06/02/24, 3:00 pm - Kunal: In simple words what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost $3000 or less a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well. 

However, as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even after this we allow the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.

*So do you feel the reduced cost of education is affordable to your family?*
06/02/24, 5:03 pm - Kunal: Let us connect at *10:00 am CAT Tomorrow to resume your session *(In case you have any challenges, please let me know the time you will be available, and we will schedule accordingly)*

Please note that your participation and activeness is an important parameters of evaluation. 

*In case the student is having lessons, the parents can also take part in the session*

Stay Blessed!
06/02/24, 5:13 pm - +263 78 688 3426: Well considering my families current financial issues, I doubt if they can afford it
