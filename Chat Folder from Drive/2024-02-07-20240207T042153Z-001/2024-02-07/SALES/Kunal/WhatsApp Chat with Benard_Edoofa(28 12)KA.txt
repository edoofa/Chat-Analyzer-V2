1 = distinction, 2 = distinction, 3 = credit, 4 = credit, 5 = credit, 6 = credit, 7 = pass, 8 = pass, 9 = fail

We accept upto 7=pass for a subject. Let us say a student has 5 subjects and scored 7 in all of them creating an aggregate of 35. This would be the maximum limit for eligibility. All students scoring an aggregate within this range would meet the academic requirement for the program. The minimum requirement was higher before the pandemic but during the pandemic, a lot of students failed to receive enough resources and Educational support which we had shared with the Universities and Ministries due to which the requirements have been lowered but I always encourage my students to target for maximum to increase the chances of Higher Quantum of Scholarship!

I believe you are confident about Benard meeting the requirements and performing well in MSCE.
08/01/24, 12:43 pm - Kunal: Please excuse me for some time as I am heading for my lunch. Let us connect at 1:45 pm CAT for the next part of our session. Let me know if you have any challenges with the schedule.

13/01/24, 10:50 am - Kunal: I am doing fine, thank you
13/01/24, 10:50 am - Kunal: Indeed, I believe your child would learn a lot from the exposures offered if found eligible and works hard to achieve the dreams. Moving ahead, by any chance are you familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?
13/01/24, 12:18 pm - +265 888 39 31 15: Yes around 8000 usd
13/01/24, 12:37 pm - Kunal: Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth! 

In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc,it is still beyond the reach of many.
With the Edoofa Scholarship Program,the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library,Wifi,Laundry,etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
13/01/24, 12:38 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
13/01/24, 1:20 pm - +265 888 39 31 15: Yes it's affordable
13/01/24, 1:23 pm - Kunal: Good to hear that
So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians.Looking at this cost of education also, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits and which can help you in reducing their fees further.
And do you know how that is done?
13/01/24, 2:56 pm - Kunal: Let us connect at *12:30 pm CAT Monday to resume your session *(In case you have any challenges, please let me know the time you will be available, and we will schedule accordingly)*

16/01/24, 11:17 am - Kunal: Let me tell you how Edoofa helps Edoofians bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the *Earn While You Learn Program*

The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that are equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable. The Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies and needs, converting an Individual into a market-ready professional. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
16/01/24, 11:17 am - Kunal: *Projects with Brands and Companies: -*
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, such as:
*Africa Global Radio-* The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project and hear from the CEO about the exposures of the Edoofa program.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0
*Skooqs-* This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

*Recruitment Partners:-*
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

*Webinars:-*
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars regularly with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
-Digitalization of Industries: How to Become an all-rounder in the Ever-changing Professional World by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.

16/01/24, 2:38 pm - +265 888 39 31 15: Yes this Earn while you learn program looks beneficial to me.Since it's giving a chance to increased scholarship to edoofians
16/01/24, 2:55 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
16/01/24, 2:55 pm - Kunal: Indeed,
If I have to help you explain how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable compared to Local Universities, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now, if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, bringing the cost further down to $1000 per year including the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month. _This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly._

*You can see this even in this scholarship credit certificate where one of our star performers, our Proud Edoodians  Masinire Miriam earned $1965 within a year.* I hope you can now realize the power of the EWYL program to reduce the financial pressure on families?
16/01/24, 2:55 pm - Kunal: This message was deleted
16/01/24, 3:06 pm - +265 888 39 31 15: Yes l have realised that.
16/01/24, 4:04 pm - Kunal: Great, Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, a few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :

*1. Expert Career Counselling:* We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counsellors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.

*2. Affordability through guaranteed scholarships:* Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off.

*3. Earn While You Learn:* The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing our students for the real world. 

*4.Higher Education Concierge:* A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.*

After going through these facts that make Edoofa different, which one out of the 4 did you feel is the most significant?
16/01/24, 4:17 pm - +265 888 39 31 15: The are all significant to me because all those are equally important.
16/01/24, 4:42 pm - Kunal: Great! 
So now I know you have grabbed the whole program very well
Let me also show you some monthly earnings of students through Earn While you Learn

16/01/24, 4:43 pm - Kunal: There is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it  depends upon his/her hard work.
However may I know, who will be helping Benard with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
16/01/24, 4:49 pm - +265 888 39 31 15: Am her mother and will do the remaining fees my self.
16/01/24, 4:50 pm - Kunal: That's completely understandable,
So, I believe you'll be discussing everything with them after we complete today's session. Also after our counseling session I would connect to some of our Beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know the proceedings well.

So may I know how your family feels about Benard studying abroad?
16/01/24, 4:54 pm - +265 888 39 31 15: The family feels so greatly honoured with this edoofa program.
16/01/24, 4:54 pm - Kunal: I am glad to hear that, studying Internationally would make your child’s career advance at an even greater pace, as your child will be transformed into a professional with a Greater Paying Job, which would help in uplifting your family and provide a hassle-free life.
16/01/24, 4:54 pm - Kunal: *As we move to the last part of the session, let me highlight a few requirements while a student applies alone* 

*1) Application Form* -An online or offline form that asks for your personal details and academic background.

*2) Statement of Purpose-* An essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and your aspirations for your career.

*3) Letter of Recommendation-* from Senior authorities, School Heads or others on why they recommend you to be a right fit for an international university.
Do you know about other requirements?
16/01/24, 4:59 pm - +265 888 39 31 15: This message was deleted
16/01/24, 5:01 pm - +265 888 39 31 15: Not sure of any other requirements.
16/01/24, 5:06 pm - Kunal: Let me guide you 
When a student applies alone for an international University, on average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose costs between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally and act as a major parameter to decide the child’s eligibility. If you apply to 5 Universities, the average costs for the mentioned would be $1350-$1750, *without even receiving a guarantee to be selected*

*Edoofa has identified a solution for this uncertainty and unaffordability.* If a student qualifies after the eligibility check, not only does Edoofa help them draft their statement of purpose but also helps in terms of Visa Documentation Assistance, University Session and selection, Individual mentorship, etc, reducing the costs significantly to $750 which is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
16/01/24, 5:06 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
16/01/24, 5:18 pm - Kunal: Shall we proceed?
16/01/24, 5:21 pm - +265 888 39 31 15: No let's proceed tomorrow
16/01/24, 5:21 pm - +265 888 39 31 15: 9;30 am CAT
16/01/24, 5:26 pm - Kunal: We are left with the last part of the session which will take only 10 minutes
16/01/24, 5:26 pm - Kunal: Shall we complete it?
16/01/24, 6:55 pm - +265 888 39 31 15: No am tied up.Sorry for the inconvenience
16/01/24, 6:55 pm - Kunal: Alright
17/01/24, 10:01 am - Kunal: Good morning to you all
How are you doing?
17/01/24, 10:15 am - +265 888 39 31 15: Am good and you?
17/01/24, 10:17 am - Kunal: I am doing fine, thank you
17/01/24, 10:17 am - Kunal: Please address this
17/01/24, 10:46 am - +265 888 39 31 15: Infirm me when the application fee is paid.
17/01/24, 10:47 am - +265 888 39 31 15: Inform
17/01/24, 10:48 am - Kunal: There are 3 phases to the enrollment process.
 
*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation
If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Acceptance Letter. You are supposed to pay the enrollment fee of $350 in 7 days for the scholarship seat reservation and to begin the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2*: Once the students complete Phase 1 they will be starting the Earn While You Learn program session(Each student will have an opportunity to earn scholarship credits that can be used to reduce their fee even before their MSCE result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final MSCE results are out and the student has passed the requirement as per Edoofa, then their final university evaluation and Admission will continue. However, if the student wouldn’t meet the requirements as per the university and Edoofa, then the $350 will be refunded to the parent.

The amount of credits earned by the student in phase 2 can be used for the first year’s annual fee itself so that parents are relieved from financial stress paving the way for proper financial planning for higher education.
17/01/24, 10:48 am - Kunal: The enrollment fee is to be paid only if a child is found eligible for the Edoofa Scholarship Program after passing the eligibility check stage, it includes, 

*Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
*Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
*Earn While You Learn Program and training*
*University sessions and selection*
*A guaranteed scholarship seat*
*Visa Documentation Assistance*
*The Foster and Care throughout the course of an Edoofian*
17/01/24, 10:48 am - Kunal: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge due to which parents might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short period of 7 days and for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option wherein if the student is found eligible, instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, *parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days thereby reducing the financial pressure.*
17/01/24, 10:48 am - +265 888 39 31 15: This message was deleted
17/01/24, 10:54 am - +265 888 39 31 15: Alright,this is very fine and well understood
17/01/24, 10:55 am - Kunal: <Media omitted>
17/01/24, 10:56 am - +265 888 39 31 15: Stage 3
17/01/24, 10:57 am - Kunal: Well,
We are at stage one but we have also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.

In Step 1: Connect with a counsellor- As your counsellor, now we are going through the counselling process, discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

In Step 2:Eligibility Check- The eligibility check includes the interviews with Academic Board and Test.

Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa- If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program- This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.

We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
17/01/24, 11:01 am - +265 888 39 31 15: Yes you can explain it all
17/01/24, 11:02 am - Kunal: *Step 5:* After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors. They will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. will be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by paying the registration fee within a few weeks.

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education and the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).
17/01/24, 11:02 am - Kunal: Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment,you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.

I hope you are clear with the process.
17/01/24, 12:32 pm - +265 888 39 31 15: Yes am clear with the process.Where l need support l will still ask you forvthat
17/01/24, 12:35 pm - Kunal: Alright please
We have come to the end of your counselling session. Before I guide you Step 2 of the Eligibility Check, I want you to have a full-fledged discussion of the Edoofa program within your family as higher education is supposed to be a family decision. Ensure to include these aspects during the discussions:-

24/01/24, 11:10 am - Kunal: May I know if you can respond now?
24/01/24, 11:19 am - +265 888 39 31 15: <Media omitted>
24/01/24, 11:27 am - +265 888 39 31 15: What will happen if the child hasn't met the minimum requirements for admission in university and may need to repeat his M.S.C.E. to get better results?Do you refund the fee or you keep it until child is successful?
24/01/24, 11:27 am - +265 888 39 31 15: Am responding above
24/01/24, 11:38 am - Kunal: Once the final MSCE results are out and the student has passed the requirement as per Edoofa, then their final university evaluation and Admission will continue. However, if the student doesn’t meet the requirements as per the university and Edoofa, then the $350 will be refunded to the parent.
24/01/24, 11:40 am - +265 888 39 31 15: Ok this is noted.And will he be given opportunity to rework on his results and reapply after he has met the requirement?

24/01/24, 11:41 am - Kunal: If we begin the eligibility check stage of your child today, it would be of 1-2 days after which the results will be out which means if your child qualifies for the Edoofa Scholarship, the due date for the first part of the enrollment fee ($200)will fall on the next week. Are you confident and comfortable with the timeframe?
24/01/24, 11:49 am - +265 888 39 31 15: Yes am comfortable but as l said the child is at school and will not be able to attend to this.Is it Okey with me only?
24/01/24, 11:51 am - Kunal: Yes, please
As you know, students are currently occupied with lessons and exam preparations due to which they are unavailable now. When you compare this with the Western African Countries students will be available with results much earlier thanMalawians, and there is a high chance that the scholarship seats would be occupied by them which in turn would be a loss for the students students. At the same time, the day scholars in Malawi are still applying and clearing the tests. 

All these factors have been a disadvantage for the boarding students, specifically the students who aren't supposed to use their devices in School. By the time they are back, the opportunity might be vacated by other applicants. This is the reason why our Academic Board along with the discussion with Universities has decided to allow parents to take part in the seat reservation interview for their children so that no deserving applicant is missed out.
24/01/24, 11:51 am - Kunal: *So are you willing to take up the Seat Reservation Interview call for Benard?
24/01/24, 11:52 am - +265 888 39 31 15: Alright,thank you
24/01/24, 11:53 am - +265 888 39 31 15: Yes am willing

26/01/24, 11:09 am - Kunal: So, may I know if you are clear with the modes of paying the enrollment fee?
26/01/24, 11:47 am - +265 888 39 31 15: Yes am clear.200 USD in 7 days and 150 in a month or all at once if able to do so

I am asking if you are clear on how to pay the enrollment fee?
26/01/24, 11:52 am - +265 888 39 31 15: Not very clear
26/01/24, 11:52 am - Kunal: You must have seen, there are two modes of fee payments mentioned:-

1. Direct Bank Transfer to our Parent Company's account
2. Deposit in our associate's account over there in Zimbabwe

Which mode according to you would be convenient, so that I can brief you in-depth about that particular mode?
26/01/24, 12:01 pm - +265 888 39 31 15: No 1
26/01/24, 12:02 pm - +265 888 39 31 15: Direct to your parent company account
26/01/24, 12:07 pm - Kunal: Mrs Glyceria, talking about the first mode, which is the Direct Bank transfer in our Account, basically because of the cash crisis in Zimbabwe, there are a limited Banks that allow International Transfer. These Banks are Barclays Bank and CBZ Bank, Nedbank and FBC Bank. If you have an account in any of these Banks then the transaction charges will then be $100 to $120 USD for any amount upto $1000 depending upon the bank. Please note that $350 should also be in USD. In case you have Zimbabwean Dollars, you will have to exchange that with USD and transfer charges on *every transaction* would also be $100 to $120.

Therefore, the Bank Details that are to be used in this mode are:

Swift code: AXISINBB207
IFSC code: UTIB0001147
Bank Name: Axis Bank Ltd.
Account Name: Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd.
Current Account Number: 917020070183626
Bank's Name:  Axis Bank Ltd.
Bank’s Address: Janakpuri, B Block, New Delhi[DL]
Ground Floor & Basement, B-1/503, Janakpuri, New Delhi 110058
26/01/24, 12:10 pm - +265 888 39 31 15: Ok fine.I will find out more from our banks here how l can do that
26/01/24, 12:20 pm - Kunal: Sure please, meanwhile for your better understanding, shall I brief you about the second mode as well?
29/01/24, 8:59 am - Kunal: Good morning to you @265888393115 
I hope you are doing fine
29/01/24, 9:00 am - Kunal: May I know if you checked the updated letter of Benard which was shared over email?
29/01/24, 9:47 am - +265 888 39 31 15: Let me check now
29/01/24, 9:49 am - Kunal: Let me share it here as well
29/01/24, 9:49 am - Kunal: <Media omitted>
29/01/24, 9:55 am - +265 888 39 31 15: Thank you l've seen it through email which was sent.Thats very fine now
29/01/24, 9:57 am - +265 888 39 31 15: Of course am a single parent since 2009 so the father is alive but we are no longer together and doesn't support Benard so congratulations to me and my son only.I indicated the father's name because l was asked to do so at some point.Just a clarification to you.
29/01/24, 9:58 am - Kunal: That is absolutely fine
29/01/24, 9:58 am - Kunal: Shall I brief you about the second mode as well?
29/01/24, 9:58 am - +265 888 39 31 15: Yes
29/01/24, 10:00 am - Kunal: Basically you see in the first mode, the Direct Bank Transfer Mode, the transfer charges which are to be borne by the parents of the student range between $100 to $120 which become quite high for a lot of parents considering the economic situation in Zimbabwe itself. So as not every student is in a position to cater for an additional $100 to $120 just as a transfer charge, the second mode was introduced, wherein, it is the Bank deposit in Mr. Charles's Account, in this the transfer charges get divided amongst 10 students resulting in an equivalent bearing of 12.5% at the end.
29/01/24, 10:00 am - Kunal: So as you can see in the letter that there is a Bank deposit in, Mr. Charles Jerera (Retired Education Officer)'s account as he is our Associated Partner there in Zimbabwe, Since 2020 there have been over 1400+ students who have been assisted by Mr Charles inorder to complete their enrollment formalities as well as university fee payments after arriving in India.
29/01/24, 10:00 am - Kunal: Therefore the fee can also be paid through him. Since his account is a NOSTRO Account which only holds USD itself, therefore the necessary amount including the transfer charges in this mode itself would be $394 ($350 + $44 transfer charges), and the same details are as below:-
