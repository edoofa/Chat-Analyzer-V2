07/09/23, 2:05 pm - +91 83840 48513: Good Afternoon Dear Parents and Fidelis, 

*“Some people want it to happen, some wish it would happen, others make it happen.” – Michael Jordan*

With that positive note I am here to continue with your session for the admission process. 

Shall we begin?
07/09/23, 2:08 pm - +263 78 252 8840: Yes
07/09/23, 2:10 pm - +91 83840 48513: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa share their recommendations and insights from their 13+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
07/09/23, 2:10 pm - +91 83840 48513: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $750. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
07/09/23, 2:44 pm - +91 83840 48513: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India for starting your dream education.

07/09/23, 5:18 pm - +263 78 252 8840: Yes we can start
07/09/23, 8:52 pm - +91 83840 48513: Good evening, Kindly excuse me for the delay in responding; our availability for the first slot has just concluded.
07/09/23, 8:52 pm - +91 83840 48513: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
07/09/23, 8:52 pm - +91 83840 48513: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftsGGGBYMrs&feature=youtu.be
08/09/23, 3:47 pm - +91 83840 48513: I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection. 

Please go through the 4 videos, our next session will be scheduled after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarize your understanding. Hence I would like to know by when do you think you will be able to go through these videos so that we can schedule our next session accordingly?
11/09/23, 10:17 am - +263 78 252 8840: I have finished watching the videos and on the statement of purpose I understand that I as a student, I have to diligently fill out the form and have to follow all the steps and instructions.
As for school colleges and universities under edoofa, one should follow instructions so as to be qualified for the prestigious institution
11/09/23, 10:17 am - +263 78 252 8840: Good morning
11/09/23, 10:47 am - +263 78 252 8840: For edoofa 's vision it is not always about getting affordable quality education but also encourages and increase the capacity for success of students
11/09/23, 8:10 pm - +91 83840 48513: Good Evening, dear parents and Fidelis.  I hope you are well and blessed. Kindly excuse me for being unable to connect with you further yesterday, as our available hours had already ended by the time you reached out. Please let me know if you are available so that we can proceed further with our session?
12/09/23, 3:58 am - +263 78 252 8840: I'm sorry for late response but can we have our session today during the day
12/09/23, 1:35 pm - +91 83840 48513: Good afternoon, dear parents and Fidelis.  I hope you are well and blessed. Kindly excuse me for being unable to connect with you further, as our available hours had already ended by the time you reached out. 


Please let me know if you are available so that we can proceed further with our session?
12/09/23, 1:35 pm - +263 77 781 4433: Iam available
12/09/23, 1:37 pm - +91 83840 48513: Thank you for sharing your understanding. I did go through your responses and I can see you did understand all the videos. 

In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent. 

The most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
12/09/23, 1:37 pm - +91 83840 48513: Talking about the third class, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
12/09/23, 1:37 pm - +91 83840 48513: Another thing I could see from your answer is that you learned how Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based.

You did understand that the Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
12/09/23, 1:37 pm - +91 83840 48513: Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
12/09/23, 1:40 pm - +263 77 781 4433: We are
12/09/23, 3:01 pm - +91 83840 48513: Brilliant, . Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.
12/09/23, 3:01 pm - +91 83840 48513: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by tomorrow 1:30 PM.
12/09/23, 3:01 pm - +91 83840 48513: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

15/09/23, 8:45 pm - +91 83840 48513: Thank you for providing the documents. With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey.

Before we delve into the forthcoming stage, I'd like to once again confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is BA (Geography) and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
16/09/23, 1:19 am - +263 78 252 8840: This message was deleted
16/09/23, 7:39 am - +263 78 252 8840: Yes it is
18/09/23, 7:53 pm - +263 78 252 8840: Good evening everyone
18/09/23, 7:55 pm - +91 83840 48513: Good Evening dear parents and Fidelis,

I trust this message finds you in good health and spirits. Kindly excuse me for being unable to connect with you further as it was a long weekend, our available hours had already ended by the time you reached out. Please, how was your weekend?
18/09/23, 8:11 pm - +263 78 252 8840: The weekend was good
18/09/23, 8:29 pm - +91 83840 48513: I'm glad to hear that. Could you let me know if you're available to continue the session at any time now?
19/09/23, 8:25 pm - +91 83840 48513: Good Afternoon, dear parents and Fidelis!

I trust this message reaches you in good health. I had been anticipating a response from you, but it seems my previous messages may have gone unnoticed. May I know if you are facing any challenges?
19/09/23, 8:36 pm - +263 78 252 8840: No there are no challenges we may continue
19/09/23, 8:38 pm - +263 78 252 8840: Sorry for not responding I was a bit tied so I slept early
19/09/23, 9:03 pm - +91 83840 48513: It is alright. Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*, are you ready to start with that?
20/09/23, 12:50 am - +263 78 252 8840: please my change the time, any time before 9pm can do it think that is the challenge
20/09/23, 8:21 pm - +263 78 252 8840: Good evening sir
20/09/23, 8:21 pm - +263 78 252 8840: May we proceed
20/09/23, 8:30 pm - +91 83840 48513: I am happy to hear that.
20/09/23, 8:31 pm - +91 83840 48513: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
20/09/23, 8:31 pm - +91 83840 48513: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
20/09/23, 8:31 pm - +91 83840 48513: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
20/09/23, 8:31 pm - +91 83840 48513: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
20/09/23, 8:33 pm - +263 78 252 8840: Yes continue
20/09/23, 8:34 pm - +91 83840 48513: Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
20/09/23, 8:34 pm - +91 83840 48513: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $750. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
20/09/23, 8:34 pm - +91 83840 48513: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
20/09/23, 8:38 pm - +263 78 252 8840: Yes
20/09/23, 8:48 pm - +91 83840 48513: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
20/09/23, 9:07 pm - +263 78 252 8840: Yes we are
20/09/23, 9:08 pm - +91 83840 48513: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:
20/09/23, 9:08 pm - +91 83840 48513: Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Registration Fee: $750 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum
20/09/23, 9:08 pm - +91 83840 48513: I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?
20/09/23, 9:12 pm - +263 78 252 8840: Yes and then
20/09/23, 9:25 pm - +91 83840 48513: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware your registration fee due is $750, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
20/09/23, 9:25 pm - +91 83840 48513: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $750 = $2050. This amount can be paid in two installments of $1025 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance can be paid through monthly installments, providing you with the flexibility to manage your finances effectively and ensure timely payment before the designated due dates.
21/09/23, 8:02 pm - +91 83840 48513: Good Evening, parents and Fidelis.

How is your afternoon going?
21/09/23, 8:04 pm - +263 78 252 8840: Good evening
21/09/23, 8:14 pm - +91 83840 48513: May I know if you are ready to proceed with our session for your admission process?
21/09/23, 8:32 pm - +263 78 252 8840: It is going well and you
21/09/23, 8:34 pm - +263 78 252 8840: Yes sir we may
21/09/23, 8:58 pm - +91 83840 48513: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
21/09/23, 8:58 pm - +91 83840 48513: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted toward your annual university fees.
21/09/23, 8:58 pm - +91 83840 48513: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
21/09/23, 8:58 pm - +91 83840 48513: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
21/09/23, 9:18 pm - +263 78 252 8840: No queries
21/09/23, 9:19 pm - +91 83840 48513: I am glad to hear that you have completely understood the admission process. Now, moving forward, I recently reviewed your application form once again and noted your preference to commence your EWYL journey in November 2023. Considering the reasons you've provided and the date of commencement in mind, we are prepared to initiate your EWYL program in November as agreed upon.
21/09/23, 9:19 pm - +91 83840 48513: In the meantime, we will focus on your admission journey. Now that you have a clear understanding of the admission process, I encourage you to have a discussion with your family regarding the financial requirements. This will allow them to plan effectively and move in the right direction.
21/09/23, 9:20 pm - +91 83840 48513: Given that your university admission is scheduled for the August 2024 intake, our next step is to reconnect with you and discuss when to commence the same journey. 

We have scheduled our session for Tomorrow at 3:00 p.m. to begin the admission process. Please ensure that both you and your parents are available for this session. We understand that unforeseen circumstances can arise, and if, for any reason, you or your parents cannot connect as planned, kindly inform us in advance.
21/09/23, 9:24 pm - +263 78 252 8840: Ok I will let you if there are changes and challenges
22/09/23, 3:01 pm - +263 77 781 4433: Hallow everyone
22/09/23, 7:27 pm - +91 83840 48513: Good evening, dear parents and my dear student,

I hope this message finds you well and blessed. Kindly excuse me for not being able to connect with you at our scheduled time today. I was currently occupied with a meeting with the admission team. So, I will connect with you on Monday at 3:00 PM. Have a great weekend, and my warm regards to your family as well.
22/09/23, 8:05 pm - +263 77 781 4433: Noted
25/09/23, 2:56 pm - +91 83840 48513: Good Afternoon.

As we embark on a fresh new week, how are you doing this lovely afternoon?
25/09/23, 2:58 pm - +263 78 252 8840: Good afternoon sir
25/09/23, 3:16 pm - +91 83840 48513: I am happy to hear that. May I know if you are ready to proceed with our session for your admission process?
25/09/23, 3:23 pm - +263 78 252 8840: Yes I am ready
25/09/23, 3:41 pm - +91 83840 48513: I am glad to hear that. Now, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
25/09/23, 3:41 pm - +91 83840 48513: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one.
25/09/23, 3:41 pm - +91 83840 48513: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
25/09/23, 3:41 pm - +91 83840 48513: <Media omitted>
25/09/23, 5:58 pm - +263 78 252 8840: Ok you may continue
25/09/23, 6:07 pm - +91 83840 48513: I am happy to hear that. The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
25/09/23, 6:07 pm - +91 83840 48513: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible.

25/09/23, 6:07 pm - +91 83840 48513: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs. So, May I know if you are ready for this?
25/09/23, 6:26 pm - +91 83840 48513: I'll be wrapping up our discussion for now as I need to connect with another batch of my students. To continue our conversation, I propose scheduling our session for tomorrow at 3:00 PM.

Wishing you a fantastic day, and please extend my warm regards to your wonderful family too.
26/09/23, 2:03 pm - +91 83840 48513: Good Afternoon, dear parents and Fidelis!

I hope you are doing well and blessed may I know if you are ready for the session for your admission process?
26/09/23, 2:18 pm - +263 77 781 4433: Iam alright and how are you
26/09/23, 2:45 pm - +91 83840 48513: I am well too. May I know if you are ready for the session for your admission process?
26/09/23, 2:47 pm - +263 77 781 4433: Yes sir
26/09/23, 2:49 pm - +91 83840 48513: I am pleased to hear that here you go!

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
26/09/23, 2:49 pm - +91 83840 48513: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

1. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

3. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
26/09/23, 2:49 pm - +91 83840 48513: *Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.*
26/09/23, 2:52 pm - +263 77 781 4433: I have read and understood
26/09/23, 2:57 pm - +91 83840 48513: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
26/09/23, 2:57 pm - +91 83840 48513: 1. On the basis of your A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, we will connect you with the Universities for an interactive session with them.

Upon completion, you will receive your letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees would be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa. I hope you are clear on this point?
26/09/23, 3:08 pm - +263 77 781 4433: Thank u
26/09/23, 3:14 pm - +91 83840 48513: 2. I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
26/09/23, 3:14 pm - +91 83840 48513: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
26/09/23, 3:14 pm - +91 83840 48513: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
26/09/23, 3:17 pm - +263 77 781 4433: Nice explanation
26/09/23, 3:19 pm - +91 83840 48513: 3. I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
26/09/23, 3:19 pm - +91 83840 48513: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
26/09/23, 3:21 pm - +263 77 781 4433: Yaa I do understand
26/09/23, 3:23 pm - +91 83840 48513: 4. I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
26/09/23, 3:24 pm - +91 83840 48513: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
26/09/23, 3:24 pm - +91 83840 48513: For instance, if your deadline is set for September 28, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before September 28, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by October 28, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
26/09/23, 3:26 pm - +263 77 781 4433: Ok ok I get it
26/09/23, 3:29 pm - +91 83840 48513: I am happy to hear that.  Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
26/09/23, 3:30 pm - +263 77 781 4433: Ok iam the parent of fidelis
26/09/23, 3:36 pm - +91 83840 48513: I have noted that as well, Mr. Shelton
26/09/23, 3:36 pm - +91 83840 48513: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
26/09/23, 3:37 pm - +91 83840 48513: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
26/09/23, 3:37 pm - +91 83840 48513: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
26/09/23, 3:37 pm - +91 83840 48513: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
26/09/23, 3:42 pm - +263 77 781 4433: I do understand
26/09/23, 3:44 pm - +91 83840 48513: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
26/09/23, 3:46 pm - +263 77 781 4433: This message was deleted
26/09/23, 3:52 pm - +91 83840 48513: Yes, that is indeed correct, I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
26/09/23, 3:56 pm - +263 77 781 4433: I do not agree with number 3
26/09/23, 4:03 pm - +91 83840 48513: Same as me as well. Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
26/09/23, 4:03 pm - +91 83840 48513: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
26/09/23, 4:08 pm - +263 77 781 4433: Good one
26/09/23, 4:10 pm - +91 83840 48513: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her interest in August 2024 itself.
26/09/23, 4:10 pm - +91 83840 48513: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
26/09/23, 4:11 pm - +263 77 781 4433: I do understand
26/09/23, 4:13 pm - +91 83840 48513: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
26/09/23, 4:15 pm - +263 77 781 4433: I do understand  I always encourage the student to work extra hard and get it once and for all .
26/09/23, 4:17 pm - +91 83840 48513: I am happy to hear that. Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
26/09/23, 4:19 pm - +263 77 781 4433: I don't have any
26/09/23, 4:23 pm - +91 83840 48513: I am glad to hear that. The admissions for the academic intake of August 2024 began last month, and as a result, students have already commenced their admission procedures.

As Fidelis's guardian, I hope you are enthusiastic about getting the process underway. Presently, 37 students have already secured their scholarship seats and have benefitted from the Endowment Program, leaving 63 positions available for this month. 

Let's embark on our efforts to ensure that Fidelis is among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you looking forward to the next steps and receiving his offer letter?
26/09/23, 4:26 pm - +263 77 781 4433: Iam sir 100 percent
26/09/23, 4:52 pm - +91 83840 48513: Thank you for your confirmation. With your approval, we will now proceed with the preparations for Fidelis's application and submit it to the universities recommended by the academic board, tailored to his chosen course. Once we receive updates from the universities, we will promptly reconnect with you and share all the relevant information.
26/09/23, 4:58 pm - +263 77 781 4433: Thanks
26/09/23, 5:01 pm - +91 83840 48513: On that note, we will conclude our discussion for today.

I wish you a blessed and productive day ahead, and please convey my regards to your family as well. If you ever need any assistance or have further questions, please don't hesitate to reach out.
26/09/23, 5:33 pm - +263 77 781 4433: Ok sir
02/10/23, 2:42 pm - +263 78 252 8840: Good afternoon
14/10/23, 8:43 am - +91 95407 16843: Good Morning Parents and Fidelis.
I hope you're all well and in high spirits!

I have some incredible news to share with you all! Since our last discussion, the admissions team has been diligently processing your scholarship applications for universities in India under the Endowment plan.

With all the efforts we've invested, I'm thrilled to inform you that your application has been accepted by PDM University in India, and they've decided to offer you a scholarship. Congratulations! Your journey to a brighter future starts now!
14/10/23, 8:44 am - +91 95407 16843: The university will soon send you the official offer letter. However, we've received it in advance and couldn't wait to share this exhilarating news. Please take your time to review the letter thoroughly.

In the meantime, I encourage you to note any questions or concerns. Being prepared with your queries will make our discussion more productive. Moving ahead, I am scheduling our next conversation for today at 12.30 PM CAT in which we will discuss the offer letter in detail and move ahead with the next steps in your admission journey. Congratulations to you and your family on this fantastic achievement! 🌟
14/10/23, 8:44 am - +91 95407 16843: <Media omitted>
14/10/23, 12:32 pm - +91 95407 16843: Good Afternoon Parents and Fidelis!

May I know if you were able to go through your offer letter from PDM University by now and if you are available to discuss the same in detail?
14/10/23, 2:17 pm - +263 78 252 8840: Good afternoon sir I was just busy
14/10/23, 3:01 pm - +91 95407 16843: That is alright please, dear, may I know if we can move ahead with our discussion here now?
14/10/23, 3:52 pm - +263 78 252 8840: Yes we can
15/10/23, 9:21 pm - +91 95407 16843: Good Evening Parents and Fidelis!
I hope you are doing well today.
15/10/23, 9:21 pm - +91 95407 16843: I'm sorry for going offline during our conversation earlier. I wasn't feeling well with a fever and had to take medicine. I'm back now and ready to continue with our conversation.
15/10/23, 9:21 pm - +91 95407 16843: Moving ahead, may I know if you were able to go through the offer letter by now please?
16/10/23, 4:35 am - +263 78 252 8840: Yes I have gone through it
16/10/23, 11:29 am - +91 95407 16843: Good Morning Parents and Fidelis!
I hope you are doing well today.
16/10/23, 11:29 am - +91 95407 16843: I am glad to hear that you have gone through your offer letter from PDM University, I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with any of the queries you have as well. For us to begin our conversation, I want you to look at the letter again and tell me the following so that I know you have read it well -

1) What’s your per annum tuition fee after the scholarship as mentioned in the letter? 
2) What's your accommodation/hostel fee per year, as mentioned in the letter?
3) You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
16/10/23, 8:39 pm - +263 78 252 8840: 1,. $1165
2. $1250
3. $750
16/10/23, 8:39 pm - +263 78 252 8840: I'm sorry for late reply I was busy
17/10/23, 1:01 pm - +91 95407 16843: Good Morning Parents and FIdelis!
I hope you are doing well today.
17/10/23, 1:01 pm - +91 95407 16843: That is alright please dear. Now, Yes, as you can see, after the scholarship your per annum tuition fee is $1165 and your per annum accommodation fee is $1250 which makes your per annum educational fee $1165 +$1250 = $2415. I hope you are clear about this?
17/10/23, 1:03 pm - +263 78 252 8840: Yes I understand
17/10/23, 1:04 pm - +91 95407 16843: That is good to know. Now when we talk about accommodation at PDM University, for the first year, it is recommended that the students opt for the on-campus hostel as they are new to the place and the university is in a better position to assist them with their FRRO.

From the second year, when they are familiar with the place and have made a few friends if they wish, they can move out of the on-campus accommodation and look for accommodation options outside the university campus.
17/10/23, 1:04 pm - +91 95407 16843: If you plan to stay outside the campus, your accommodation fee would be $1000 per annum and will have to be paid to the landlord of the place you stay. The average monthly rent would be $50 to $70 and the cost of food would be $20 to $30. 

This means, with the off-campus accommodation, your per annum cost would reduce to ($1165 + $1000) = $2165. Are you clear with this as well?
17/10/23, 1:11 pm - +263 78 252 8840: Yes it is clear
17/10/23, 4:27 pm - +91 95407 16843: I am glad to hear that, now as you are aware of your per annum fee, let me tell you what all facilities are offered by the universities and are covered as per the university's fee structure-

1. Tuition Fee
2. Living Cost
3. Food Cost
4. Library Fee
5. 24-Hour Wifi Cost
6. Gymnasium Fee
7. Maintenance Fee, Water Bill, and Electricity Bill.
17/10/23, 4:32 pm - +263 78 252 8840: Ok thanks for that may we continue
18/10/23, 12:56 pm - +91 95407 16843: Good Afternoon Parents and Fidelis!
I hope you are doing well today.
18/10/23, 12:56 pm - +91 95407 16843: Now that you know your per annum educational expenses for your education abroad, let me help you understand how you can make your education more affordable. 

Ideally, the complete per annum fee is to be paid by the student, however, students under the Edoofa Program have an additional opportunity of the EWYL Program. Because of that, you as a student can earn $800 to $1200 worth of scholarship credits in a year and use them to pay a part of your fee.
18/10/23, 12:56 pm - +91 95407 16843: I would also like to inform you that the above range shared does not mean that a student can earn credits only up to $1200. There is no upper limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits. 

In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his or her higher education, he/she can earn accordingly. Are you clear on this?
18/10/23, 1:04 pm - +263 78 252 8840: Yes
18/10/23, 2:03 pm - +91 95407 16843: Now, to understand how the EWYL Program helps you - Let us assume you earn scholarship credits worth $1000 in a year with the help of the EWYL Program.

Now with this, you can use the earned $1000 to pay a part of your per annum fee of $2165 (with the off-campus accommodation) and so the balance fee becomes $2165 - $1000 = $1165 which will have to be paid by your parents/guardians at a stretch of one year.

With this, I believe you are able to see how you can make your education more affordable and reduce your family's financial pressure?
18/10/23, 2:19 pm - +263 78 252 8840: Understood it
18/10/23, 2:20 pm - +91 95407 16843: It is good to know we are on the same page and I hope you will be working hard in the EWYL Program to reduce your cost of education, your mentors would indeed guide you in the right direction so that you can achieve all the targets you set for yourself. Now, let us move forward to the registration fee mentioned in your offer letter as well -

As informed, for the first year, the registration fee of $750 will be adjusted against your first year fee itself, therefore the amount of fee that you will be required to pay after you come to India will be as below -
18/10/23, 2:21 pm - +91 95407 16843: 1. If you go with the *Off-campus accommodation*, only your tuition fee is to be paid to the university which means, your fee balance becomes $1165 - $750 = $415 and this will have to be paid in one part on your arrival. 

2. If you go with the *On-campus accommodation*, you will have to pay the tuition fee of $1165 and your accommodation fee of $1250, which means the total fee to be paid to the university is $2415 and after your registration fee has been adjusted, the balance will be $2415 - $750 = $1665 which can be paid in two installments of $832 & $833. (August 2024/January 2025)

I hope you are clear with this and we are on the same page here as well?
18/10/23, 2:39 pm - +263 78 252 8840: Yes we are on the same page
18/10/23, 2:49 pm - +91 95407 16843: Now, as per the offer letter, you are supposed to pay the registration fee of $750 to reserve your scholarship seat with the university within 15 days.
18/10/23, 2:49 pm - +91 95407 16843: But, with regards to our previous conversations, I am sure you recall that you have the privilege to get the $150 grant as well as to make the payment of the same in two parts as below -

1. *$300 before 28th October 2023.*
2. *$300 before 28th November 2023.*
18/10/23, 2:49 pm - +91 95407 16843: Alternatively, if you are financially prepared, you can pay the complete fee of $600 within 15 working days by *28th October 2023*. I hope you are clear with this and we are on the same page.
18/10/23, 10:05 pm - +91 95407 16843: Fidelis, may I know if you are clear till here so that we can move ahead with our discussion?
18/10/23, 11:41 pm - +263 78 252 8840: Yes it is clear sir
19/10/23, 4:00 pm - +91 95407 16843: Good Afternoon Parents and Fidelis!
I hope you are doing well today.
19/10/23, 4:00 pm - +91 95407 16843: Alright, please. Now, let us come to the payment mode for your university registration fee due -

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
19/10/23, 4:00 pm - +91 95407 16843: There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
19/10/23, 9:14 pm - +263 77 781 4433: Nearest town is mutare
19/10/23, 9:15 pm - +91 95407 16843: Thank you for sharing this with me. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
19/10/23, 9:15 pm - +91 95407 16843: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
19/10/23, 9:15 pm - +91 95407 16843: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
19/10/23, 9:18 pm - +263 77 781 4433: Thanks
19/10/23, 9:23 pm - +91 95407 16843: Alternatively, I was also going through your application file and noticed that you made a deposit of your enrollment fee through Mr. Charles's FBC Bank Account.

If you want to use the same mode of payment for your university registration fee, you can do that as well since it would be feasible and the International Transfer Charges are 12.5% of the amount you want to send. Shall I share the account details with you once again for your reference?
19/10/23, 9:39 pm - +263 77 781 4433: That one of Mr kawadza
19/10/23, 9:40 pm - +91 95407 16843: Excuse me for the same please. Alright please, if making the payment through Mr. Shorwi is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

Bank Name: FBC
Branch: Mutare
Account Holder Name: Kawadza Shorwi
Account Number: 5333038009240398
Contact Number: +263 77 364 0738
19/10/23, 9:40 pm - +263 77 781 4433: Thanks
19/10/23, 9:41 pm - +91 95407 16843: You are most welcome. Now, before we move forward and conclude our conversation regarding your offer letter from PDM University, may I ask if you have any queries you would like to ask?
19/10/23, 9:42 pm - +263 77 781 4433: So far I do not have
19/10/23, 9:44 pm - +91 95407 16843: Alright, please. In that case, Let me also share a few insights into the university with you -
19/10/23, 9:44 pm - +91 95407 16843: PDM University stands for Prabhu Dayal Memorial University and is located in Delhi, India. It is a relative university that got the status of a University after a very successful period as an Institution. 

The University status was allocated by the Government in the year 2016 and before that, it was an Institution. This university is located in the Metropolitan City in India with Access to metro connectivity. The University in a short span of 5 years has climbed many ladders and with its success, the Government has built a Metro station that connected the entire city through Metro Rail.

I hope you are doing well.

Following our earlier conversation, I believe you and your family must be very excited about the opportunity you have received from PDM University. Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion, and I can only imagine the enthusiasm that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.

Moving ahead, have you had the chance to discuss the offer letter from PDM University as a family yet?
20/10/23, 2:43 pm - +263 78 252 8840: Good afternoon how are you and yes we have
20/10/23, 2:50 pm - +91 95407 16843: It's wonderful to hear that you've had a family discussion about the offer letter, and I'm confident that you must all be delighted to witness the positive strides being made toward realizing your higher education goals in India.

As you move forward, I'm curious to know how your family conversation went. What are your thoughts and feelings regarding the discussion?
23/10/23, 10:15 am - +91 95407 16843: Good Morning Parents and Fidelis!
I hope you are doing well today.
23/10/23, 10:16 am - +91 95407 16843: I was expecting a response from your side here earlier so that we could have moved ahead with our discussion regarding the offer letter from PDM University as well as your admission process. Now, moving ahead, shall we continue with our conversation here about the same?
23/10/23, 3:37 pm - +263 78 252 8840: I'm sorry for not responding I was busy, they are happy with that and they are preparing for the money needed
23/10/23, 3:37 pm - +263 78 252 8840: Good afternoon sir
24/10/23, 10:02 pm - +91 95407 16843: Good Evening Parents and Fidelis!
I hope you are doing well today.

As you may know, today was Dussehra, a significant festival here in India, and our team was not available due to the holiday. On this auspicious occasion of Dussehra, I also extend my warmest wishes to you and your family. May the festival bring joy, prosperity, and success into your life. ✨

On that note, I would like to schedule a conversation with you at 12:30 PM CAT tomorrow to continue with our discussion here about your admission process. I look forward to our discussion tomorrow, until then have a blessed evening!
24/10/23, 10:02 pm - +91 95407 16843: <Media omitted>
25/10/23, 1:55 pm - +263 78 252 8840: There were happy about the offer letter and they are preparing admission fee. I have also visited the university website and l happy about the place and its surroundings
25/10/23, 1:56 pm - +263 78 252 8840: Father will let you know about the payments
25/10/23, 2:03 pm - +91 95407 16843: I'm glad to see that your family is so pleased with the offer letter, and it's wonderful to hear about their positive thoughts regarding it. Moving forward, after your recent family discussion regarding the offer letter, we genuinely want to ensure that you have all the necessary information and support you may require. Therefore, I'd like to ask if you would like me to address any specific questions or concerns regarding the offer letter before proceeding further?
25/10/23, 2:27 pm - +263 78 252 8840: Yes you can
25/10/23, 2:28 pm - +91 95407 16843: That's great to hear. If you have any questions or require assistance with any aspect of the admission process, please don't hesitate to share them with me. I'm here to engage in a meaningful discussion and offer my support to help you plan effectively. Moving forward, may I inquire if you had the opportunity to conduct further research about the university and learn more about it?
25/10/23, 2:31 pm - +263 78 252 8840: As of now I do have that opportunity
25/10/23, 2:45 pm - +91 95407 16843: That is alright, please. I would advise you to do that. As you explore this opportunity further, I’m sure that you are committed to completing the registration process and securing the scholarship seat.

Now, since the university has given you a date of 28th October to complete the registration process, you have two options to do that, one is a $300 payment, and the other is a single payment of $600. Have you had a chance to consider which payment plan you'd like to proceed with?

I hope you are doing well today.

Kindly excuse me for not being able to connect with you in the admissions group since last Friday. Unexpectedly, my schedule became quite busy, and the weekend turned out to be quite hectic, which made it challenging for us to respond during that time.
06/11/23, 11:44 pm - +91 95407 16843: Additionally, I've noticed that for some time now, our communication has been hindered by various factors such as time constraints, network issues, and other unforeseen circumstances. To ensure a more consistent connection going forward, starting tomorrow, we'll establish a regular time for our discussions at 07:30 PM CAT. This dedicated time will allow us to thoroughly address any pending discussions and smoothly progress with the admission process. On that note, I will connect with you tomorrow at 07.30 PM, until then, have a blessed evening ahead.

07/11/23, 8:51 pm - +91 95407 16843: Now, Fidelis, earlier when we were connected with each other here, you had mentioned that the finances for the same are not balancing, moving ahead, can you please help me in understanding about what happened that caused these challenges for you?
07/11/23, 9:09 pm - +263 78 252 8840: I don't know what happened exactly but that what father told me so I will ask him to answer you
07/11/23, 9:41 pm - +91 95407 16843: I did not get you well here dear, were you able to discuss that with your father about the challenges that he is facing?

08/11/23, 9:45 pm - +91 95407 16843: Fidelis, can you please let me know of this as well?

16/11/23, 8:04 am - +263 78 252 8840: Yes that is true sir I am trying my best let's see how it will end

With great excitement and pride, I also want to share that over the past few days, the Edoofa team has been immersed in an exciting event we had in store for our students. Edoofa hosted a conference - the Symposium of Leaders, Innovators, and Creators at Edoofa, also known as 'SLICE-CON.'
16/01/24, 8:16 pm - +91 72920 63289: The conference was attended by all the Edoofians of 2023 and a few senior Edoofians from previous batches. It focused on the art of creation, innovation, and, most importantly, the mindset required to make an impact in one's career.
16/01/24, 8:16 pm - +91 72920 63289: During this Industrial Visit and the conference - SLICE CON, Corporate leaders, such as the CEOs and Co-founders from renowned companies like Rage Coffee, Sirona Hygiene, Jolin New York, and more, shared their insights and experiences. These individuals are at the helm of multi-millionaire brands, leading large marketing teams. Their presence added immense value, providing students with the opportunity to engage in transformative conversations.
16/01/24, 8:16 pm - +91 72920 63289: We believe that interactions with such industry leaders can bring significant transformations to students' lives, enhancing their business acumen. Our Edoofians maximized this opportunity, having life-changing conversations with these influential figures. The main objective of the event was to emphasize the importance of thinking outside the box, and encouraging students to believe in themselves and their dreams. Before we discuss your admission journey further, I wanted to share a glimpse of the event, and I hope you are excited to attend similar events when you come to India.

In light of this, I had a discussion with Ms. Sanjana, the head of the EWYL Department, and I am happy to share that she has graciously agreed to make a special exception for you, expediting your application process.
06/02/24, 8:26 pm - Shubham Madhwal: As a result, I have gone ahead and created your very own dedicated EWYL Group - *Fidelis EWYL23E0634*, adding both you and your parents to the mix. If I have missed including any other family members, they can easily join using the following link: [https://chat.whatsapp.com/DjpJVnKCQHV2WJGGaFJzNX].

Within the group, the EWYL team will not only guide you on the hows and whens of the EWYL Program but also share all the exciting details about the upcoming Meet and Greet Seminar in Harare. We are genuinely thrilled to witness you embark on this transformative journey, and we are rooting for your success every step of the way!

Warmest regards,
Admissions Team.
