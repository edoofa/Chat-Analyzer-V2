02/02/24, 11:26 am - Harmehak: Well Keren now as we proceed ahead, I would like to your thoughts on higher education abroad!

Do you believe it's a life changing decision?
02/02/24, 11:37 am - +263 77 305 8214: Yes I believe it is. Especially considering the education standards and reputation of the nation of India. I strongly believe my life will completely change when I achieve a  recognised degree  from an accredited university in India through Eddofa Schoolarship Program. Thank you
02/02/24, 11:42 am - Harmehak: I am delighted to know that you have thorough awareness,

In such a scenario, would you add that you are mentally prepared for a life abroad too, Keren?
02/02/24, 11:54 am - +263 77 305 8214: I am prepared for a life abroad. I think life in a boarding school for the past six years being far away from my family has prepared me for that. I think I am ready to adapt to a new environment and setup. Thank you
02/02/24, 12:17 pm - Harmehak: Keren, I am delighted to see your dedication and I believe you would agree with me that commitment from your parents is equally important!

So now could you please share, if your family members are aware of your plans to study abroad and if they are willing to support your higher education abroad mentally and financially?
02/02/24, 12:30 pm - +263 77 305 8214: Thank you Ms Harmehak. I am delighted to advise that my parents place much value on education. They always encourage us to do better than they did. I have a strong support of my parents and they also respect my career choices as we always engage in discussions regarding to career choice. 
I should say they are prepared to support my education abroad. Thank you
02/02/24, 12:32 pm - Harmehak: I am delighted to know regarding their support and preparation, Keren!

I believe you must be aware of Munashe Hlahla from the school?
02/02/24, 12:38 pm - +263 77 305 8214: Yes I am aware, we are together at Mt Selinda. I am happy for her success with Edoofa Schoolarship. 
I was just thinking that I won't feel lonely in India if I happen to be successful. Thank you
02/02/24, 12:41 pm - Harmehak: I am glad to know that you and Munashe are good friends, Keren!
02/02/24, 12:41 pm - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!
02/02/24, 12:48 pm - +263 77 305 8214: We are best friends from the same school and also from the same community. It is our wish to sail through higher education together and transform our community.
02/02/24, 12:50 pm - +263 77 305 8214: That's fine Ms Harmehak. I promise to work hard and do my best. I am aiming at 15 points.
02/02/24, 12:52 pm - Harmehak: That's wonderful, Keren!
02/02/24, 12:52 pm - Harmehak: I am delighted to know that, Keren!

So what motivates you to study Pharmacy or Medicine?
02/02/24, 1:05 pm - +263 77 305 8214: The pandemics that sometimes hit our nation, like covid which was global, and the high demand for medical personnel worldwide motivates me choose this career path. I love to see people in good health and healthy communities. The study of this program will make me help contribute to the health of communities and countries. Thank you
02/02/24, 1:05 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate your noble thoughts to help others, Keren!
02/02/24, 1:06 pm - Harmehak: So what all did you research regarding your desired course and it's requirements?
02/02/24, 1:20 pm - +263 77 305 8214: From the research I did I noted that it needs a good combination of subjects at A level to help prepare for the course. For instance, Maths, Biology and Chemistry which is my choice.

Again, someone must be a natural leader and I am happy to share with you that I am currently Prefect at Mt Selinda and it is helping me shape my leadership skills.
 In addition to that, I need much patience as this will help me deal with patients. Thank you
02/02/24, 1:23 pm - +263 77 305 8214: Again, I learnt that the field is a calling which is different from other fields and it requires commitment and dedication.
02/02/24, 1:24 pm - Harmehak: Well put across, Keren!

I appreciate your knowledge, research as well as your thoughts!
02/02/24, 1:24 pm - Harmehak: Since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*. whereas if they want to study any Engineering Course then they should have *Physics and Maths* in their A level mandatorily.
02/02/24, 1:36 pm - +263 77 305 8214: Well noted Ms Harmehak. May I ask Ma'am, what would you advise is the ideal career with my combination of subject and also in line with Edoofa Program7
02/02/24, 1:42 pm - Harmehak: Keren, majority of the time Zimbabwean students study subjects as per Zimbabwe's requirements, therefore, the only courses left that these students could pursue ahead which would also align with the healthcare sector are 

1. *Bachelor of Science in Biotechnology*

2. *Bachelor of Science in Nutrition and Dietetics*

3. *Bachelor of Science in Microbiology*

4. *Bachelor of Science in Chemistry*

5. *Bachelor of Science in Medical Laboratory Technology*

6. *Bachelor of Science in Cardiovascular Technology*

7. *Bachelor of science in Physiotherapy*
02/02/24, 1:43 pm - Harmehak: Now you see, Medical Laboratory Technology (MLT) and Pharmacy may seem distinct, but they share fundamental similarities that contribute to the holistic field of healthcare.

Both fields are critical in patient care. MLT professionals analyze biological samples, providing essential data for diagnosis and treatment plans. Pharmacists, on the other hand, ensure that prescribed medications are dispensed accurately, educating patients on proper usage and potential interactions.

Continuous learning is a common thread. MLT and Pharmacy professionals stay up-to-date with advancements in medical science and pharmacology, ensuring that patients receive the most current and effective care.

Ultimately, both fields share a deep commitment to improving patient health. They complement each other, creating a collaborative healthcare ecosystem that prioritizes accurate diagnosis, safe medication management, and better overall patient outcomes. In essence, Medical Laboratory Technology and Pharmacy are two sides of the same coin, working harmoniously for the betterment of healthcare.
02/02/24, 1:54 pm - +263 77 305 8214: Thank you Ms Harmehak for guidance, I think let me take Bachelor of Science in Medical Laboratory Technology. I am still comfortable with that because its medical field. Thank you
02/02/24, 1:55 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate your thorough understanding, Keren.

I am glad that you following the discussion properly and sharing your inputs as well!

02/02/24, 2:15 pm - Harmehak: You're very welcome Keren!
02/02/24, 2:15 pm - Harmehak: As of now, would you like to ask anything from our discussion so far?
02/02/24, 2:19 pm - +263 77 305 8214: So far so good Ms Harmehak, I  think I will be able to ask as we proceed. Thank you
02/02/24, 2:24 pm - Harmehak: Alright please.
02/02/24, 2:24 pm - Harmehak: Keren, since you have understood the course, can you please tell me, if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself in 5 years and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?

That is from financial assistance, enrolment with the best university in India and also facilitation of travels and stay abroad which I think Edoofa will be coordinating and make my study easy.
02/02/24, 2:41 pm - Harmehak: That is really great Keren, I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations!

Now, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
02/02/24, 2:50 pm - +263 77 305 8214: I would want to study abroad especially India due to its reputation in the Medical Field. I have always heard about many patience refered to India for complicated cases and these are successfully managed. That to. me signifies magnificent knowledge in the Medical Field and I would wish to be part of that. Thank you.
02/02/24, 2:51 pm - +263 77 305 8214: *patients*
02/02/24, 3:01 pm - Harmehak: That is correct, Keren!

Now as you know Edoofa Recommends India as a Higher Education destination.

*May I know what is your knowledge or what have you researched about India and Indian Education System which makes you feel that studying in India would help you achieve your dreams?*
02/02/24, 3:16 pm - +263 77 305 8214: Well from the research I have done India has the best Education System in the world  and it produces highly qualified professionals as compared to other countries. Its balanced approach system which incorporates culture in learning makes it unique and will help me appreciate diverse cultures in the process of achieving my dreams.
02/02/24, 3:18 pm - Harmehak: That's wonderful, Keren.
02/02/24, 3:18 pm - Harmehak: Alright please, let me add to it, you see over the past 6 years, the Edoofa Scholarship Program is only focused in India, because of the following reasons:

02/02/24, 3:34 pm - Harmehak: I am glad this intrigued you and you found it helpful, Keren

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
02/02/24, 3:38 pm - +263 77 305 8214: No, I haven't done a research on that one. Kindly advise.
02/02/24, 3:38 pm - Harmehak: Alright please!
02/02/24, 3:38 pm - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
02/02/24, 3:38 pm - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
02/02/24, 3:38 pm - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
02/02/24, 3:38 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
02/02/24, 3:48 pm - +263 77 305 8214: That's sounds  great and will make families afford education for us children. I think this program makes education accessible and fulfilment of all dreams regardless of background and nationality. I would like to thank you for coming up with such an idea/program.
02/02/24, 3:50 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate your kind words, Keren!
02/02/24, 3:50 pm - Harmehak: In simple words Keren, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
02/02/24, 3:50 pm - Harmehak: However as per my experience, I can share with you that *if you are able to perform and clear all these criteria with a high passing grade, you would be eligible for higher quantum of Scholarship*, in which you will just have to pay a minimal fee of *$1200-$1800*, Which would cover your entire fees be it food, accommodation, Tuition etc.

What are your thoughts on the same?
02/02/24, 3:57 pm - +263 77 305 8214: I understand and will work towards achieving high passing grades and am also interested in Earn While You Work Program which I view again as a privilege to acquire skills. Thank you
02/02/24, 3:57 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

Now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program in detail and how it would assist you.
02/02/24, 3:57 pm - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
02/02/24, 3:58 pm - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
02/02/24, 3:58 pm - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

02/02/24, 3:58 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
02/02/24, 4:04 pm - +263 77 305 8214: Well noted. It is such a wonderful program.
02/02/24, 4:09 pm - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $1800 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$600 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $50-$60 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
02/02/24, 4:11 pm - +263 77 305 8214: I understand.
02/02/24, 4:13 pm - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

02/02/24, 4:16 pm - +263 77 305 8214: That's great, I think would go for this program.
02/02/24, 4:17 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate!
02/02/24, 4:17 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
02/02/24, 4:22 pm - +263 77 305 8214: Sure that's my first time to hear of such program and I have noted how it supports students and the financial impact of the program with regards to tuition etc  Thank you
02/02/24, 4:23 pm - Harmehak: That is great, Keren!

So Keren, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes. 

Are you ready?
02/02/24, 4:24 pm - +263 77 305 8214: Yes am ready.
02/02/24, 4:24 pm - Harmehak: Keren, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
02/02/24, 4:25 pm - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
02/02/24, 4:27 pm - +263 77 305 8214: That will be a minimum of usd 1500
02/02/24, 4:29 pm - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
02/02/24, 4:29 pm - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
02/02/24, 4:29 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
02/02/24, 4:35 pm - Harmehak: You see, Keren, Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
02/02/24, 4:38 pm - +263 77 305 8214: Yes I think so. Bundling everything will make the process much easier.
02/02/24, 4:41 pm - Harmehak: That's amazing, so now that you have understood how Edoofa makes the application process affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
02/02/24, 4:41 pm - Harmehak: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

Phase 3: Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.
02/02/24, 4:41 pm - Harmehak: *However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
02/02/24, 4:47 pm - +263 77 305 8214: Well noted. I think it is clear.
02/02/24, 4:47 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
02/02/24, 4:47 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
02/02/24, 4:48 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle.
02/02/24, 4:48 pm - Harmehak: Step 5: After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities. 

August 2025 intake, applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from the Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 instalments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.
02/02/24, 4:48 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
02/02/24, 4:54 pm - +263 77 305 8214: Yes we are together Ms Harmehak.
02/02/24, 4:55 pm - Harmehak: Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.
02/02/24, 4:55 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
02/02/24, 5:01 pm - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
02/02/24, 5:01 pm - Harmehak: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)
02/02/24, 5:01 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
02/02/24, 5:05 pm - +263 77 305 8214: Thank you, received. I get in touch with her.
02/02/24, 5:06 pm - Harmehak: Sure please.

Do request your parents to connect as well Keren.
02/02/24, 5:11 pm - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
02/02/24, 5:11 pm - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
02/02/24, 5:11 pm - Harmehak: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

02/02/24, 5:11 pm - Harmehak: Dear Parents and Keren,

Your scholarship journey is reaching a crucial juncture. *Tomorrow on “03-02-23” at 9 A.M. CAT,* I will meticulously evaluate your application. This session is not just about answering your questions; it includes a vital Eligibility Check Interview.

We strongly recommend parents/guardians join, recognizing that higher education is a family decision. Prepare for a series of interviews, marking a significant phase in finalizing your scholarship application. As your counselor, I wish you the very best. It's been a pleasure guiding you through your career sessions.

If you qualify for the interview, we would proceed ahead and we look forward to welcoming you to India. Please be proactive, as everyone's time is valuable. The Senior Counselor and Director will make decisions based on your interview and adhere strictly to the given time. Follow instructions diligently, and if the session is completed within the allotted time, your application will proceed.

Happy Family Discussion!
Stay Blessed!
02/02/24, 5:22 pm - +263 77 305 8214: Well noted, my family will be ready for the interview session. I would like to thank you for today's session and your time. I learnt a lot from the interactive session we just had. Thank you
02/02/24, 5:25 pm - Harmehak: You're very welcome and I appreciate your kind words, Keren!

Wishing you a blessed day ahead!
03/02/24, 8:57 am - Harmehak: Good Morning Everyone, Hope you are doing well.

I believe you must have discussed all the above mentioned points with your family?

I am here to address any questions if they have any.

Are we good to proceed with your application now?
03/02/24, 9:19 am - +263 77 305 8214: Good Morning to you all. I trust I find you well. 
My name is Alec Dunuza and I am the father of Keren Hapuk.
First and foremost I would like to appreciate your efforts to reach us and also the time you took with my daughter guiding her through her career.  I also would want to thank you for consideration of her application.

We had ample time with Keren and she took us through what you shared with her and we really happy with the program.

Maybe if I may ask one question Ms Harmehak.
 On application for University enrolment when one selects 5 Universities of her choice is it guaranteed that she will be enrolled at least in one of these Universities. Are the chances very high such that you don't need to apply to the sixth University.
Thank you
03/02/24, 9:22 am - Harmehak: I appreciate your kind words, Mr Alec!
03/02/24, 9:22 am - Harmehak: Mr Alec this is the case of students who happen to apply by themselves for international education!
03/02/24, 9:22 am - +263 77 305 8214: Again,  what other espenses are we expected to cover as parents aside from those which are covered with the Usd2000-3000?
03/02/24, 9:23 am - Harmehak: However, Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission!

During the admissions process, you would not receive just one rather multiple applications!
03/02/24, 9:24 am - Harmehak: If she happens to get *higher quantum of Scholarship*, 

$1200-1800 would include -

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
03/02/24, 9:29 am - +263 77 305 8214: Thank you Ms Harmehak. I think I am answered. We shall encourage Keren to work hard, of which I believe she will score high grades as she has a determination.  Thank you
03/02/24, 9:29 am - Harmehak: That's wonderful,

I appreciate your support for Keren!
03/02/24, 9:30 am - +263 77 305 8214: You can proceed with her application, we will fully support her.
03/02/24, 9:31 am - Harmehak: I am glad to know that, Mr Alec!
03/02/24, 9:31 am - Harmehak: Have you already had the opportunity to connect with Mrs. Ruth? 

You see, her story is truly remarkable. As a single parent, juggling the responsibilities of a small-scale farmer and the mother of two daughters, she has persevered. Her journey with Edoofa is a testament to how dedicated individuals can overcome obstacles.
Mrs. Ruth's experience with Edoofa is a testament to the transformative impact our programs can have. She not only managed her family's needs but also seized the opportunity for her daughters to achieve higher education. The support and guidance she received from Edoofa were instrumental in her success. The process was challenging, yet incredibly rewarding. Mrs. Ruth's determination, combined with Edoofa's assistance, has paved the way for a brighter future.
03/02/24, 9:39 am - +263 77 305 8214: Will be getting in touch with her today.
Her situation is just  like ours. We both lost our jobs with my wife in 2020 due to Covid and since then we are working hard to provide for the family and support their education. I believe you guys have come to our rescue at the right time. We really appreciate what you are doing. Thank you
03/02/24, 9:41 am - Harmehak: I do understand please!

The same being the reason I happened to connect you with Mrs Ruth!

Do connect with the guardian of Keren's best friend Munashe, Mrs Magret as well, Mr Alec!
03/02/24, 9:42 am - Harmehak: Munashe recently became a part of the program as Keren must have already informed you.
03/02/24, 9:46 am - +263 77 305 8214: Sure, I was informed of Munashe's successful application. It is our wish that Keren also be successful in the Edoofa Program.
03/02/24, 9:55 am - Harmehak: We do look forward to the same!
03/02/24, 9:55 am - Harmehak: I would like to share an exciting news that, *We will be visiting Zimbabwe this month to prepare our Edoofians for the journey ahead and we look forward to you being a part of the mega seminar for aspirants.*
03/02/24, 10:00 am - +263 77 305 8214: That's great news. We hope to be part of the event. Thank you for sharing.
03/02/24, 10:00 am - Harmehak: You're very welcome please!
03/02/24, 10:01 am - Harmehak: Okay so in that case, I would like to ask you a few questions, but before that with immense pleasure, I would like to share the glimpses of the Africa Visit of our Founders which took place in June 2023! 

*It was a much-awaited event and they were welcomed by Ministries, Educationalists, Edoofians, and Parents across different African Countries. This is a must-watch video depicting the Acceptance of the Program in the African Continent, especially in Zimbabwe!!*
03/02/24, 10:01 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
03/02/24, 10:09 am - +263 77 305 8214: That's quite incredible. You guys are doing a very big job.
03/02/24, 10:10 am - Harmehak: I appreciate please!
03/02/24, 10:10 am - Harmehak: Okay so Keren, can you tell me:-

1. What is the name of the course which you would be studying through the Edoofa Program?

2. Through Edoofa in which country would you be pursuing your higher education?

3. What is the average cost for studies in that country without a scholarship?

4. What is the annual fee you will pay if found eligible for the program (yearly fee after Edoofa Scholarship)?

5. What is the enrollment fee of the Edoofa Program? 

6. If you are found eligible for the program in how many days you will have to pay the first part of your enrollment fee?

7. After receiving your provisional offer letter from the Edoofa Academic Board, you will have to pay your registration fee in order to finalise your university admission and reserve your scholarship seat. This registration fee will be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?
03/02/24, 10:31 am - +263 77 305 8214: Thank you Ms Harmehak.
1. I will be studying  Bachelor of Science in Medical Laboratory Technology

2. I will be pursuing my studies in India through Edoofa.

3. The average cost of the program in India without a Schoolarship is usd 6000 per annum.

4.The annual fee payable with a Schoolarship is Usd 2000-3000

5. The enrolment fee of Edoofa Program is Usd350

6. It is within 7 days that I will pay the first part of enrolment fee.

7. I think it's clear.

Thank you
03/02/24, 10:31 am - Harmehak: Thats very correct, Keren!
03/02/24, 10:32 am - Harmehak: However, do you recall that you can also aim for a *higher quantum of scholarship where the fee is $1200-1800*, Keren?
03/02/24, 10:35 am - +263 77 305 8214: Yes please,  that is what I aim to achieve
03/02/24, 10:37 am - Harmehak: Thats the spirit!
03/02/24, 10:37 am - Harmehak: Now you will have to appear for a test which is of 30 to 45 minutes, you can submit the test responses, by 01 PM.

*Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage.*
A fact that draws our attention is that, according to his position in life, an extravagant man is either admired or loathed. A successful business man does nothing to increase his popularity by being prudent with his money. A person who is wealthy is expected to lead a luxurious life and to be lavish with his hospitality. If he is not so, he is considered mean, and his reputation in business may even suffer in consequence. The paradox remains that he had not been careful with his money in the first place; he would never have achieved his present wealth.
Among the low income group, a different set of values exists. The young clerk, who makes his wife a present of a new dress when he has not paid his house rent, is condemned as extravagant. Carefulness with money to the point of meanness is applauded as a virtue. Nothing in his life is considered more worthy than paying his bills. The ideal wife for such a man separates her housekeeping money into joyless little piles – so much for rent, for food, for the children’s shoes, she is able to face the milkman with equanimity every, month satisfied with her economizing ways , and never knows the guilt of buying something she can’t really afford .
As for myself, I fall neither of these categories. If I have money to spare I can be extravagant, but when, as is usually the case, I am hard up and then I am the meanest man imaginable.

1. Which of the following would be the most appropriate title for the passage
a)The cause of poverty is extravagance.

Whey to Go Greek yogurt—a strained form of cultured yogurt—has grown enormously in popularity in the United States since it was first introduced in the country in the late 1980s. From 2011 to 2012 alone, sales of Greek yogurt in the US increased by 50 percent. The resulting increase in Greek yogurt production has forced those involved in the business to address the detrimental effects that the yogurt-making process may be having on the environment. Fortunately, farmers and others in the Greek yogurt business have found many methods of controlling and eliminating most environmental threats. Given these solutions as well as the many health benefits of the food, the advantages of Greek yogurt Q5. outdo the potential drawbacks of its production.Sentence [1] The main environmental problem caused by the production of Greek yogurt is the creation of acid whey as a by-product.Sentence [2] Because it requires up to four times more milk to make than conventional yogurt does, Greek yogurt produces larger amounts of acid whey, which is difficult to dispose of.Sentence [3] To address the problem of disposal, farmers have found a number of uses for acid whey. Sentence[4] They can add it to livestock feed as a protein Q.6. supplement, and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt.Sentence[5] If it is improperly introduced into the environment, acid-whey runoff Q.7. can pollute waterways, depleting the oxygen content of streams and rivers as it decomposes. Sentence [6] Yogurt manufacturers, food Q.8. scientists; and government officials are also working together to develop additional solutions for reusing whey.

TOPIC
Is it true that many Africans have poor diets because their farms are stagnant and ineffient?

Poor diet is of serious concern in many African countries. It is evidenced by many problems associated with poor diet and these include mulnutrition and hunger. Among other things, stagnant and inefficient farms is the main factor directly posing the diet challenges Africa. 

The African continent has vast land which either lie idle or underutilised. Inefficiency is seen and witnessed on many farms in African countries. These challenges always affect the African diet. 

Farming requires huge investment whether the farm is small or big. Huge capital is needed to start and maintain a farm. Hence it is therefore important for the financial institutions to support farmers as much as possible for African farming to be a success.  Most people owning farms are poor and can not afford upscaling of their activities. 

Cultivation needs machinery which are sometimes expensive. Certified seeds are also not affordable in some African Countries. Thus some farmers resort to uncertified seeds which in turn affect yields. Again, farming is labour intensive in the absence of machinery. The cost of meaningful labour is way high which makes many farmers to resort to subsistence farming and remain small. That again affect production of food crops and impacts on diet. 

Inefficiency again is caused by lack of morden technologies in farming. The old way of doing things affect farming. African Farmers need to embrace technology to improve productivity. There are new machines coming in and new methods of doing things and farmers need to invest in these things. 

In addition to that people need to embrace the Irrigation Technology. Most African countries are continously hit by drought due to climate change. Irrigation becomes an effective solution to this challenge. Farmers can harness rivers, dams and lakes which are always full and unutilised. African farms need irrigation. 

Again, value addition in agricultural production is of paramount importance. We need to have basic commodities as well as value added products. Innovative farming then becomes the answer to poor nutrition. 

Moreover, importation of scarce food product to supplement what Africa has got will help alleviate poor diet. For instance, importation of rice and other products from abroad is very high in Africa. 

Reinforcement of productive farming can also be supported by government policies. Again, funding of the Agricultural budget is important. 

In conclusion, I concur with the notion that many Africans have poor diets because their farms are stagnant and inefficient. However, the ideas provided in this essay will help improve African diet

My Inspirational story.

It was on a hot Wednesday afternoon in the middle of summer when I braved myself to rescue my two year old younger sister  Caroline from fire that gutted our round hut at our rural home. The whole family could not believe what happened that particular day. 

I was coming from school walking lackadaisically when I saw a thick cloud of smoke at a distant reaching the uttermost part of the clouds. The scene gripped my eyes and I could not believe that our home was on fire. 
Still in a shock, I heard a screeming voice of a baby and that frightened me and I was left with no little energy. What came into my mind is, my younger sister was in danger. 

I braved myself and felt some little energy and power and I swifty ran uphill towards our home. When I got closer I was perplexed by what I saw. The roof had almost fallen on the entrance of our hut trapping my younger sister who had fallen asleep and was alone at home. My mother had gone fetching water. I threw away my satchel, removed my school blazer and jumped through the fire into the hut. Glory to the Almighty for my younger sister had bundled herself behind the wardrobe and fire had not reached that area. 

It was smoke all over in the hut and I opened my eyes with difficulty to see my younger sister. I grabbed her into my arms and looked at the exit which was completely covered with red  fire flames. 

I held my breadth as I was facing the last hurddle. I closed my eyes for the last time and ran out through the firece flames. I could feel a tight grip of my younger sister's shivering hands who was now assured of her rescue. 

I came to a halt after a feel of blowing cool wind signalling we were away from danger. However, we had escaped with very minor injuries. 

Our mother arrived a few minutes later and could not believe what had happened. The fire had brought down our hut which left us without shelter.
The villagers assembled to help put out fire but it was to no avail. Fire had devoured everything and a helping had was needed from well wishers. 

 This is my inspirational story.
03/02/24, 2:55 pm - +263 77 305 8214: I think I am done Ms Harmehak. Kindly receive my assigment. Thank you
03/02/24, 2:57 pm - Harmehak: Alright Keren!

Received please, let me get it evaluated!
03/02/24, 2:57 pm - +263 77 305 8214: Well noted and thank you
03/02/24, 3:02 pm - Harmehak: You're welcome
03/02/24, 6:24 pm - Harmehak: Good Evening Keren,

Now, while I have submitted your test for evaluation, I have your interview slots, however before I shared the interview slots I would like you and your parents as well to answer a few of my questions.

So I wanted to ask that for the same, so could you and your parent be online for the next 20 minutes to answer my question?
03/02/24, 6:37 pm - +263 77 305 8214: Good evening Ms Harmehak. Well noted, you can go ahead we are ready.
03/02/24, 6:38 pm - Harmehak: Sure Mr Alec!

I believe you must have followed the entire discussion so far!

So now given the finances and the entire details of the program, I would like to know if you are willing to support Keren's higher education in India both mentally and financially please?

If so, kindly acknowledge using a voice note!
03/02/24, 6:42 pm - +263 77 305 8214: <Media omitted>
03/02/24, 6:43 pm - Harmehak: Well received please, you see as per my experience over the last couple of years, I have been fortunate to have assisted over hundreds of students in achieving their career aspiration through the Edoofa Program. 

One of my key observations during helping out these students was regarding what was the common trait amongst students who are today having the best of their time in India through the Edoofa Program, and honestly I was able to come down to only one aspect that is FAMILY SUPPORT.
03/02/24, 6:43 pm - Harmehak: You see in this journey of any child's higher education, there are three major contributors 

1. Student himself/herself
2. FAMILY
3. EDOOFA PROGAM

Now all the students who are today successfully a part of the Edoofa Program, had all these three contributors working together towards the common goal which is student's success and ensuring that by the time student completes his/her higher education they should be able to get good paying jobs. 

Even if any one of the contributor does not perform to the best of their abilities, Student's overall success is hampered. Let me give you a few examples

*In the event if student wishes to work hard, Edoofa is willing to support but the Family is not willing to support, the student will not be successful under the program*

*In the event if student wishes to work hard, Family is willing to support, but Edoofa's academic Board doesn't find the student worthy, the student will not be successful under the program*

*In the event if Family is willing to support, Edoofa's Academic Board is willing to support but the student doesn't wishes to work hard, then also the student will not be successful under the program*
03/02/24, 6:43 pm - Harmehak: During the evaluation of your child's application so far, the Academic Board has evaluated a few aspects, such as student's willingness to work hard, and family's willingness to support the student so that the student can achieve what he/she has aspired. However now in your interview ahead, the Academic Board would be strictly be evaluating the Family's support towards the child higher education. 

*As you know in the event if your child is found eligible, you would have to complete a certain part of the formalities within the 7 day timeline, so may I know regarding the same, are you willing to support your child to the fullest?*
03/02/24, 6:50 pm - +263 77 305 8214: As parents we can confirm we are willing to support Keren to the fullest. We are really prepared to walk this journey together with our daughter. Thank you
03/02/24, 6:51 pm - Harmehak: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
03/02/24, 6:51 pm - Harmehak: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
03/02/24, 6:51 pm - Harmehak: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.
03/02/24, 6:51 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
03/02/24, 6:51 pm - Harmehak: Ideally as you know, the tentative dates:

1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 11th or 12th February 2024 for $200 and the 11th or 12th of March for the remaining $150.

2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 11th or 12th February 2024. 

Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?
03/02/24, 6:59 pm - +263 77 305 8214: Thank you. We will opt for number 1 due to  flexibility. However, I should say we are prepared.
03/02/24, 7:03 pm - Harmehak: I do understand, Mr Alec and appreciate your acknowledgement!

The available slots for the interview with the Program Director for Monday are of 11:30 AM and 12 PM CAT.

Which slot shall I reserve for you and Keren, please?
03/02/24, 7:09 pm - +263 77 305 8214: I think 11:30 AM slot will be fine.
03/02/24, 7:10 pm - Harmehak: Surely Mr Alec, duly noted!

The interview has been scheduled for 11:30 AM CAT on Monday.
03/02/24, 7:14 pm - +263 77 305 8214: Well noted, will be ready for the interview.
 Thank you Ms Harmehak.
03/02/24, 7:15 pm - Harmehak: You're welcome, Mr Alec!

With this I wish you all a blessed weekend!
03/02/24, 7:18 pm - +263 77 305 8214: Thank you
