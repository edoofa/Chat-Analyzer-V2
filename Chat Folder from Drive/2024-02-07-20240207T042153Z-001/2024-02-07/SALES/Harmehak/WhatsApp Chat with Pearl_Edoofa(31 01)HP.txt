02/02/24, 11:51 am - +263 77 792 9699: Yes, I had that question in mind but I was self answering in this way maybe education in India is recognized locally and elsewhere.For example here in Zimbabwe we have people with good jobs who mention India as where they had acquired their higher level of education.Maybe we can also look at the quality of education which is offered in India.
02/02/24, 12:14 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate your efforts to research, Chituwu!
02/02/24, 12:14 pm - Harmehak: Alright please, let me add to it, you see over the past 6 years, the Edoofa Scholarship Program is only focused in India, because of the following reasons:

02/02/24, 12:48 pm - +263 77 792 9699: Wonderful! It's good that now I have enough information about India's education system.
02/02/24, 1:00 pm - Harmehak: I am glad this intrigued you and you found it helpful, Mr Chituwu!

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
02/02/24, 1:34 pm - +263 77 792 9699: Quite correct.We still need to find out if there is anyone in our family who is familiar with the cost.
02/02/24, 1:42 pm - Harmehak: I understand please!
02/02/24, 1:42 pm - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
02/02/24, 1:52 pm - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
02/02/24, 1:52 pm - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
02/02/24, 1:52 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
02/02/24, 2:15 pm - +263 77 792 9699: It is becoming clearer on that financial aspect we earlier talked about.So l now understand the EDOOFA program makes us being able to support our children financially through the reduction in the cost of education.
02/02/24, 2:33 pm - Harmehak: Yes please
02/02/24, 2:33 pm - Harmehak: In simple words Mr Chituwu, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
02/02/24, 2:34 pm - Harmehak: However as per my experience, I can share with you that *if she is able to perform and clear all these criteria with a high passing grade, she would be eligible for higher quantum of Scholarship*, in which you will just have to pay a minimal fee of *$1200-$1800*, Which would cover your entire fees be it food, accommodation, Tuition etc.
02/02/24, 2:50 pm - +263 77 792 9699: That's Interesting.Quite clear and well understood.
02/02/24, 3:02 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate!
02/02/24, 3:03 pm - Harmehak: What is your take on the finances, higher quantum of scholarship as well as the affordability, Mr Chituwu?
02/02/24, 3:13 pm - +263 77 792 9699: Higher quantum of schoarship is good and more affordable.
02/02/24, 3:13 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate.
02/02/24, 3:14 pm - Harmehak: Mr Chituwu, Senior Academician Mr Piyush were in Zimbabwe for about 90 days, from his experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,

While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time. 

This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year. 

Wouldn't you agree to the same?
02/02/24, 3:19 pm - +263 77 792 9699: I do agree.
02/02/24, 3:22 pm - Harmehak: So now after comparing the costs in Zimbabwe and India,

Are you now in a better position to relate how Edoofa is making higher education affordable and accessible for international students in India, Mr Chituwu?
02/02/24, 3:30 pm - +263 77 792 9699: After having revealed what it is like in India, lam now able to compare and appreciate the great work being done by EDOOFA.
02/02/24, 3:33 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

Now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program in detail and how it would assist you.
02/02/24, 3:33 pm - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
02/02/24, 3:33 pm - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
02/02/24, 3:33 pm - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

02/02/24, 3:53 pm - +263 77 792 9699: Well informed on the Earn while you learn program.
02/02/24, 3:58 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate please!
02/02/24, 3:58 pm - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $1800 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$600 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $50-$60 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
02/02/24, 4:25 pm - +263 77 792 9699: Alright, l understand.
02/02/24, 4:28 pm - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

02/02/24, 4:36 pm - +263 77 792 9699: Yes, l can.
02/02/24, 4:36 pm - Harmehak: That is great, 

So Chituwu now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes. 

Are you ready?
02/02/24, 4:39 pm - +263 77 792 9699: Yes, lam you can go ahead.
02/02/24, 4:44 pm - Harmehak: Mr Chituwu, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
02/02/24, 4:44 pm - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
02/02/24, 4:49 pm - +263 77 792 9699: Simple mathematics says $1500- $2250
02/02/24, 4:49 pm - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
02/02/24, 4:49 pm - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
02/02/24, 4:49 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
02/02/24, 5:00 pm - +263 77 792 9699: I understand.
02/02/24, 5:00 pm - Harmehak: Mr Chituwu, Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
02/02/24, 5:06 pm - +263 77 792 9699: Yes I do.
02/02/24, 5:06 pm - Harmehak: That's amazing, so now that you have understood how Edoofa makes the application process affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
02/02/24, 5:06 pm - Harmehak: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

Phase 3: Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.
02/02/24, 5:06 pm - Harmehak: *However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
02/02/24, 5:17 pm - +263 77 792 9699: That's right.
02/02/24, 5:17 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
02/02/24, 5:17 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
02/02/24, 5:17 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle.
02/02/24, 5:17 pm - Harmehak: Step 5: After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities. 

August 2025 intake, applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from the Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 instalments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.
02/02/24, 5:17 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
02/02/24, 5:31 pm - +263 77 792 9699: Well understood
02/02/24, 5:32 pm - Harmehak: Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.
02/02/24, 5:32 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
02/02/24, 5:57 pm - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
02/02/24, 5:57 pm - Harmehak: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)
02/02/24, 6:04 pm - +263 77 792 9699: I will find time to communicate with her to find out how she is making ends meet.
02/02/24, 6:05 pm - Harmehak: Sure please, Mr Chituwu!
02/02/24, 6:05 pm - Harmehak: Do go through the video that I shared earlier!
02/02/24, 6:07 pm - +263 77 792 9699: Alright I will go through it.
02/02/24, 6:08 pm - Harmehak: Sure please!
02/02/24, 6:29 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
02/02/24, 6:29 pm - Harmehak: These are Mrs Ruth's daughters.
02/02/24, 6:33 pm - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
02/02/24, 6:33 pm - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
02/02/24, 6:33 pm - Harmehak: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

02/02/24, 6:34 pm - Harmehak: Dear Parents and Pearl,

Your scholarship journey is reaching a crucial juncture. *Tomorrow on “03-02-23” at 9 A.M. CAT,* I will meticulously evaluate your application. This session is not just about answering your questions; it includes a vital Eligibility Check Interview.

We strongly recommend parents/guardians join, recognizing that higher education is a family decision. Prepare for a series of interviews, marking a significant phase in finalizing your scholarship application. As your counselor, I wish you the very best. It's been a pleasure guiding you through your career sessions.

If you qualify for the interview, we would proceed ahead and we look forward to welcoming you to India. Please be proactive, as everyone's time is valuable. The Senior Counselor and Director will make decisions based on your interview and adhere strictly to the given time. Follow instructions diligently, and if the session is completed within the allotted time, your application will proceed.

Happy Family Discussion!
Stay Blessed!
03/02/24, 8:57 am - Harmehak: Good Morning Everyone, Hope you are doing well.

I believe you must have discussed all the above mentioned points with your family?

I am here to address any questions if they have any.

Are we good to proceed with your application now?
03/02/24, 10:14 am - Harmehak: I would like to share an exciting news that, *We will be visiting Zimbabwe this month to prepare our Edoofians for the journey ahead and we look forward to you being a part of the mega seminar for aspirants.*
03/02/24, 7:49 pm - Harmehak: I was expecting your response, now I would be scheduling your session for *Monday at 9:30 AM CAT*, as my working hours for the day are over and it's already been a long day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.
05/02/24, 9:35 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
05/02/24, 5:48 pm - Harmehak: Pearl and Mr Chituwu, I can see you have been going through the messages and not getting back.

May I know what challenges are you facing currently?
05/02/24, 5:50 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
06/02/24, 9:32 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start?
06/02/24, 10:09 am - +263 77 381 4731: Mrng Ms Harmehak .you said there is a fee which we should pay right.is it needed now or next year
06/02/24, 10:16 am - Harmehak: Which fee are you referring to Pearl?
06/02/24, 10:18 am - +263 77 381 4731: Registration fee
06/02/24, 10:30 am - Harmehak: Did you go through the same?
06/02/24, 5:10 pm - +263 77 381 4731: So how many points are required
06/02/24, 6:00 pm - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!
06/02/24, 9:16 pm - Harmehak: The enrollment fee is paid if/after you are found eligible for the program and you receive an acceptance letter.
