I am Ms.Harmehak, Career Counselor at Edoofa.

I am here to evaluate Albert T Chamokoto's application for the Edoofa Program. 

Shall we start?
01/02/24, 9:40 am - +263 78 885 6388: Good morning 
We can start
01/02/24, 9:42 am - Harmehak: It is a pleasure to connect with you today, 

You can address me as *Ms. Harmehak and we do have with us, Mr. Piyush who is the Head of Counseling and Mr. Jyotishman who is the Head of Admissions* and will be evaluating your responses for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
01/02/24, 9:45 am - +263 78 885 6388: Okay nice to meet you Ms Harmehak
01/02/24, 9:47 am - Harmehak: *Alright so Albert, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.*

I would like to know you better as a student so please go ahead, tell me a bit about yourself, your education, along with what do you wish to study, your strengths and weaknesses, and your hobbies, since I honestly don't know a lot about you?

And with that a detailed description of your family background, what do your parents do *(Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work)?*, what is their highest education level along with if you have any siblings, please?
01/02/24, 9:59 am - +263 78 885 6388: I just finished my A level studies.I was doing Mathematics, Physics and Chemistry.I managed to have 11points.
In my everyday life I wish to study Energy and Fuels Engineering 
Mostly on my free time I like to play chess and Darts 
Due to our economic situation in Zimbabwe my parents are in South Africa, my father is a proshade tailor and my mother works as a cleaner on one of the company houses 
My sister is fashion Designer.
01/02/24, 10:01 am - Harmehak: Well received and well expressed Albert, Its a pleasure to know about you and your family!

I appreciate the honesty and transparency you have shown in expressing yourself!

I appreciate your parent's efforts to provide well for the family.
01/02/24, 10:01 am - +263 78 885 6388: You're welcome Ms
01/02/24, 10:02 am - +263 78 885 6388: I would be grateful if you help me in any means
01/02/24, 10:11 am - Harmehak: I understand, Albert!
01/02/24, 10:11 am - Harmehak: Well Albert, now as we proceed ahead, I would like to your thoughts on higher education abroad!

Do you believe it's a life changing decision?
01/02/24, 10:14 am - +263 78 885 6388: Yes it's life changing decision because if we check most of the universities in Zimbabwe do not have the equipment for practicals as compared to abroad
01/02/24, 10:20 am - Harmehak: You see, Albert, Senior Academician Mr. Piyush was in Zimbabwe for about 90 days. He had the privilege of meeting many Zimbabwean students who had applied for the Edoofa Program back in 2018-2019. However, at that time, they didn't proceed because they were enticed by the prospect of earning quick money in the country. This year, when they met him, they shared how difficult things have been for them. Some of them, despite holding reputed degrees from UZ, MSU, and HIT, are working as petrol attendants, while others have started careers as mobile/laptop repair technicians. Some were facing even more challenges, resorting to selling Ecocash, Simcards, or vegetables.

Observing this scenario, Mr. Piyush saw many of them regretting not seizing the opportunity when they had the chance. So, what you are sharing, I can understand that, in reality, things are much more challenging over there.
01/02/24, 10:26 am - +263 78 885 6388: Cause its useless to spend 5 years studying in Zimbabwe to be an engineer and afterwards you will be selling ecocash
01/02/24, 10:27 am - Harmehak: I do understand and I am glad you are making efforts for a promising future!
01/02/24, 10:28 am - Harmehak: So would you add that you are mentally prepared for a life abroad too, Albert?
01/02/24, 10:28 am - +263 78 885 6388: Yes I'm prepared
01/02/24, 10:36 am - Harmehak: Albert, I am delighted to see your dedication and I believe you would agree with me that commitment from your parents is equally important!

So now could you please share, if your family members are aware of your plans to study abroad and if they are willing to support your higher education abroad mentally and financially?
01/02/24, 10:39 am - +263 78 885 6388: Yes they are aware on my plans 
But I don't know on their budget so far that's why I was looking for a fully funded scholarship
01/02/24, 11:11 am - Harmehak: I understand!

May I know your understanding of a fully funded scholarship, Albert?
01/02/24, 11:12 am - +263 78 885 6388: I know a little about it, can you help me understand it <This message was edited>
01/02/24, 11:39 am - Harmehak: You can share your understanding, Albert!
01/02/24, 12:10 pm - +263 78 885 6388: I think it is a scholarship that provide enough money to cover full cost of attendance including tuition fee and other associated expenses
01/02/24, 12:32 pm - Harmehak: Actually you are mistaken over here, let me explain to you that there are two kinds of programs that provide assistance to the students because a lot of times parents and students themselves misunderstand what a Scholarship actually means.

*1. Scholarships*
*2. Sponsorships*

Scholarships make education *affordable* for the students by reducing their *Tuition Fees*, now a lot of times parents and students consider that a Domestic Scholarship would be the same as an International Scholarship, but to understand the difference between them, consider yourself applying for an education in your own country with the help of a scholarship. Now after the scholarship when your tuition fee would be reduced, eventually your entire cost of education would be reduced because being a citizen of the country, you wouldn't be required to spend any fees on Accommodation and feeding separately since in that case, students would be staying with their families. However, if I personally plan to study in Zimbabwe with the same scholarship, I would have to incur some costs on Accommodation and Feeding because I am not a Zimbabwean Citizen. So a lot of times parents and students consider International Scholarship and Domestic Scholarship one and the same thing, but in reality, they aren't.

Sponsorships, on the other hand, take care entirely of a student's education, but because Sponsorships are provided by only a few organizations, there are a lot of terms and conditions which a student might need to follow in order to get the sponsorship, the most common term is that a student after completion of the course would have to work for the organization providing the sponsorship for a period of time.
01/02/24, 12:34 pm - +263 78 885 6388: Okay thank you for the explanation
01/02/24, 12:42 pm - Harmehak: I believe now you have a better clarity, Albert?
01/02/24, 12:43 pm - +263 78 885 6388: Yes it's now clear
01/02/24, 12:57 pm - Harmehak: That's good,

So far, would you like to ask anything?
01/02/24, 1:00 pm - +263 78 885 6388: Nothing more 
I'll be waiting on you to take me through the procedures of applying
01/02/24, 1:14 pm - Harmehak: So are your parents willing to support your higher education financially, Albert?
01/02/24, 2:56 pm - +263 78 885 6388: Yes they are
01/02/24, 3:01 pm - Harmehak: Duly noted, Albert!
01/02/24, 3:03 pm - Harmehak: Who would be the one supporting you financially, Albert?
01/02/24, 3:04 pm - +263 78 885 6388: My parents and sister
01/02/24, 3:25 pm - Harmehak: Alright please, I do appreciate their combined efforts!
01/02/24, 3:25 pm - Harmehak: Kindly share your O and A level results please!
01/02/24, 3:28 pm - +263 78 885 6388: <Media omitted>
01/02/24, 3:28 pm - +263 78 885 6388: <Media omitted>
01/02/24, 3:29 pm - Harmehak: Well received!

So what motivates you to study in your desired field Albert?
01/02/24, 3:47 pm - +263 78 885 6388: Firstly as a youth I saw it important to study energy and Fuels engineering because its a life changing program for the nation 
As in Zimbabwe we are importing most of our Fuels which will affect us economically therefore as student if I qualify to have this program I'll help my country in any way possible so as to reduce the costs of Fuels 
On the other hand  some of the Fuels being used in Zimbabwe are a danger to the ecosystem whereas in the department of energy and Fuels we deal with the  use of sustainable environmental friendly fuels  thereby saving the Globe
01/02/24, 3:54 pm - Harmehak: I completely understand what you are sharing and appreciate your efforts for the environment too!
01/02/24, 3:54 pm - Harmehak: So what all did you research regarding the field, Albert?
01/02/24, 4:04 pm - +263 78 885 6388: Energy engineering is a broad field of engineering dealing with areas such as energy harvesting and storage, energy conversion, energy materials, energy systems, energy efficiency, energy services, facility management, plant engineering, energy modelling, environmental compliance, sustainable energy and renewable ...

My aim as an energy engineer develop solutions for improving energy consumption and use. Through research, design, documentation, and construction they implement green solutions, cutting down environmental impact and cost. Careers in energy engineering include those in wind and solar energy.
01/02/24, 7:29 pm - Harmehak: I would have loved to continue, however I would be scheduling your session for *tomorrow at 9:30 AM CAT*, as my working hours for the day are over and it's already been a long day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
01/02/24, 7:30 pm - +263 78 885 6388: Okay thank you Ms <This message was edited>
01/02/24, 7:41 pm - Harmehak: Do go through the shared video to learn more about the experience of our Proud Edoofians!
01/02/24, 7:41 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
01/02/24, 8:03 pm - +263 78 885 6388: Okay thank you
02/02/24, 9:32 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
02/02/24, 9:35 am - +263 78 885 6388: Good morning Ms 
I'm ready we can start
02/02/24, 9:47 am - Harmehak: Were you able to go through the shared video, Albert?
02/02/24, 9:51 am - +263 78 885 6388: Yes thank you 
My mind was opened and I now have a better view about studying abroad
02/02/24, 9:58 am - Harmehak: That's great!

Did your parents happen to follow our discussion, Albert?
02/02/24, 9:59 am - +263 78 885 6388: Yes they went through it yesterday after work
02/02/24, 10:05 am - Harmehak: That's wonderful!

So far, would they like to ask anything?
02/02/24, 10:06 am - +263 78 885 6388: Nothing yet
02/02/24, 10:32 am - Harmehak: Alright Albert!
02/02/24, 10:32 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
02/02/24, 10:59 am - +263 78 885 6388: Okay thanks I'll be waiting on you
02/02/24, 11:23 am - Harmehak: Sure please!
02/02/24, 11:23 am - Harmehak: What you are sharing is completely right because of which if you observe, in most of the world today electric cars, and electrically operated vehicles and machinery are being produced at a much higher quantum, isn't it?
02/02/24, 11:24 am - +263 78 885 6388: Yes this Fuel thing will be phased out soon
02/02/24, 11:35 am - Harmehak: Yes please!
02/02/24, 11:36 am - Harmehak: However, If I may ask Albert, what makes you think so please?
02/02/24, 11:52 am - +263 78 885 6388: Because these fossil Fuels are not a renewable energy sources so they will run out 
On the other side as you once said most of the industrial machines are electrically powered which is reducing the use of fuel in  the industry sector, this can lead to phasing out of fuel since most of the fuel was being used at industries
02/02/24, 12:30 pm - Harmehak: That is right Albert, so moving forward don't you think something that you would study as a part of your tertiary education should have a viability of atleast 40+ years?
02/02/24, 2:08 pm - +263 78 885 6388: Yes it should be applicable for a long term <This message was edited>
02/02/24, 2:44 pm - Harmehak: So looking at the same, if I may ask, did you happen to research more about alternative engineering fields as well please?
02/02/24, 2:46 pm - +263 78 885 6388: Yes I researched about mining, civil and Electrical engineering
02/02/24, 2:48 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

What all did you learn regarding the fields?
02/02/24, 2:53 pm - +263 78 885 6388: Civil engineering it is the branch of engineering concerned with the design and construction of such public works as dams or bridges
Where as Electrical engineering it is the branch of engineering science that studies the uses of electricity and the equipment for power generation and distribution and the control of machines and communication
02/02/24, 2:56 pm - Harmehak: Well put across, Albert.

I can see you managed to research well!
02/02/24, 2:56 pm - Harmehak: That is interesting, so if I may ask, which field out of these three fields do you think has the most growth potential in the next 5 to 7 years please?
02/02/24, 3:08 pm - +263 78 885 6388: Electrical because if we check in the mining field minerals will exhaust, and also in the civil engineering most of the designing of infrastructure will be done by automated machines
02/02/24, 3:11 pm - Harmehak: I am glad that you do have thorough knowledge, Albert.

So now shall I brief you about Bachelors of Technology in Electrical Engineering?
02/02/24, 3:11 pm - +263 78 885 6388: Yes you can Ms
02/02/24, 3:17 pm - Harmehak: *Bachelor of Technology in Electrical Engineering* is a 4 years degree course. Electrical engineering is one of the most sought-after branches of engineering

Electrical engineering is the study and application of electricity, electronics and electromagnetism for the development and maintenance of electrical and electronics equipment. Electrical Engineering course study includes Circuit analysis, machines & drive system, Power System, Control system, Power electronics, Utilization etc. The main focus of the course will be on industrial requirement of ‘Electrical engineering’.

The scope for students of B. Tech Electrical Engineering is very high. There are two options available for them either they can join higher education after this course or they can join their professional career as per skills. At present, electrical engineers have great demand in the market.
 
An objective of this course is to ensure the success of the students for a long time. Students can develop their electrical skills and abilities with the study of this course. They also can improve abilities of professional attitude, effective communication skills as well.

02/02/24, 3:19 pm - +263 78 885 6388: Okay thank you for opening my mind about Electrical engineering 
I'm now getting it
02/02/24, 3:24 pm - Harmehak: That's great, Albert
02/02/24, 3:25 pm - Harmehak: Albert, as you must be aware that Lenon from your school is already a part of the Edoofa program,

I would like to share with you that he would also be pursuing Bachelors of Technology in Electrical Engineering here in India!

You can connect with him to learn regarding his thoughts along with his journey and application so far, Albert!
02/02/24, 3:26 pm - +263 78 885 6388: Okay let me get in touch with him
02/02/24, 3:26 pm - Harmehak: Sure please
02/02/24, 3:27 pm - Harmehak: Alright so Albert, since you have understood the course, can you please tell me, if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself in 5 years and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
02/02/24, 3:39 pm - +263 78 885 6388: If I'm provided with this career option, I'll be someone able to apply his knowledge into the real world. On the other side I'll be an everyday ambassador of the Edoofa program since it had helped me in choosing a better program that is applicable in many fields
02/02/24, 3:41 pm - Harmehak: That is really great Albert, I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations!

Now, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
02/02/24, 3:47 pm - +263 78 885 6388: As studying compared to Zimbabwe studying abroad is a better choice because you will be exposed to a world where engineering equipment is available for students to their practicals ,also gain a global perspective-while earning credits towards your degree. It will allow you to develop highly-valued skills such as intercultural communication, foreign languages, adaptability, and problem-solving.
02/02/24, 3:48 pm - Harmehak: That is wonderful Albert, I can see you are aiming at maximum exposure.

Now as you know Edoofa Recommends India as a Higher Education destination.

*May I know what is your knowledge or what have you researched about India and Indian Education System which makes you feel that studying in India would help you achieve your dreams?*
02/02/24, 3:53 pm - +263 78 885 6388: I found out that most of the world ranked engineers are from India and also the degree from India is world recognised 
And also the Indian education system provides early exposure to various career options and opportunities. Schools offer career guidance programs, workshops, and counseling sessions to help students explore their interests, strengths, and make informed career
02/02/24, 3:54 pm - Harmehak: That's wonderful, Albert!

I am glad you did research.
02/02/24, 3:54 pm - Harmehak: Alright please, let me add to it, you see over the past 6 years, the Edoofa Scholarship Program is only focused in India, because of the following reasons:

02/02/24, 3:58 pm - +263 78 885 6388: Okay thank you for the additional knowledge actually didn't know that
02/02/24, 3:58 pm - Harmehak: I am glad this intrigued you and you found it helpful, Albert!

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
02/02/24, 3:59 pm - +263 78 885 6388: No we haven't researched
02/02/24, 4:01 pm - Harmehak: Alright please!
02/02/24, 4:01 pm - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
02/02/24, 4:03 pm - +263 78 885 6388: Mmmn didn't know
02/02/24, 4:03 pm - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
02/02/24, 4:03 pm - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
02/02/24, 4:03 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
02/02/24, 4:05 pm - +263 78 885 6388: That will be much better
02/02/24, 4:09 pm - Harmehak: In simple words Albert, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
02/02/24, 4:09 pm - Harmehak: However as per my experience, I can share with you that *if you are able to perform and clear all these criteria with a high passing grade, you would be eligible for higher quantum of Scholarship*, in which you will just have to pay a minimal fee of *$1600-$2300*, Which would cover your entire fees be it food, accommodation, Tuition etc.

What are your thoughts on the same?
02/02/24, 4:14 pm - +263 78 885 6388: Okay that's being grateful
02/02/24, 4:16 pm - Harmehak: Albert, from Mr Piyush's experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,

While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time. 

This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year. 

Wouldn't you agree to the same?
02/02/24, 4:17 pm - +263 78 885 6388: Yes that's true
02/02/24, 4:19 pm - Harmehak: So now, are you in a better position to relate how Edoofa is making higher education affordable and accessible for international students in India, Albert?
02/02/24, 4:19 pm - +263 78 885 6388: Yes I'm now understanding the help you are doing
02/02/24, 4:23 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

Now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program in detail and how it would assist you.
02/02/24, 4:23 pm - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
02/02/24, 4:23 pm - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
02/02/24, 4:23 pm - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

02/02/24, 4:27 pm - +263 78 885 6388: That's great
02/02/24, 4:29 pm - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $1800 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$600 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $50-$60 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
02/02/24, 4:31 pm - +263 78 885 6388: I'm understanding now
02/02/24, 4:32 pm - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

02/02/24, 4:34 pm - +263 78 885 6388: Yes I'm getting it
02/02/24, 4:34 pm - Harmehak: Did you thoroughly follow all the shared resources and information, Albert?
02/02/24, 4:36 pm - +263 78 885 6388: Yes I did
02/02/24, 4:36 pm - Harmehak: That is great, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes. 

Are you ready?
02/02/24, 4:37 pm - +263 78 885 6388: Yes I'm ready
02/02/24, 4:43 pm - Harmehak: Albert, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
02/02/24, 4:43 pm - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
02/02/24, 4:45 pm - +263 78 885 6388: That will be expensive sure $1500-$2250
02/02/24, 4:47 pm - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
02/02/24, 4:47 pm - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
02/02/24, 4:47 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
02/02/24, 4:50 pm - +263 78 885 6388: That's being genuine 
We thank you for that
02/02/24, 4:50 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate, Albert!

Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
02/02/24, 4:52 pm - +263 78 885 6388: Yes it is doing a great job
02/02/24, 4:53 pm - Harmehak: That's amazing, so now that you have understood how Edoofa makes the application process affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
02/02/24, 4:53 pm - Harmehak: Now as you can see, because of such an amazing opportunity that Edoofa provides to its students, Edoofa receives thousands of applications on a  daily basis out of which Eligibility Evaluation takes place as I did share with you above, so only if the student is found eligible for the program and get their Acceptance Letter, *they will have to pay the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Acceptance Letter after which they start with their admission process and the Earn While You Learn Program.*
02/02/24, 4:53 pm - Harmehak: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
02/02/24, 4:55 pm - +263 78 885 6388: Ooow that's good
02/02/24, 4:56 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate!
02/02/24, 4:56 pm - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
02/02/24, 4:56 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
02/02/24, 4:56 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in their country itself.
02/02/24, 4:56 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
02/02/24, 4:58 pm - +263 78 885 6388: Yes I did thank you
02/02/24, 4:58 pm - Harmehak: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
02/02/24, 4:58 pm - Harmehak: Basically, this registration fee ($500-$1000) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024-2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
02/02/24, 4:58 pm - Harmehak: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*

Here is a picture of the Visa of one of the Edoofian who arrived in India, for 2023 Academic Intake.

02/02/24, 5:01 pm - +263 78 885 6388: I'm getting it
02/02/24, 5:01 pm - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
02/02/24, 5:01 pm - Harmehak: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)

02/02/24, 5:05 pm - +263 78 885 6388: Noted let me get into touch with her
02/02/24, 5:05 pm - Harmehak: Sure please!

Do request your parents to connect as well, Albert.
02/02/24, 5:07 pm - +263 78 885 6388: Sorry 
They are still at work now
02/02/24, 5:09 pm - Harmehak: I understand,

They can get in touch after work itself.
02/02/24, 5:11 pm - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
02/02/24, 5:11 pm - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
02/02/24, 5:11 pm - Harmehak: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

03/02/24, 9:08 am - Harmehak: I am glad to know that!

What all would you or they like to ask?

03/02/24, 9:12 am - Harmehak: Yes please, during the admissions process, you would receive multiple applications from universities where your application would have qualified for, after the same you would discuss the same as a family and which university you would like to finalise!
03/02/24, 10:14 am - Harmehak: I would like to share an exciting news that, *We will be visiting Zimbabwe this month to prepare our Edoofians for the journey ahead and we look forward to you being a part of the mega seminar for aspirants.*
03/02/24, 10:41 am - +263 78 885 6388: That's good then
03/02/24, 10:41 am - +263 78 885 6388: That's great news Ms
03/02/24, 10:42 am - Harmehak: I appreciate, Albert!
03/02/24, 10:43 am - Harmehak: Have you already had the opportunity to connect with Mrs. Ruth? 

You see, her story is truly remarkable. As a single parent, juggling the responsibilities of a small-scale farmer and the mother of two daughters, she has persevered. Her journey with Edoofa is a testament to how dedicated individuals can overcome obstacles.
Mrs. Ruth's experience with Edoofa is a testament to the transformative impact our programs can have. She not only managed her family's needs but also seized the opportunity for her daughters to achieve higher education. The support and guidance she received from Edoofa were instrumental in her success. The process was challenging, yet incredibly rewarding. Mrs. Ruth's determination, combined with Edoofa's assistance, has paved the way for a brighter future.
03/02/24, 10:44 am - +263 78 885 6388: Yes I connected with her yesterday
03/02/24, 10:45 am - Harmehak: Thats good!
03/02/24, 10:45 am - Harmehak: Okay so in that case, I would like to ask you a few questions, but before that with immense pleasure, I would like to share the glimpses of the Africa Visit of our Founders which took place in June 2023! 

*It was a much-awaited event and they were welcomed by Ministries, Educationalists, Edoofians, and Parents across different African Countries. This is a must-watch video depicting the Acceptance of the Program in the African Continent, especially in Zimbabwe!!*

03/02/24, 11:10 am - Harmehak: Okay so Albert, can you tell me:-

1. What is the name of the course which you would be studying through the Edoofa Program?

2. Through Edoofa in which country would you be pursuing your higher education?

3. What is the average cost for studies in that country without a scholarship?

4. What is the annual fee you will pay if found eligible for the program (yearly fee after Edoofa Scholarship)?

5. What is the enrollment fee of the Edoofa Program? 

6. If you are found eligible for the program in how many days you will have to pay the first part of your enrollment fee?

7. After receiving your offer letter from the Edoofa Academic Board, you will have to pay your registration fee in order to finalise your university admission and reserve your scholarship seat. This registration fee will be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?
03/02/24, 11:15 am - +263 78 885 6388: 1. Electrical engineering

*Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage.*
A fact that draws our attention is that, according to his position in life, an extravagant man is either admired or loathed. A successful business man does nothing to increase his popularity by being prudent with his money. A person who is wealthy is expected to lead a luxurious life and to be lavish with his hospitality. If he is not so, he is considered mean, and his reputation in business may even suffer in consequence. The paradox remains that he had not been careful with his money in the first place; he would never have achieved his present wealth.
Among the low income group, a different set of values exists. The young clerk, who makes his wife a present of a new dress when he has not paid his house rent, is condemned as extravagant. Carefulness with money to the point of meanness is applauded as a virtue. Nothing in his life is considered more worthy than paying his bills. The ideal wife for such a man separates her housekeeping money into joyless little piles – so much for rent, for food, for the children’s shoes, she is able to face the milkman with equanimity every, month satisfied with her economizing ways , and never knows the guilt of buying something she can’t really afford .
As for myself, I fall neither of these categories. If I have money to spare I can be extravagant, but when, as is usually the case, I am hard up and then I am the meanest man imaginable.

1. Which of the following would be the most appropriate title for the passage
a)The cause of poverty is extravagance.
b)Stingy habits of the poor.
c)Being extravagant is always condemnable.
d)Extravagance is a part of the rich as well as of the poor.

2.According to the passage the person, who is a successful businessman and wealthy
a)Is more popular if he appears to be wasting away his time.
b)Is expected to have lavish lifestyle.
c)Must be extravagant before achieving success.
d)Should not bother about popularity.

3. The phrase ‘lavish with his hospitality’ in the third sentence of the first paragraph means
a)Extravagance in entertaining guest.
b)Unconcerned in treating his friends and relatives.
c)Thoughtful in spending only on guests and strangers.
d)Stinginess in dealing with his relatives.

4.The word ‘paradox’ in the last sentence of the first paragraph means
a)A word that brings out the hidden meaning
b)Statement based on facts
c)a statement that seems self-contradictory but in reality expresses a possible truth.
d)Statement based on the popular opinion

5.What is the meaning of the word “equanimity”?
a)Calmness
b)Discomposure

Whey to Go Greek yogurt—a strained form of cultured yogurt—has grown enormously in popularity in the United States since it was first introduced in the country in the late 1980s. From 2011 to 2012 alone, sales of Greek yogurt in the US increased by 50 percent. The resulting increase in Greek yogurt production has forced those involved in the business to address the detrimental effects that the yogurt-making process may be having on the environment. Fortunately, farmers and others in the Greek yogurt business have found many methods of controlling and eliminating most environmental threats. Given these solutions as well as the many health benefits of the food, the advantages of Greek yogurt Q5. outdo the potential drawbacks of its production.Sentence [1] The main environmental problem caused by the production of Greek yogurt is the creation of acid whey as a by-product.Sentence [2] Because it requires up to four times more milk to make than conventional yogurt does, Greek yogurt produces larger amounts of acid whey, which is difficult to dispose of.Sentence [3] To address the problem of disposal, farmers have found a number of uses for acid whey. Sentence[4] They can add it to livestock feed as a protein Q.6. supplement, and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt.Sentence[5] If it is improperly introduced into the environment, acid-whey runoff Q.7. can pollute waterways, depleting the oxygen content of streams and rivers as it decomposes. Sentence [6] Yogurt manufacturers, food Q.8. scientists; and government officials are also working together to develop additional solutions for reusing whey.

6.supplement, and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt.
A) NO CHANGE
B) supplement and convert it into gas to use as fuel in electricity production.

Based on my view its not always the farmers to be blamed because Africa is facing a lot of agricultural challenges for example, Africa's food security is compounded by the war in Ukraine, by supply chain shortages and some civil conflicts in between the country.Also African government have a low commitment to spending on agriculture especially on the extension services. We need to prioritise food systems transformation, how food is produced, traded and consumed.

Secondly if we check at the horn of Africa, strong droughts affect them, locust,storms destroying crops and also internal conflicts in Ethopia
Also the farming  is affected by  climate change ,Climate change leads to yield reduction ,change in rainfall patterns.For instance farmers in Nigeria have seen lower yields caused by new pests disease outbreaks and the drying up of rivers 
Therefore we can not put the blame on the farmers only

They saw a lot of kids going to school some of them were bare footed and some did not have enough complete uniforms. One of them stopped a group of kids and asked them the name of their school and their family backgrounds , a young boy replied in a polite manner that amazed the whole members of the organisation. Weeks passed and the Organisation went back to their country. After two months they came back with three big lorries full of school stationeries to donate for the school <This message was edited>
