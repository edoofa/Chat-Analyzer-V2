23/01/24, 7:21 pm - Harmehak: You're very welcome!

24/01/24, 9:42 am - Harmehak: I appreciate, Natalie!
24/01/24, 9:43 am - Harmehak: So as of now may I know which field would you like to opt for please?
24/01/24, 9:43 am - +263 71 293 5302: Social work
24/01/24, 9:44 am - Harmehak: Duly noted,

Now let me brief you about the same.
24/01/24, 9:44 am - +263 71 293 5302: Okay
24/01/24, 9:44 am - Harmehak: Now let me help you have a better understanding, social work is a great course at the current time. From my personal experience of being in the field of education, I see many students apply for the course, but being a very niche course, a lot of universities don't offer the same because the cost of the course is very high and since it's a practical course, and the ones who do they don't offer scholarships on the course as the investment to teach such a course to a number of students becomes very high for the university as well. 

Now usually what students do is, that they pursue a course that is similar to this particular course. A student can do all the related jobs without a degree of social work. A lot of time students pursue a course called Bachelor of Sociology. The base of this course and the base of social work as a course in similar in nature which is why students who pursue this course end up having career opportunities in the field of social work!
24/01/24, 9:44 am - Harmehak: Social work and sociology have many similarities when it comes to career aspirations. For both professions, the main goal is to work with individuals, families, and communities to improve the quality of life and promote positive change. Both social work and sociology focus on understanding the causes of social problems and developing strategies to address them.

Social workers and sociologists use similar skills and approaches to help people, including interviewing, counseling, advocating, and providing support and resources. They also draw on research methods and theories to inform their practice and shape their interventions. For example, sociologists may conduct research on a particular population to gain a better understanding of how their environment, culture, and other factors influence their behavior and quality of life. This knowledge can then be applied to the development of social policy and change initiatives.

Both social workers and sociologists also strive to create a more equitable and just society. They recognize the importance of understanding and appreciating diversity, as well as the need to challenge oppression, discrimination, and social injustice. They work together to create an environment that values and respects all people, regardless of race, gender, class, or other factors.

Overall, social work and sociology have similar goals and approaches to promoting positive change. They both recognize the importance of understanding the root causes of social problems and developing strategies to address them. They also strive to create a more equitable and just society by challenging oppression, discrimination, and social injustice.
24/01/24, 9:44 am - Harmehak: You can go through the same and inform me please
24/01/24, 9:47 am - +263 71 293 5302: I did thank you
24/01/24, 9:57 am - Harmehak: You're very welcome

So what is your understanding, Natalie?
24/01/24, 9:59 am - +263 71 293 5302: I understand that social workers and sociology have same goal of promoting posituve changes and they both understamds the causes of social problems and skills to solve them
24/01/24, 10:09 am - Harmehak: Very correct, 

So now shall I brief you about Bachelors in Sociology?
24/01/24, 10:09 am - +263 71 293 5302: yes
24/01/24, 10:15 am - Harmehak: *B.A. (Hons.) in Sociology* is an undergraduate program that deals with various aspects of social behavior and its consequence on modern society.

24/01/24, 10:19 am - +263 71 293 5302: I understand
24/01/24, 10:35 am - Harmehak: So far, do you have any queries, Natalie?
24/01/24, 10:38 am - +263 71 293 5302: No
24/01/24, 10:45 am - Harmehak: So would you like to pursue the same?
24/01/24, 10:46 am - +263 71 293 5302: I want social work but if there are no places for social work l will go for that one
24/01/24, 10:47 am - Harmehak: While I do understand,

As I was briefing you earlier here in India, students who wish to pursue Social work they pursue Sociology itself as the courses are similar here.
24/01/24, 10:57 am - +263 71 293 5302: Okay l can go for that one
24/01/24, 11:12 am - Harmehak: Alright Natalie, since you have understood the course, can you please tell me, if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself in 5 years and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
24/01/24, 11:16 am - +263 71 293 5302: I see myself a good sociologist and that is my dream to be a good one .If l get into Edoofa's Program it can help me achieve my dreams by paying my fees and l will not be to quit school because l will having the EWYL program which is provided by Edoofa
24/01/24, 11:41 am - Harmehak: That is really great Natalie, I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations!

Now, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
24/01/24, 11:46 am - +263 71 293 5302: I want to study abroad not in my country cz abroad gives us better education and they are affordable rather than in my country
24/01/24, 11:58 am - Harmehak: You see, Natalie, Senior Academician Mr. Piyush was in Zimbabwe for about 90 days. He had the privilege of meeting many Zimbabwean students who had applied for the Edoofa Program back in 2018-2019. However, at that time, they didn't proceed because they were enticed by the prospect of earning quick money in the country. This year, when they met him, they shared how difficult things have been for them. Some of them, despite holding reputed degrees from UZ, MSU, and HIT, are working as petrol attendants, while others have started careers as mobile/laptop repair technicians. Some were facing even more challenges, resorting to selling Ecocash, Simcards, or vegetables.

Observing this scenario, Mr. Piyush saw many of them regretting not seizing the opportunity when they had the chance. So, what you are sharing, I can understand that, in reality, things are much more challenging over there.
24/01/24, 12:02 pm - +263 71 293 5302: Yes  things are challenging here that is why l choose abroad
24/01/24, 12:03 pm - Harmehak: I do understand and I am glad you are making efforts for a promising future, Natalie.

Now as you know Edoofa Recommends India as a Higher Education destination.

*May I know what is your knowledge or what have you researched about India and Indian Education System which makes you feel that studying in India would help you achieve your dreams?*

24/01/24, 12:09 pm - Harmehak: I am glad this intrigued you, Natalie,

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
24/01/24, 12:10 pm - +263 71 293 5302: Yes they re
24/01/24, 12:10 pm - Harmehak: Can you please share your knowledge of the costs?
24/01/24, 12:11 pm - +263 71 293 5302: $8000-$12000
24/01/24, 12:11 pm - +263 71 293 5302: Without a scholarship
24/01/24, 12:13 pm - Harmehak: Very correct!
24/01/24, 12:14 pm - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
24/01/24, 12:14 pm - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
24/01/24, 12:14 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
24/01/24, 12:16 pm - +263 71 293 5302: Okay thank you l now have full information
24/01/24, 12:20 pm - Harmehak: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $2000-3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, 

Now *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

What are you thoughts on the same please?
24/01/24, 12:22 pm - +263 71 293 5302: The program is good because you gave everyone the chance to learn its really good <This message was edited>
24/01/24, 12:22 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate your kind words, Natalie
24/01/24, 12:23 pm - Harmehak: Natalie, from his experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,

While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time. 

This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year. 

Wouldn't you agree to the same?
24/01/24, 12:23 pm - +263 71 293 5302: Yes
24/01/24, 12:24 pm - Harmehak: So now are you in a better position to relate how Edoofa is making higher education affordable and accessible for international students in India, Natalie?
24/01/24, 12:24 pm - +263 71 293 5302: Yes l am
24/01/24, 12:39 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

Now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program in detail and how it would assist you.
24/01/24, 12:39 pm - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
24/01/24, 12:39 pm - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
24/01/24, 12:39 pm - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

24/01/24, 12:56 pm - +263 71 293 5302: Okay
24/01/24, 12:56 pm - +263 71 293 5302: Thank you l understand
24/01/24, 12:59 pm - Harmehak: I am glad!
24/01/24, 12:59 pm - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
24/01/24, 1:01 pm - +263 71 293 5302: Okay thank you
24/01/24, 1:02 pm - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

24/01/24, 1:07 pm - +263 71 293 5302: Yes l realize
24/01/24, 1:07 pm - Harmehak: Did you thoroughly go through the shared resources, Natalie?
24/01/24, 1:09 pm - +263 71 293 5302: Yes
24/01/24, 1:13 pm - Harmehak: That is great, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes. 

Are you ready?
24/01/24, 1:13 pm - +263 71 293 5302: Yes
24/01/24, 1:15 pm - Harmehak: Natalie, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
24/01/24, 1:15 pm - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
24/01/24, 1:17 pm - +263 71 293 5302: $1500-$2250
24/01/24, 1:17 pm - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
24/01/24, 1:17 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
24/01/24, 1:17 pm - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
24/01/24, 1:19 pm - +263 71 293 5302: This $750 is a once payment or is it included in the tution fee accomodation and other things
24/01/24, 1:19 pm - Harmehak: Did you go through the same please?
24/01/24, 1:20 pm - +263 71 293 5302: Okay l understand
24/01/24, 1:20 pm - Harmehak: This message was deleted
24/01/24, 1:20 pm - +263 71 293 5302: So $350 is for registration only
24/01/24, 1:20 pm - Harmehak: Natalie, Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
24/01/24, 1:21 pm - +263 71 293 5302: Yes thank you l now understand
24/01/24, 1:22 pm - Harmehak: That's amazing, so now that you have understood how Edoofa makes the application process affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
24/01/24, 1:22 pm - Harmehak: Now as you can see, because of such an amazing opportunity that Edoofa provides to its students, Edoofa receives thousands of applications on a  daily basis out of which Eligibility Evaluation takes place as I did share with you above, so only if the student is found eligible for the program and get their Acceptance Letter, *they will have to pay the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Acceptance Letter after which they start with their admission process and the Earn While You Learn Program.*
24/01/24, 1:22 pm - Harmehak: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
24/01/24, 1:25 pm - +263 71 293 5302: Okay l understand
24/01/24, 1:26 pm - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
24/01/24, 1:26 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
24/01/24, 1:26 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in their country itself.
24/01/24, 1:26 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
24/01/24, 1:27 pm - +263 71 293 5302: Yes l understand
24/01/24, 1:37 pm - Harmehak: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
24/01/24, 1:37 pm - Harmehak: Basically, this registration fee ($500-$1000) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024-2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
24/01/24, 1:37 pm - Harmehak: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*

Here is a picture of the Visa of one of the Edoofian who arrived in India, for 2023 Academic Intake.
24/01/24, 1:37 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
24/01/24, 1:42 pm - +263 71 293 5302: I understand thank you
24/01/24, 1:48 pm - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
24/01/24, 1:48 pm - Harmehak: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)
24/01/24, 1:48 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
24/01/24, 1:50 pm - +263 71 293 5302: Okay
24/01/24, 1:51 pm - Harmehak: Do connect your parents with Mrs Ruth as well as Anna, Natalie!
24/01/24, 1:55 pm - +263 71 293 5302: Okay
24/01/24, 1:55 pm - Harmehak: As of now, do you have any queries?
24/01/24, 1:56 pm - +263 71 293 5302: No
24/01/24, 1:57 pm - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
24/01/24, 1:57 pm - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
24/01/24, 1:57 pm - Harmehak: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

Your scholarship journey is reaching a crucial juncture. *Tomorrow, on “25-01-23” at 11:30 A.M. CAT,* I will meticulously evaluate your application. This session is not just about answering your questions; it includes a vital Eligibility Check Interview.

We strongly recommend parents/guardians join, recognizing that higher education is a family decision.

24/01/24, 8:27 pm - Harmehak added +263 77 310 4476
25/01/24, 11:31 am - Harmehak: Good Morning, Hope you are doing well.

I believe you must have discussed all the above mentioned points with your family?

I am here to address any questions if they have any.

Are we good to proceed with your application now?
25/01/24, 11:49 am - +263 71 293 5302: Good morning how are you ..Yes we can

25/01/24, 11:50 am - Harmehak: So how was your discussion with your parents, Natalie?

What all did you discuss with them?
25/01/24, 11:50 am - +263 71 293 5302: The discussion was perfectly fine
25/01/24, 11:51 am - +263 71 293 5302: We discuss about how Edoofa will make my learning easier and also about the EWYL program
25/01/24, 11:52 am - Harmehak: That's great, Natalie!

What all would you or your parents like to ask?
25/01/24, 11:52 am - +263 71 293 5302: There is nothing we all understood
25/01/24, 11:53 am - Harmehak: Alright please!
25/01/24, 11:53 am - Harmehak: Have you already had the opportunity to connect with Mrs. Ruth? 

You see, her story is truly remarkable. As a single parent, juggling the responsibilities of a small-scale farmer and the mother of two daughters, she has persevered. Her journey with Edoofa is a testament to how dedicated individuals can overcome obstacles.
Mrs. Ruth's experience with Edoofa is a testament to the transformative impact our programs can have. She not only managed her family's needs but also seized the opportunity for her daughters to achieve higher education. The support and guidance she received from Edoofa were instrumental in her success. The process was challenging, yet incredibly rewarding. Mrs. Ruth's determination, combined with Edoofa's assistance, has paved the way for a brighter future.

25/01/24, 1:01 pm - Harmehak: Yes please
25/01/24, 2:03 pm - +263 77 231 3434: <Media omitted>
25/01/24, 2:04 pm - Harmehak: Mr Lloyd, you see as per my experience over the last couple of years, I have been fortunate to have assisted over hundreds of students in achieving their career aspiration through the Edoofa Program. 

One of my key observations during helping out these students was regarding what was the common trait amongst students who are today having the best of their time in India through the Edoofa Program, and honestly I was able to come down to only one aspect that is FAMILY SUPPORT.
25/01/24, 2:04 pm - Harmehak: You see in this journey of any child's higher education, there are three major contributors 

1. Student himself/herself
2. FAMILY
3. EDOOFA PROGAM

Now all the students who are today successfully a part of the Edoofa Program, had all these three contributors working together towards the common goal which is student's success and ensuring that by the time student completes his/her higher education they should be able to get good paying jobs. 

Even if any one of the contributor does not perform to the best of their abilities, Student's overall success is hampered. Let me give you a few examples

*In the event if student wishes to work hard, Edoofa is willing to support but the Family is not willing to support, the student will not be successful under the program*

*In the event if student wishes to work hard, Family is willing to support, but Edoofa's academic Board doesn't find the student worthy, the student will not be successful under the program*

*In the event if Family is willing to support, Edoofa's Academic Board is willing to support but the student doesn't wishes to work hard, then also the student will not be successful under the program*
25/01/24, 2:04 pm - Harmehak: During the evaluation of your child's application so far, the Academic Board has evaluated a few aspects, such as student's willingness to work hard, and family's willingness to support the student so that the student can achieve what he/she has aspired. However now in your interview ahead, the Academic Board would be strictly be evaluating the Family's support towards the child higher education. 

*As you know in the event if your child is found eligible, you would have to complete a certain part of the formalities within the 7 day timeline, so may I know regarding the same, are you willing to support your child to the fullest?*
25/01/24, 2:40 pm - Harmehak: Kindly acknowledge the same using a voice note, Mr Lloyd.
26/01/24, 5:35 pm - +263 77 231 3434: <Media omitted>
26/01/24, 5:36 pm - +263 77 231 3434: Sorry was very busy since yesterday
26/01/24, 6:14 pm - Harmehak: Good Evening Mr Lloyd!
26/01/24, 6:14 pm - Harmehak: I do understand please
26/01/24, 6:15 pm - Harmehak: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
26/01/24, 6:15 pm - Harmehak: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
26/01/24, 6:15 pm - Harmehak: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.
26/01/24, 6:15 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
26/01/24, 6:15 pm - +263 77 231 3434: Evening how a u
26/01/24, 6:16 pm - Harmehak: Ideally as you know, the tentative dates:

1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 2nd or 3rd February 2024 for $200 and the 2nd or 3rd of March for the remaining $150.

2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 2nd or 3rd February 2024. 

Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?
