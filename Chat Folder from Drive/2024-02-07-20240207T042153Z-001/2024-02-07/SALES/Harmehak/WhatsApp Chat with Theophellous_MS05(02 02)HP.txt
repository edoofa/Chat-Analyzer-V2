05/02/24, 9:35 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
05/02/24, 9:36 am - +263 78 885 3691: Yes we can start
05/02/24, 9:50 am - Harmehak: So may I know what motivates you to study Medicine, Theophellous.

Along with the same, what all did you research regarding Medicine?
05/02/24, 10:25 am - +263 78 885 3691: I used to say when I grow up I want to be a doctor when I was still an infant and I grow up with that in mentality. 
Now in my country Zimbabwe doctors are one of the most paid workers and that motivates me more to study medicine
05/02/24, 10:28 am - Harmehak: I do understand, Theophellous!

So what all did you research regarding the requirements for Medicine?
05/02/24, 10:31 am - +263 78 885 3691: Whe I did my research the requirements needed were Chemistry as compulsory ,mathematics and any of the two between physics and biology
05/02/24, 10:37 am - Harmehak: Alright, however what is your take on the importance of Biology, Theophellous?

Considering, Biology is all about living being and humans and so is Medicine!
05/02/24, 10:43 am - +263 78 885 3691: It helps us better understand the human body and how our body functions. It also gives us a better understanding of why we get sick and what we can do to stay healthy.
05/02/24, 10:47 am - Harmehak: Very correct!
05/02/24, 10:47 am - Harmehak: Well, if you would have researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*. whereas if they want to study any Engineering Course then they should have *Physics and Maths* in their A level mandatorily.
05/02/24, 10:52 am - +263 78 885 3691: Okay so am I not able to study medicine with my A level subjects
05/02/24, 10:54 am - Harmehak: Now, majority of the time Zimbabwean students study subjects as per Zimbabwe's requirements, therefore, the only courses left that these students could pursue ahead which would also align with the healthcare sector are :

*1. Bachelor in Pharmacy*
*2. Bachelor in Optometry*
*3. Bachelor of Technology in Biomedical Engineering*
*4. Bachelor of Science in Medical Laboratory Technology*
*5. Bachelor of Science in Nutrition and Dietetics*
05/02/24, 10:55 am - Harmehak: I have an interest in the following fields of study. (Select the relevant one):-Engineering

Theophellous, I can see you happened to mention Engineering itself in your form too, so may I know more regarding the same?
05/02/24, 11:00 am - +263 78 885 3691: I had heard some people saying in India Engineering is the best program you can study and I mentioned it but in my mind I wanted to study medicine
05/02/24, 11:09 am - Harmehak: Oh alright please,

I do understand.
05/02/24, 11:10 am - Harmehak: However, Indian education is known for both Engineering and Medical Education, Theophellous.
05/02/24, 11:12 am - +263 78 885 3691: I understand now.But with my A level subjects can I be part of the medical Education?
05/02/24, 11:18 am - Harmehak: Now, if a student does not have the required subjects to study medicine in India, there are alternative options available in the field of healthcare. Pursuing a degree in Medical Laboratory Technology can be a viable route to eventually pursuing a major in medicine.

Medical Laboratory Technology involves the analysis of body fluids and tissues to diagnose diseases and aid in treatment. It requires a strong foundation in science and mathematics and offers courses in biochemistry, microbiology, haematology, and immunology, among others. Students with a degree in Medical Laboratory Technology can work in labs, hospitals, and clinics, and can gain valuable experience in the field of medicine.

Medical Laboratory Technology can provide students with a solid foundation in the healthcare field and valuable experience in the medical industry. Pursuing a major in medicine after obtaining a degree in the field it is possible, and students can gain an advantage over their peers by having a more diverse skill set and experience in the field. It is important for parents to encourage their children to explore alternative options in the field of healthcare if they are unable to pursue a major in medicine initially.
05/02/24, 11:18 am - Harmehak: If you have a bachelor's degree in Medical Laboratory Technology from India and are interested in pursuing further studies in medicine, you may consider the following options:

1. **Doctor of Medicine (MD):**
   - MD is a postgraduate degree that medical professionals pursue to specialize in a specific field of medicine. Specializations can include internal medicine, surgery, pediatrics, obstetrics and gynecology, radiology, pathology, etc.

2. **Master of Surgery (MS):**
   - Similar to MD, MS is a postgraduate degree that focuses on surgical specialties. Surgeons typically pursue this degree to specialize in areas such as general surgery, orthopedics, ophthalmology, etc.

3. **Diplomate of National Board (DNB):**
   - DNB is a postgraduate or postdoctoral degree in various medical specialties. It is offered by the National Board of Examinations in India and is equivalent to MD or MS.

4. **Postgraduate Diploma in Clinical Pathology (DCP):**
   - This is a diploma program that focuses on clinical pathology and is suitable for individuals with a background in laboratory technology.

5. **Masters in Public Health (MPH):**
   - If you are interested in public health, an MPH degree could be a good option. It covers a range of topics including epidemiology, health policy, biostatistics, and environmental health.

6. **Hospital Management/Administration:**
   - You may consider pursuing a Master's in Hospital Administration or Healthcare Management to take on administrative roles in healthcare organizations.

It's important to note that the specific options available to you may depend on the admission requirements of the medical schools or universities in the country where you plan to pursue further studies. Additionally, some countries may have specific requirements for international medical graduates, so it's advisable to research the admission criteria for the institutions you're interested in.

Keep in mind that different countries may have different systems of medical education, and the nomenclature of degrees may vary. It's crucial to carefully research and understand the educational and licensing requirements of the country in which you plan to practice medicine.
05/02/24, 11:25 am - +263 78 885 3691: I understand now
05/02/24, 11:50 am - Harmehak: So far,may I know what all would you like to ask?
05/02/24, 11:53 am - +263 78 885 3691: This message was deleted
05/02/24, 12:05 pm - +263 78 885 3691: So it means  I can not study medicine in india ??
05/02/24, 12:18 pm - Harmehak: Did you go through the same, Theophellous?
05/02/24, 5:49 pm - Harmehak: I was expecting your response, now I would be scheduling your session for *tomorrow at 9:30 AM CAT*, as my working hours for the day are over and it's already been a long day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.
05/02/24, 5:53 pm - +263 78 885 3691: I go through it but I can't do the offered programmes
05/02/24, 5:56 pm - Harmehak: While I understand, Theophilus,

I believe you understand that Biology is a crucial requirement for Medicine here in India?
05/02/24, 6:16 pm - +263 78 885 3691: Yeah I understand
05/02/24, 6:19 pm - Harmehak: Theophellous, are you aware that Biomedical Sciences is an undergrad prerequisite into MBChB?

In Zimbabwe, one will not be accepted into MBChB without it. That's the undergrad degree with all preclinical courses. One isn't accepted into it from Advanced level. So one gets it then apply for MBChB.
05/02/24, 8:14 pm - +263 78 885 3691: Yes I am aware of that but that's not the way I wanted to use
06/02/24, 9:34 am - Harmehak: This is the way in Zimbabwe, Theophellous.
06/02/24, 9:34 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!
06/02/24, 9:51 am - +263 78 885 3691: I am doing well
06/02/24, 9:52 am - Harmehak: So how exactly do you wish to pursue medicine please?
06/02/24, 3:01 pm - +263 78 885 3691: I wanted to go straight into medicine
06/02/24, 3:02 pm - Harmehak: In Zimbabwe, one will not be accepted into MBChB without Biomedical Sciences which is an undergrad prerequisite.
06/02/24, 5:52 pm - +263 78 885 3691: So how many years is the biomedical sciences studying
06/02/24, 5:52 pm - Harmehak: That's the degree in Zimbabwe, Theophellous
