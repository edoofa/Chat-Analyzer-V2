05/02/24, 12:34 pm - Harmehak: *Bachelor of Arts - Bachelor of Legislative Law* is a 5 year course which integrates Arts with Law.

A course in BA LLB is an exciting one that offers multiple career opportunities. The 5 key positions associated with this course are:

*1) Legal Advisor*
The main role of a legal advisor or legal counsellor is to offer legal advice and work, for organizations and the employees of the organization. Their services can be utilized by the Government, NGOs, other associations or large organizations.  The legal advisors are in-house experts, in contrast to attorneys and supporters who offer their services to society in general. It is often seen that legal advisors were former advocates and therefore their skills and training have to be in accordance with those that are needed for attorneys and advocates.

*2) Lawyer*
As is evident by the title, is a person whose profession is law. There are different specializations for law including Cyber law, Environmental law, Company law, Criminal law and Family Law. Their main job role is to represent their clients in jurisdiction matters. Their work involves a lot of research, including that on the subject and their client’s perspective. They then go on to represent and defend their clients in the court.

*3) Public Prosecutor*
A Public Prosecutor is a criminal lawyer who is hired by the government. He may either be hired by the central or the state government to represent the interests of the state in any criminal trial. Their role starts once the police have investigated and filed the charge sheet in court. The expectation from the Public Prosecutor is that he acts in the interests of the general public and is fair and ethical. The criminal procedure code of 1973 under section 24, outlines the arrangements concerning the Public Prosecutor.

*4) Judge*
This role is considered to be very prestigious by any law student. Immediately after the completion of graduation, an individual can appear for a lower judiciary exam. The age group depending on different states varies between 21 to 35 years. The qualities of righteousness, good ethics and a passion for justice are some of the key qualities needed for this job.

*5) Company Secretary*
This job is for students who want to work in the corporate sector. This job requires a degree from ICSI or the Institute of Company secretaries of India. A lot of dedication and hard work is required to complete this course with your law degree, but on successful completion, this career can be extremely rewarding.

A career in law is considered to be much sought after, satisfying and lucrative.

*Required Skill-Set for BA LLB*
It is rightly said that learning is an on – going process and this holds true especially in the aspect of personal and professional development. Although an individual may possess certain skills they need to be improved and developed constantly. A few key skills that are of paramount importance in the field of law are:

*Good Written Communication*– Writing forms a major part of the work in in the legal profession. The written communication involves letters, documents, notices, and so on. The documents must be grammatically correct and error free. This requires a good level of English proficiency.

*Good Verbal Communication*– A lot depends on how well the legal professional can express his or her case, arguments and generally converse with clients and authorities. Good verbal communication ensures good expression and understanding which are crucial for a successful career in law.

*Good Time Management*– In the legal profession, time management is very crucial. The art of delegating tasks, working within deadlines, and prioritizing tasks to achieve success is very essential.

*A great degree of self-confidence*– This profession needs a high degree of self-confidence to win the clients’ trust. A strong belief in yourself will go a long way in winning arguments and cases.

*An analytical mind and good research skills*– A case with proper research and well-reasoned out and evaluated argument stands a very high chance of success.

*High EQ (Emotional Quotient)*– Individuals in the legal profession, especially lawyers, must learn to be empathetic.

*Tech Savvy*– In the rapidly developing and evolving technological world, they must be abreast of the latest technology to understand and use it, as and when needed. They need to use technology to their advantage to improve their efficiency and chances of success.

*Good Commercial awareness*– This is not only restricted to being aware of the current trends and technology, prevalent in the world of business and law, but also being aware of the developments in the world of business and law, both nationally and globally.

*A high degree of patience*– This is a much needed skill, since you deal with different types of people and some cases and procedures stretch over a period of time which need a lot of patience and careful handling.

*Team player skills*– Since a legal professional will deal with a lot of people therefore to be effective they need to bond with people. The art of getting work done and obtaining information though networking and working with people helps in attaining the objectives.
05/02/24, 12:40 pm - +263 78 670 6339: Thank you i understand
05/02/24, 12:48 pm - Harmehak: Alright Talent, since you have understood the course, can you please tell me, if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself in 5 years and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?

05/02/24, 1:02 pm - Harmehak: That is really great Talent, I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations!

Now, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
05/02/24, 1:10 pm - +263 78 670 6339: Oky  so basically  i cant really say i dont want to study in my country but  when the opportunity rise you need to comply..And the actual truth is that  i need to study where job opportunities are soon after graduation and the other thing is that  you can also get exposed to other countries  culture and  also our countries carries a lot of expenses in terms of applying for university because u need to pay application fee for each university  you apply to since i can apply to one university  so with one thing at hand money is saved and is used for other things
05/02/24, 1:16 pm - Harmehak: You see, Talent, Senior Academician Mr. Piyush was in Zimbabwe for about 90 days. He had the privilege of meeting many Zimbabwean students who had applied for the Edoofa Program back in 2018-2019. However, at that time, they didn't proceed because they were enticed by the prospect of earning quick money in the country. This year, when they met him, they shared how difficult things have been for them. Some of them, despite holding reputed degrees from UZ, MSU, and HIT, are working as petrol attendants, while others have started careers as mobile/laptop repair technicians. Some were facing even more challenges, resorting to selling Ecocash, Simcards, or vegetables.

Observing this scenario, Mr. Piyush saw many of them regretting not seizing the opportunity when they had the chance. So, I am glad you are making efforts for a promising future..
05/02/24, 1:17 pm - +263 78 670 6339: Thank you
05/02/24, 1:21 pm - Harmehak: *Meanwhile I would like to add that now we have five students who will be traveling to India from Mt Selinda High School for their higher education through the Edoofa Program in the August 2024 intake and one student for the August 2025 intake.*

05/02/24, 1:24 pm - +263 78 670 6339: Yes  am

05/02/24, 2:10 pm - +263 78 670 6339: Yes i did
05/02/24, 2:10 pm - Harmehak: I am glad, Talent!

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
05/02/24, 2:15 pm - +263 78 670 6339: No we are not
05/02/24, 2:17 pm - Harmehak: Alright please!
05/02/24, 2:17 pm - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
05/02/24, 2:17 pm - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
05/02/24, 2:17 pm - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
05/02/24, 2:17 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
05/02/24, 2:19 pm - +263 78 670 6339: So this shows that the indian coast is  affordable than other countries
05/02/24, 2:19 pm - Harmehak: Indeed!
05/02/24, 2:20 pm - +263 78 670 6339: Oky
05/02/24, 2:20 pm - Harmehak: In simple words Talent, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
05/02/24, 2:21 pm - +263 78 670 6339: Oky thus nice
05/02/24, 2:21 pm - Harmehak: However as per my experience, I can share with you that *if you are able to perform and clear all these criteria with a high passing grade, you would be eligible for higher quantum of Scholarship*, in which you will just have to pay a minimal fee of *$1200-$1800*, Which would cover your entire fees be it food, accommodation, Tuition etc.
05/02/24, 2:22 pm - +263 78 670 6339: Oky thus great
05/02/24, 2:25 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

Now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program in detail and how it would assist you.
05/02/24, 2:25 pm - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
05/02/24, 2:25 pm - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
05/02/24, 2:25 pm - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

2. Recruitment Partners:

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

05/02/24, 2:30 pm - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $1800 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$600 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $50-$60 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
05/02/24, 2:31 pm - +263 78 670 6339: Oky nice to know
05/02/24, 3:26 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate
05/02/24, 3:27 pm - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

05/02/24, 3:42 pm - +263 78 670 6339: Oky i did see
05/02/24, 3:44 pm - +263 78 670 6339: Yes i can see now
05/02/24, 3:51 pm - Harmehak: That is great, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes. 

Are you ready?
05/02/24, 3:53 pm - +263 78 670 6339: Yes
05/02/24, 3:54 pm - Harmehak: Talent, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
05/02/24, 3:54 pm - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
05/02/24, 3:56 pm - +263 78 670 6339: 1500  if 300 and 2250 if  450
05/02/24, 3:57 pm - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
05/02/24, 3:57 pm - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
05/02/24, 3:57 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
05/02/24, 3:57 pm - +263 78 670 6339: Oky
05/02/24, 3:58 pm - +263 78 670 6339: Oky less expensive
05/02/24, 3:58 pm - Harmehak: Talent, Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
05/02/24, 3:59 pm - +263 78 670 6339: Oky
05/02/24, 3:59 pm - +263 78 670 6339: Yeah it's good since it reduce cost
05/02/24, 4:01 pm - Harmehak: That's amazing, so now that you have understood how Edoofa makes the application process affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
05/02/24, 4:01 pm - Harmehak: Now as you can see, because of such an amazing opportunity that Edoofa provides to its students, Edoofa receives thousands of applications on a  daily basis out of which Eligibility Evaluation takes place as I did share with you above, so only if the student is found eligible for the program and get their Acceptance Letter, *they will have to pay the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Acceptance Letter after which they start with their admission process and the Earn While You Learn Program.*
05/02/24, 4:01 pm - Harmehak: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
05/02/24, 4:02 pm - +263 78 670 6339: Oky this is nice since it consider the economy
05/02/24, 4:03 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate please!
05/02/24, 4:04 pm - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
05/02/24, 4:04 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
05/02/24, 4:05 pm - +263 78 670 6339: Oky
05/02/24, 4:05 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in their country itself.
05/02/24, 4:05 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
05/02/24, 4:05 pm - +263 78 670 6339: So  us we still in stage one
05/02/24, 4:06 pm - +263 78 670 6339: Yes i do
05/02/24, 4:06 pm - Harmehak: We would be concluding Stage 1 within 5-10 minutes from now.
05/02/24, 4:07 pm - +263 78 670 6339: Oky
05/02/24, 4:07 pm - Harmehak: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
05/02/24, 4:07 pm - Harmehak: Basically, this registration fee ($500-$1000) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024-2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
05/02/24, 4:07 pm - Harmehak: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*

Here is a picture of the Visa of one of the Edoofian who arrived in India, for 2023 Academic Intake.

05/02/24, 4:09 pm - +263 78 670 6339: I understand
05/02/24, 4:09 pm - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
05/02/24, 4:09 pm - Harmehak: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)
05/02/24, 4:10 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>

05/02/24, 4:14 pm - Harmehak: Yes please,

Do connect your parents with Mrs Ruth as well.
05/02/24, 4:14 pm - +263 78 670 6339: Oky
05/02/24, 4:20 pm - Harmehak: Yes please
05/02/24, 4:21 pm - +263 78 670 6339: I did speak to her
05/02/24, 4:25 pm - Harmehak: That's great, Talent!
05/02/24, 4:25 pm - +263 78 670 6339: Okay
05/02/24, 4:33 pm - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
05/02/24, 4:33 pm - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
05/02/24, 4:33 pm - Harmehak: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

Your scholarship journey is reaching a crucial juncture. *Tomorrow on “05-02-23” at 11:30 A.M. CAT,* I will meticulously evaluate your application. This session is not just about answering your questions; it includes a vital Eligibility Check Interview.

We strongly recommend parents/guardians join, recognizing that higher education is a family decision. Prepare for a series of interviews, marking a significant phase in finalizing your scholarship application. As your counselor, I wish you the very best. It's been a pleasure guiding you through your career sessions.

If you qualify for the interview, we would proceed ahead and we look forward to welcoming you to India. Please be proactive, as everyone's time is valuable. The Senior Counselor and Director will make decisions based on your interview and adhere strictly to the given time. Follow instructions diligently, and if the session is completed within the allotted time, your application will proceed.

Happy Family Discussion!
Stay Blessed!
05/02/24, 4:36 pm - +263 78 670 6339: Thank you
05/02/24, 4:40 pm - Harmehak: You're very welcome
05/02/24, 5:42 pm - Harmehak: Kindly excuse me for the same,

*Tomorrow, 06-02-23*
05/02/24, 6:06 pm - +263 78 670 6339: Oky
05/02/24, 6:41 pm - Harmehak: Do go through the shared video to learn more about the experiences of our Proud Edoofians!
05/02/24, 6:41 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
05/02/24, 6:53 pm - +263 78 670 6339: Oky
06/02/24, 11:36 am - Harmehak: Good Morning Everyone, Hope you are doing well.

I believe you must have discussed all the above mentioned points with your family?

I am here to address any questions if they have any.

Are we good to proceed with your application now?
06/02/24, 12:45 pm - +263 78 670 6339: A having serious network problems
06/02/24, 12:45 pm - Harmehak: I do understand!
06/02/24, 12:45 pm - Harmehak: I would like to share an exciting news that, *We will be visiting Zimbabwe this month to prepare our Edoofians for the journey ahead and we look forward to you being a part of the mega seminar for aspirants.*
06/02/24, 12:56 pm - +263 78 670 6339: We be happy to see you
06/02/24, 12:56 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate please!
06/02/24, 12:57 pm - Harmehak: So how was your discussion with your parents, Talent?

What all did you discuss with them?
06/02/24, 1:01 pm - +263 78 670 6339: Oky the discussion of what course  to do and then we did discuss and then bring out that aviation.Hosiptality.Travel and trourism management  is somehow a best course for me to do but your scholaship doesnt have this programmy
06/02/24, 1:06 pm - Harmehak: Alright please!

From where did you learn the same please, Talent?
06/02/24, 1:08 pm - +263 78 670 6339: Oky the parul university do  offers i guess basing on what i have checked
06/02/24, 1:09 pm - Harmehak: It is quite unfortunate to hear about that, since Edoofa is associated with some of the finest and the most resourceful universities in India, we are partnered up with more than 250+ Universities in India but we are not associated with Parul University because of a reason.
06/02/24, 1:09 pm - Harmehak: The reason being Parul University isn't ranked under NIRF and the degrees offered by them are not recognized on a global level, it is because the founders are accused of rape. 

When we know all this about the university and the management working there, there is no way we can ever think of partnering with such universities and sending our students over there. 

For your reference, I am sharing the link to the news with you so that you can check the same for yourself.

06/02/24, 1:09 pm - Harmehak: Infact in many places in India the degree won't' be valid as well!
06/02/24, 1:11 pm - +263 78 670 6339: Oh oky thank  you
06/02/24, 1:11 pm - +263 78 670 6339: Thank you for this
06/02/24, 1:13 pm - Harmehak: While I would like to add that we do offer Tourism and Travel Management!
06/02/24, 1:14 pm - +263 78 670 6339: Oky thank  you and  thanks a lot for sharing the information
06/02/24, 1:14 pm - Harmehak: You're very welcome!
06/02/24, 1:15 pm - Harmehak: Did you happen to connect with any of these students or Mrs Mavis?
06/02/24, 1:16 pm - +263 78 670 6339: I did with Mrs Mavis
06/02/24, 1:17 pm - Harmehak: That's good!

So what all would you or your parents like to ask, Talent?
06/02/24, 1:18 pm - +263 78 670 6339: About the law it is international right meaning  i would not want  to conduct any other learing process if i go to other countrie
06/02/24, 1:35 pm - Harmehak: The degrees are internationally recognised!

You would only have to get your degree validated from the country where you would like to practice law and appear for the Bar Exam!
06/02/24, 1:39 pm - +263 78 670 6339: Oky  now   i noe
06/02/24, 1:39 pm - +263 78 670 6339: Oky now i know
06/02/24, 1:39 pm - Harmehak: I am glad!

What else would you like to ask?
06/02/24, 1:41 pm - +263 78 670 6339: Actual  thus all i wanted to ask
06/02/24, 1:43 pm - Harmehak: Alright please!
06/02/24, 1:44 pm - Harmehak: Have you and your parents already had the opportunity to connect with Mrs. Ruth? 

You see, her story is truly remarkable. As a single parent, juggling the responsibilities of a small-scale farmer and the mother of two daughters, she has persevered. Her journey with Edoofa is a testament to how dedicated individuals can overcome obstacles.
Mrs. Ruth's experience with Edoofa is a testament to the transformative impact our programs can have. She not only managed her family's needs but also seized the opportunity for her daughters to achieve higher education. The support and guidance she received from Edoofa were instrumental in her success. The process was challenging, yet incredibly rewarding. Mrs. Ruth's determination, combined with Edoofa's assistance, has paved the way for a brighter future.
06/02/24, 1:57 pm - +263 78 670 6339: Yeah i   understood all she said
06/02/24, 1:59 pm - Harmehak: Okay so in that case, I would like to ask you a few questions, but before that with immense pleasure, I would like to share the glimpses of the Africa Visit of our Founders which took place in June 2023! 

*It was a much-awaited event and they were welcomed by Ministries, Educationalists, Edoofians, and Parents across different African Countries. This is a must-watch video depicting the Acceptance of the Program in the African Continent, especially in Zimbabwe!!*
06/02/24, 2:00 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
06/02/24, 2:24 pm - +263 78 670 6339: A done watching
06/02/24, 2:32 pm - Harmehak: So are you excited to join this year's event in Zimbabwe, Talent?
06/02/24, 2:35 pm - +263 78 670 6339: Yes am
06/02/24, 2:36 pm - Harmehak: That's great
06/02/24, 2:37 pm - Harmehak: So Talent, can you tell me:-

1. What is the name of the course which you would be studying through the Edoofa Program?

2. Through Edoofa in which country would you be pursuing your higher education?

3. What is the average cost for studies in that country without a scholarship?

4. What is the annual fee you will pay if found eligible for the program (yearly fee after Edoofa Scholarship)?

5. What is the enrollment fee of the Edoofa Program? 

6. If you are found eligible for the program in how many days you will have to pay the first part of your enrollment fee?

7. After receiving your offer letter from the Edoofa Academic Board, you will have to pay your registration fee in order to finalise your university admission and reserve your scholarship seat. This registration fee will be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?
06/02/24, 2:41 pm - +263 78 670 6339: 1..International  law
2..Ay country  which is offered
3.. I dont noe..
4..Prize that is afforedble for the parents..
5...Maybe 20days...

6Yes am
06/02/24, 2:44 pm - Harmehak: Talent, did you follow the discussion properly yesterday?

*Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage.*
A fact that draws our attention is that, according to his position in life, an extravagant man is either admired or loathed. A successful business man does nothing to increase his popularity by being prudent with his money. A person who is wealthy is expected to lead a luxurious life and to be lavish with his hospitality. If he is not so, he is considered mean, and his reputation in business may even suffer in consequence. The paradox remains that he had not been careful with his money in the first place; he would never have achieved his present wealth.
Among the low income group, a different set of values exists. The young clerk, who makes his wife a present of a new dress when he has not paid his house rent, is condemned as extravagant. Carefulness with money to the point of meanness is applauded as a virtue. Nothing in his life is considered more worthy than paying his bills. The ideal wife for such a man separates her housekeeping money into joyless little piles – so much for rent, for food, for the children’s shoes, she is able to face the milkman with equanimity every, month satisfied with her economizing ways , and never knows the guilt of buying something she can’t really afford .
As for myself, I fall neither of these categories. If I have money to spare I can be extravagant, but when, as is usually the case, I am hard up and then I am the meanest man imaginable.

1. Which of the following would be the most appropriate title for the passage
a)The cause of poverty is extravagance.
b)Stingy habits of the poor.
c)Being extravagant is always condemnable.
d)Extravagance is a part of the rich as well as of the poor.

2.According to the passage the person, who is a successful businessman and wealthy
a)Is more popular if he appears to be wasting away his time.
b)Is expected to have lavish lifestyle.
c)Must be extravagant before achieving success.
d)Should not bother about popularity.

3. The phrase ‘lavish with his hospitality’ in the third sentence of the first paragraph means
a)Extravagance in entertaining guest.
b)Unconcerned in treating his friends and relatives.
c)Thoughtful in spending only on guests and strangers.
d)Stinginess in dealing with his relatives.

4.The word ‘paradox’ in the last sentence of the first paragraph means
a)A word that brings out the hidden meaning
b)Statement based on facts
c)a statement that seems self-contradictory but in reality expresses a possible truth.
d)Statement based on the popular opinion

5.What is the meaning of the word “equanimity”?
a)Calmness
b)Discomposure
c)Equivocal

Whey to Go Greek yogurt—a strained form of cultured yogurt—has grown enormously in popularity in the United States since it was first introduced in the country in the late 1980s. From 2011 to 2012 alone, sales of Greek yogurt in the US increased by 50 percent. The resulting increase in Greek yogurt production has forced those involved in the business to address the detrimental effects that the yogurt-making process may be having on the environment. Fortunately, farmers and others in the Greek yogurt business have found many methods of controlling and eliminating most environmental threats. Given these solutions as well as the many health benefits of the food, the advantages of Greek yogurt Q5. outdo the potential drawbacks of its production.Sentence [1] The main environmental problem caused by the production of Greek yogurt is the creation of acid whey as a by-product.Sentence [2] Because it requires up to four times more milk to make than conventional yogurt does, Greek yogurt produces larger amounts of acid whey, which is difficult to dispose of.Sentence [3] To address the problem of disposal, farmers have found a number of uses for acid whey. Sentence[4] They can add it to livestock feed as a protein Q.6. supplement, and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt.Sentence[5] If it is improperly introduced into the environment, acid-whey runoff Q.7. can pollute waterways, depleting the oxygen content of streams and rivers as it decomposes.

Tha above view is valid to a lesserr extend taling into consideration the some parts of africa the agricultural sector is poor resulting  to poor diet and food insecurity .However africa has many countries with many successful farms  and has good climate resulting in good bumber harvest and  enough food for most people.
In some parts of africa  where agriculture sector is underdeveloped  people face challanges of  lack of food,poor diet for example DRC,CHARD among  others have  problems of lack of food since their lack well equipped  equipments to uses in farms and also lack of agriculture inputs.Therefore  from the above agruement one can clealy say the above claim is true.
Also,climatic conditions  in africa affects farms in afriaca  causing shortage of food since  there  will be poor harvest for example countries like Malawi,Sudan have poor climatic conditions   which cause poor diets  and call diseases.Hence,The above claim became valid.
How ever one should not brush the fact that Africa is well know for its good agricultural sector   for example SouthAfrica,Nigeria and others have good soils which produce best products which  enables good diet and healthy in africa
