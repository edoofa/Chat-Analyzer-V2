The main role of a legal advisor or legal counsellor is to offer legal advice and work, for organizations and the employees of the organization. Their services can be utilized by the Government, NGOs, other associations or large organizations.  The legal advisors are in-house experts, in contrast to attorneys and supporters who offer their services to society in general. It is often seen that legal advisors were former advocates and therefore their skills and training have to be in accordance with those that are needed for attorneys and advocates.

*2) Lawyer*
As is evident by the title, is a person whose profession is law. There are different specializations for law including Cyber law, Environmental law, Company law, Criminal law and Family Law. Their main job role is to represent their clients in jurisdiction matters. Their work involves a lot of research, including that on the subject and their client’s perspective. They then go on to represent and defend their clients in the court.

A lot of dedication and hard work is required to complete this course with your law degree, but on successful completion, this career can be extremely rewarding.

A career in law is considered to be much sought after, satisfying and lucrative.

*Required Skill-Set for BA LLB*
It is rightly said that learning is an on – going process and this holds true especially in the aspect of personal and professional development. Although an individual may possess certain skills they need to be improved and developed constantly. A few key skills that are of paramount importance in the field of law are:

*Good Written Communication*– Writing forms a major part of the work in in the legal profession. The written communication involves letters, documents, notices, and so on. The documents must be grammatically correct and error free. This requires a good level of English proficiency.

*Good Verbal Communication*– A lot depends on how well the legal professional can express his or her case, arguments and generally converse with clients and authorities. Good verbal communication ensures good expression and understanding which are crucial for a successful career in law.

*Good Time Management*– In the legal profession, time management is very crucial. The art of delegating tasks, working within deadlines, and prioritizing tasks to achieve success is very essential.

*A great degree of self-confidence*– This profession needs a high degree of self-confidence to win the clients’ trust. A strong belief in yourself will go a long way in winning arguments and cases.

*A high degree of patience*– This is a much needed skill, since you deal with different types of people and some cases and procedures stretch over a period of time which need a lot of patience and careful handling.

*Team player skills*– Since a legal professional will deal with a lot of people therefore to be effective they need to bond with people. The art of getting work done and obtaining information though networking and working with people helps in attaining the objectives.

02/02/24, 1:25 pm - +263 77 485 5312: I have learnt a vast knowledge about lndia and l hope if engaged l will join the larder of invartion and leadership.
02/02/24, 1:26 pm - Harmehak: I am glad this intrigued you and you found it helpful, Margret.

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
02/02/24, 1:29 pm - +263 77 485 5312: Not really, l would be glad to have such knowledge. I am only aware of the local average universities  which  charge between $500 and $700USD per semester
02/02/24, 1:30 pm - Harmehak: Alright please!
02/02/24, 1:30 pm - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
02/02/24, 1:32 pm - +263 77 485 5312: Thank you once again for the information.
02/02/24, 1:32 pm - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
02/02/24, 1:32 pm - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
02/02/24, 1:32 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
02/02/24, 1:36 pm - +263 77 485 5312: That's great, l will be very comfortable with the earn and learn system which was also practiced by my father in Zimbabwe.
02/02/24, 1:38 pm - Harmehak: That's very correct, Margret!
02/02/24, 1:38 pm - Harmehak: In simple words Margret, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
02/02/24, 1:38 pm - Harmehak: However as per my experience, I can share with you that *if you are able to perform and clear all these criteria with a high passing grade, you would be eligible for higher quantum of Scholarship*, in which you will just have to pay a minimal fee of *$1200-$1800*, Which would cover your entire fees be it food, accommodation, Tuition etc.
02/02/24, 1:40 pm - +263 77 485 5312: That would be wonderful madam. Thank you
02/02/24, 1:41 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate!

So Margret, are you aware of Belinda Dube from your school?
02/02/24, 1:42 pm - +263 77 485 5312: Yes ma'am, we were in the  the same class.
02/02/24, 1:44 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

I would like to share with you that recently she became a part of the Edoofa scholarship program after being found eligible and she will be pursuing Law itself, just like yourself!

You can connect with Belinda too to learn more about her journey as well!
02/02/24, 1:45 pm - +263 77 485 5312: Great, thanks so much I will.
02/02/24, 1:45 pm - Harmehak: You're very welcome!
02/02/24, 1:46 pm - Harmehak: Margret, Senior Academician Mr Piyush were in Zimbabwe for about 90 days, from his experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,

While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time. 

This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year. 

Wouldn't you agree to the same?
02/02/24, 1:47 pm - +263 77 485 5312: That's absolutely true.
02/02/24, 1:48 pm - Harmehak: Indeed!

So Margret, I believe by now you would be in a great position to relate how Edoofa is making higher education affordable and accessible for international students in India, isn't it?
02/02/24, 1:49 pm - +263 77 485 5312: That's true.
02/02/24, 1:51 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

Now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program in detail and how it would assist you.
02/02/24, 1:51 pm - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
02/02/24, 1:51 pm - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
02/02/24, 1:51 pm - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

02/02/24, 1:55 pm - +263 77 485 5312: Intriguing.
02/02/24, 1:56 pm - Harmehak: So what's your take on the Earn While You Learn Program, Margret?

Do you believe it would provide you as well as your parents a thorough assistance?
02/02/24, 1:57 pm - +263 77 485 5312: It will be very helpful indeed.
02/02/24, 1:58 pm - Harmehak: I am glad to know that.
02/02/24, 1:58 pm - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $1800 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$600 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $50-$60 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
02/02/24, 1:59 pm - +263 77 485 5312: Thank you very much.
02/02/24, 2:11 pm - Harmehak: You're welcome, Margret.

As of now, would you like to ask anything?
02/02/24, 2:15 pm - +263 77 485 5312: So far, nothing ma'am, as for now l would like to communicate with others who were found eligible for the EDOOFA to share the good works of the organization and to read more from websites you send to me.
02/02/24, 2:16 pm - Harmehak: I am glad to know that you wish to make efforts to learn more, Margret. <This message was edited>
02/02/24, 2:16 pm - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

02/02/24, 2:24 pm - +263 77 485 5312: Yes there's a great difference. I appreciate it greatly.
02/02/24, 2:37 pm - Harmehak: That is great, 

So now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes. 

Are you ready?
02/02/24, 2:48 pm - +263 77 485 5312: Yes ma'am
02/02/24, 2:49 pm - Harmehak: Margret as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
02/02/24, 2:53 pm - +263 77 485 5312: It will cost a minimum of 1500usd and a maximum of 2250usd.
02/02/24, 2:59 pm - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
02/02/24, 2:59 pm - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
02/02/24, 2:59 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
02/02/24, 3:06 pm - +263 77 485 5312: That's great, l have noted the uphill task which Edoofa have done to help us
02/02/24, 3:07 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate.
02/02/24, 3:07 pm - Harmehak: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
02/02/24, 3:09 pm - +263 77 485 5312: That's great.
02/02/24, 3:10 pm - Harmehak: That's amazing, so now that you have understood how Edoofa makes the application process affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
02/02/24, 3:10 pm - Harmehak: Now as you can see, because of such an amazing opportunity that Edoofa provides to its students, Edoofa receives thousands of applications on a  daily basis out of which Eligibility Evaluation takes place as I did share with you above, so only if the student is found eligible for the program and get their Acceptance Letter, *they will have to pay the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Acceptance Letter after which they start with their admission process and the Earn While You Learn Program.*
02/02/24, 3:10 pm - Harmehak: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
02/02/24, 3:14 pm - +263 77 485 5312: Noted thank you ma'am.
02/02/24, 3:15 pm - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
02/02/24, 3:15 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
02/02/24, 3:15 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in their country itself.
02/02/24, 3:15 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
02/02/24, 3:19 pm - +263 77 485 5312: Yes I understand ma'am
02/02/24, 3:26 pm - Harmehak: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
02/02/24, 3:26 pm - Harmehak: Basically, this registration fee ($500-$1000) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024-2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
02/02/24, 3:26 pm - Harmehak: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*

Here is a picture of the Visa of one of the Edoofian who arrived in India, for 2023 Academic Intake.

02/02/24, 3:29 pm - +263 77 485 5312: Noted
02/02/24, 3:34 pm - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
02/02/24, 3:34 pm - Harmehak: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)
02/02/24, 3:34 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
02/02/24, 3:41 pm - +263 77 485 5312: Noted, l have started to engage her
02/02/24, 3:42 pm - Harmehak: That's good!

Do connect your parents with Mrs Ruth as well!
02/02/24, 3:42 pm - +263 77 485 5312: Its ok fine.
02/02/24, 3:44 pm - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
02/02/24, 3:44 pm - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
02/02/24, 3:44 pm - Harmehak: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

It's been a pleasure guiding you through your career sessions.

I believe you must have discussed all the above mentioned points with your family?

I am here to address any questions if they have any.

Are we good to proceed with your application now?
03/02/24, 9:12 am - +263 77 485 5312: Morning how are you doing ma'am, everyone is doing well here.

Yes we can proceed now
03/02/24, 9:13 am - Harmehak: I am doing well please, thank you!
03/02/24, 9:13 am - Harmehak: So how was your discussion with your parents, Margret?

What all did you discuss with them?
03/02/24, 9:17 am - +263 77 485 5312: The discussion went well
We discussed about the advantages of me learning abroad and the archiements I can perform if l manage to study abroad, they understand it well. We discussed about the financial services you offer and they like it. I think that's all in summary.
03/02/24, 9:18 am - Harmehak: I am glad you had a thorough discussion!

So far, what all would you or they like to ask please?
03/02/24, 9:20 am - +263 77 485 5312: I think it will be better if they ask on their own, as for me l don't have questions, l talked to Mrs Ruth she explained a lot an l understand it all
03/02/24, 9:26 am - Harmehak: Duly noted, please!

Thats great, Margret, I am glad you had a thorugh discussion with Mrs Ruth!
03/02/24, 9:26 am - Harmehak: Did you parents happen to connect as well?
03/02/24, 9:30 am - Harmehak: You see, her story is truly remarkable. As a single parent, juggling the responsibilities of a small-scale farmer and the mother of two daughters, she has persevered. Her journey with Edoofa is a testament to how dedicated individuals can overcome obstacles.
Mrs. Ruth's experience with Edoofa is a testament to the transformative impact our programs can have. She not only managed her family's needs but also seized the opportunity for her daughters to achieve higher education. The support and guidance she received from Edoofa were instrumental in her success. The process was challenging, yet incredibly rewarding. Mrs. Ruth's determination, combined with Edoofa's assistance, has paved the way for a brighter future.
03/02/24, 9:35 am - +263 77 485 5312: Yes they did
03/02/24, 9:35 am - Harmehak: Thats great!
03/02/24, 9:36 am - +263 77 485 5312: Yes that's absolutely true ma'am
03/02/24, 9:36 am - Harmehak: Yes please;
03/02/24, 9:36 am - Harmehak: Okay so in that case, I would like to ask you a few questions, but before that with immense pleasure, I would like to share the glimpses of the Africa Visit of our Founders which took place in June 2023! 

*It was a much-awaited event and they were welcomed by Ministries, Educationalists, Edoofians, and Parents across different African Countries. This is a must-watch video depicting the Acceptance of the Program in the African Continent, especially in Zimbabwe!!*
03/02/24, 9:36 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
03/02/24, 9:47 am - +263 77 485 5312: It's looks so great ma'am.
03/02/24, 9:53 am - Harmehak: I would like to share an exciting news that, *We will be visiting Zimbabwe this month to prepare our Edoofians for the journey ahead and we look forward to you being a part of the mega seminar for aspirants.*
03/02/24, 9:54 am - +263 77 485 5312: I promise to be part of the seminar ma'am.
03/02/24, 9:54 am - Harmehak: Thats good, Margret!
03/02/24, 9:56 am - +263 77 349 9806: Jimmy.Margret's father.l have talked to Mrs Magwaza and he shared a good experience with me.She is a hard worker memo.l like the experience even if you get little money from my work as a deputy head
She showed me that with Edoofa you can soldier on.
03/02/24, 9:56 am - +263 77 349 9806: she
03/02/24, 9:56 am - Harmehak: I appreciate your acknowledgement, Mr Jimmy!
03/02/24, 9:57 am - +263 77 349 9806: That's wonderful memo.
03/02/24, 9:57 am - Harmehak: Indeed, Mr Jimmy!
03/02/24, 9:57 am - Harmehak: So far, would you like to ask anything please?
03/02/24, 9:59 am - +263 77 349 9806: The qns that l had especially on air fares have been cleared by Mrs Magwaza memo.
03/02/24, 10:00 am - Harmehak: Alright please!
03/02/24, 10:00 am - Harmehak: If you understand the concept of international education finances that play a major role are not visa fees and flight tickets. The flight ticket is required a very limited number of times as the students don't travel that often. I don't mean to say that students can not go back to their country, they can definitely go back to enjoy the holidays. What I have personally seen is, the students do not travel that often.
So, considering the main finance which plays the most important role in international education is the annual fees. So, to reduce this annual fee, Edoofa helps a student with the Earn While You Learn Program. This program provides the students with an opportunity to earn scholarship credits which in return help them to make their education more affordable.
Visa fees and flight tickets are to be bought just a month before they plan to come to India. So, let's say the student wants to come to India in August 2024, This means that his family has to cater the Visa fee and the ticket in July 2024. If you understand the concept properly, till July 2024, the student will be working in the Earn While You Learn program and will be earning Scholarship credits. Now, with this opportunity, you can save a lot of money on the annual fee which in return helps you to make your flight ticket and the Visa fee affordable.
As mentioned to you already, the scholarship covers the tuition fees as you see, the Edoofa scholarship is basically the scholarship seats acquired from the universities for their good work in the past 14 years in the higher education space. So the travel costs will have to be covered by the student, But our admission team assist you in all the steps. So that you get the cheapest air travel tickets and also easily acquire the visa.
The cost for both the visa and flight cost will be around $350-$490, But you need not worry about that yet as you will be coming to India in the month of July-August this year as per your preparations!
03/02/24, 10:06 am - +263 77 349 9806: That's great madam.l appreciate that.l was wondering on the above matter how madam Magwaza was going through with her two twins.Edoofa is surely a great organization that can take a rural person like my daughter to a greater height if she is successful.
03/02/24, 10:11 am - +263 77 349 9806: In our country if you engaged in Universities you have to buy laptops and stationery.How do they operate in India.
03/02/24, 10:16 am - Harmehak: Yes, Mr Jimmy!
03/02/24, 10:17 am - Harmehak: They are given thorough knowledge by their lecturers itself, and since students have access to internet all the time most of their work is done using mobiles itself!

They have access to fee campus Wifi's as well!
03/02/24, 10:17 am - Harmehak: For the books, we have libraries for the students, please!
03/02/24, 10:18 am - +263 77 349 9806: That's great.
03/02/24, 10:19 am - Harmehak: I appreciate!

*Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage.*
A fact that draws our attention is that, according to his position in life, an extravagant man is either admired or loathed. A successful business man does nothing to increase his popularity by being prudent with his money. A person who is wealthy is expected to lead a luxurious life and to be lavish with his hospitality. If he is not so, he is considered mean, and his reputation in business may even suffer in consequence. The paradox remains that he had not been careful with his money in the first place; he would never have achieved his present wealth.
Among the low income group, a different set of values exists. The young clerk, who makes his wife a present of a new dress when he has not paid his house rent, is condemned as extravagant. Carefulness with money to the point of meanness is applauded as a virtue. Nothing in his life is considered more worthy than paying his bills. The ideal wife for such a man separates her housekeeping money into joyless little piles – so much for rent, for food, for the children’s shoes, she is able to face the milkman with equanimity every, month satisfied with her economizing ways , and never knows the guilt of buying something she can’t really afford .
As for myself, I fall neither of these categories. If I have money to spare I can be extravagant, but when, as is usually the case, I am hard up and then I am the meanest man imaginable.

1. Which of the following would be the most appropriate title for the passage
a)The cause of poverty is extravagance.
b)Stingy habits of the poor.
c)Being extravagant is always condemnable.
d)Extravagance is a part of the rich as well as of the poor.

2.According to the passage the person, who is a successful businessman and wealthy
a)Is more popular if he appears to be wasting away his time.
b)Is expected to have lavish lifestyle.
c)Must be extravagant before achieving success.
d)Should not bother about popularity.

3. The phrase ‘lavish with his hospitality’ in the third sentence of the first paragraph means
a)Extravagance in entertaining guest.
b)Unconcerned in treating his friends and relatives.
c)Thoughtful in spending only on guests and strangers.
d)Stinginess in dealing with his relatives.

4.The word ‘paradox’ in the last sentence of the first paragraph means
a)A word that brings out the hidden meaning
b)Statement based on facts
c)a statement that seems self-contradictory but in reality expresses a possible truth.
d)Statement based on the popular opinion

5.What is the meaning of the word “equanimity”?
a)Calmness
b)Discomposure
c)Equivocal

Whey to Go Greek yogurt—a strained form of cultured yogurt—has grown enormously in popularity in the United States since it was first introduced in the country in the late 1980s. From 2011 to 2012 alone, sales of Greek yogurt in the US increased by 50 percent. The resulting increase in Greek yogurt production has forced those involved in the business to address the detrimental effects that the yogurt-making process may be having on the environment. Fortunately, farmers and others in the Greek yogurt business have found many methods of controlling and eliminating most environmental threats. Given these solutions as well as the many health benefits of the food, the advantages of Greek yogurt Q5. outdo the potential drawbacks of its production.Sentence [1] The main environmental problem caused by the production of Greek yogurt is the creation of acid whey as a by-product.Sentence [2] Because it requires up to four times more milk to make than conventional yogurt does, Greek yogurt produces larger amounts of acid whey, which is difficult to dispose of.Sentence [3] To address the problem of disposal, farmers have found a number of uses for acid whey. Sentence[4] They can add it to livestock feed as a protein Q.6. supplement, and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt.Sentence[5] If it is improperly introduced into the environment, acid-whey runoff Q.7. can pollute waterways, depleting the oxygen content of streams and rivers as it decomposes. Sentence [6] Yogurt manufacturers, food Q.8. scientists; and government officials are also working together to develop additional solutions for reusing whey.

6.supplement, and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt.
A) NO CHANGE
B) supplement and convert it into gas to use as fuel in electricity production.

03/02/24, 11:11 am - Harmehak: All the best, Margret!
03/02/24, 12:41 pm - +263 77 485 5312: Section 5 "It is true that many Africans have poor diets, and this is partially due to the stagnation of agriculture in many regions of the continent. This problem has a variety of causes, including a lack of access to resources, knowledge, and infrastructure. Access to resources is a major issue in many areas of Africa, where farmers may lack the necessary land, capital, or water for farming. Additionally, many farmers lack the knowledge and resources to implement modern agricultural techniques and technologies that could improve yields. Finally, infrastructure is often lacking in rural areas, making it difficult to transport and distribute food.

The lack of access to resources is a major issue for many African farmers. Land is often scarce, and the land that is available may be of poor quality. In addition, farmers may not have access to the necessary capital to invest in equipment, seeds, or fertilizers. This can lead to low yields and poor harvests, leading to food insecurity for the farmers and their families. Similarly, water scarcity is a major problem, with many farmers relying on rainfall for irrigation. This can lead to crops failing due to drought or flooding. 

Moreso lack of resources, a lack of knowledge is another major factor contributing to food insecurity in Africa. Many farmers have not been exposed to modern agricultural techniques and technologies that could help them to increase their yields. For example, some farmers may not be aware of the benefits of using improved seeds, using fertilizers correctly, or practicing crop rotation. Additionally, many farmers may not have access to extension services, which can provide information and support to help farmers improve their farming practices. This lack of knowledge can lead to continued low yields and poor nutrition for the farmers and their families

In addition to a lack of resources and knowledge, the lack of infrastructure is another major factor contributing to food insecurity in Africa. Many rural areas do not have access to roads, making it difficult to transport food from farms to markets or to get agricultural inputs like seeds and fertilizers to farmers. Additionally, many areas lack access to clean water, electricity, or communications infrastructure, making it difficult to access important information or obtain the basic necessities for survival. This lack of infrastructure can lead to higher prices for food and other goods, making it difficult for people to afford to eat a nutritious diet.

In addition to the factors discussed above, there are a number of other factors that can contribute to food insecurity in Africa. These include conflict, political instability, climate change, and poor governance. Conflict can disrupt farming activities, making it difficult for farmers to grow and sell their crops. Political instability can lead to economic instability, making it difficult for farmers to plan for the future. Climate change is leading to more frequent and severe droughts and floods, making it difficult for farmers to grow crops. And poor governance can lead to corruption and mismanagement of resources, making it difficult to address the issue of food.

 To conclude, food insecurity in Africa is a complex and multifaceted issue, with a number of factors contributing to the problem. These factors include a lack of access to resources, knowledge, and infrastructure. Additionally, conflict, political instability, climate change, and poor governance can all exacerbate the problem. It is important to address these underlying issues in order to improve food security in Africa. This will require a holistic approach, involving a range of actors, including governments, international organizations, and local communities. By working together, it is possible to make progress on this important issue.

"Rose the Singer" - An Inspirational Story of Hope and Resilience.

Once upon a time, in a small village in Africa, there lived a young girl named Rose. Rose was known throughout the village for her beautiful singing voice, but she was too shy to sing in front of others. One day, the village was hit by a severe drought, and the crops began to fail. Rose's family was in danger of starving, and the village was desperate for help.
In a moment of bravery, Rose began to sing at the village market. Her voice filled the air, and people stopped what they were doing.

As Rose sang, the villagers began to gather around her. Her voice was so beautiful and her song so moving that they forgot about their troubles for a moment. When she finished singing, the villagers were in tears, and they begged her to sing again. This time, Rose found the courage to sing a song of hope and resilience, and the villagers felt their spirits lift. Rose's song inspired the villagers to work together to find a way to survive the drought. And Rose learned that her voice could be a powerful tool for bringing hope and strength to others.
Rose's bravery and resilience in the face of adversity is an inspiration to us.

 For generations to come, Rose's story has been passed down in the village. In times of hardship, the villagers remember Rose's song of hope and resilience. They remember how, in a moment of courage, she changed the course of their future. Rose's legacy lives on as a reminder that even in the darkest of times, we can find strength and hope through art and music. Rose's story is a powerful testament to the human spirit and our ability to overcome adversity. May we all find the courage to sing our own song of hope, no matter what challenges we face.
And so it is said that when the villagers are feeling.

And so, Rose's story reminds us that even in the darkest of times, a song of hope and resilience can change the world. Art and music can bring us together and give us the strength to overcome any obstacle. As Rose's legacy shows, the human spirit is strong and unbreakable, and we can use our gifts to make a difference in the lives of others. So let us all sing our own song, and create a better future for ourselves and those around us. Let us all be inspired by Rose's story and find the courage to make our voices heard.
Rose's story lives on, inspiring us to be brave
03/02/24, 1:04 pm - Harmehak: Received please!

Let me get it evaluated!
03/02/24, 1:05 pm - +263 77 485 5312: Ok thank you ma'am
03/02/24, 1:07 pm - Harmehak: You're welcome, Margret
03/02/24, 6:24 pm - Harmehak: Good Evening Margret!

Now, while I have submitted your test for evaluation, I have your interview slots, however before I shared the interview slots I would like you and your parents as well to answer a few of my questions.

So I wanted to ask that for the same, so could you and your parent be online for the next 20 minutes to answer my question?
03/02/24, 6:38 pm - +263 77 485 5312: Yes ma'am, we can proceed
03/02/24, 6:39 pm - Harmehak: Sure Margret!

Mr Jimmy, I believe you must have followed the entire discussion so far!

So, now given the finances and the entire details of the program, I would like to know if you are willing to support Margret's higher education in India both mentally and financially please?

If so, kindly acknowledge using a voice note!
03/02/24, 6:43 pm - +263 77 349 9806: <Media omitted>
03/02/24, 6:43 pm - Harmehak: Well received please, you see as per my experience over the last couple of years, I have been fortunate to have assisted over hundreds of students in achieving their career aspiration through the Edoofa Program. 

One of my key observations during helping out these students was regarding what was the common trait amongst students who are today having the best of their time in India through the Edoofa Program, and honestly I was able to come down to only one aspect that is FAMILY SUPPORT.
03/02/24, 6:43 pm - Harmehak: You see in this journey of any child's higher education, there are three major contributors 

1. Student himself/herself
2. FAMILY
3. EDOOFA PROGAM

Now all the students who are today successfully a part of the Edoofa Program, had all these three contributors working together towards the common goal which is student's success and ensuring that by the time student completes his/her higher education they should be able to get good paying jobs. 

Even if any one of the contributor does not perform to the best of their abilities, Student's overall success is hampered. Let me give you a few examples

*In the event if student wishes to work hard, Edoofa is willing to support but the Family is not willing to support, the student will not be successful under the program*

*In the event if student wishes to work hard, Family is willing to support, but Edoofa's academic Board doesn't find the student worthy, the student will not be successful under the program*

*In the event if Family is willing to support, Edoofa's Academic Board is willing to support but the student doesn't wishes to work hard, then also the student will not be successful under the program*
03/02/24, 6:43 pm - Harmehak: During the evaluation of your child's application so far, the Academic Board has evaluated a few aspects, such as student's willingness to work hard, and family's willingness to support the student so that the student can achieve what he/she has aspired. However now in your interview ahead, the Academic Board would be strictly be evaluating the Family's support towards the child higher education. 

*As you know in the event if your child is found eligible, you would have to complete a certain part of the formalities within the 7 day timeline, so may I know regarding the same, are you willing to support your child to the fullest?*
03/02/24, 6:47 pm - +263 77 349 9806: <Media omitted>
03/02/24, 6:49 pm - Harmehak: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
03/02/24, 6:49 pm - Harmehak: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
03/02/24, 6:49 pm - Harmehak: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.
03/02/24, 6:49 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
03/02/24, 6:49 pm - Harmehak: Ideally as you know, the tentative dates:

1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 11th or 12th February 2024 for $200 and the 11th or 12th of March for the remaining $150.

2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 11th or 12th February 2024. 

Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?
03/02/24, 6:55 pm - +263 77 349 9806: <Media omitted>
03/02/24, 6:58 pm - Harmehak: I do understand, Mr Jimmy and appreciate your acknowledgement!

03/02/24, 7:04 pm - +263 77 349 9806: <Media omitted>
