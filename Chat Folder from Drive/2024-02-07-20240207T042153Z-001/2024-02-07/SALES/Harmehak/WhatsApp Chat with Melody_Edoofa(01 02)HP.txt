01/02/24, 9:26 am - Harmehak: I appreciate your noble thoughts to do well for others, Melody!

So what all did you research regarding the degree in Zimbabwe or in India?

What is your learning so far?
01/02/24, 9:34 am - +263 78 042 6776: Currently I did a research in Zimbabwe about community development. 

And I had learnd that there are many people suffering from poverty and they are also vulnerable. These people also face many challenges in their daily living be it conflicts and diseases
01/02/24, 9:35 am - Harmehak: I completely understand Melody!

I am glad that you are making researches and willing to put efforts as well!
01/02/24, 9:38 am - +263 78 042 6776: Thank you Ms Harmehak
01/02/24, 9:38 am - Harmehak: Let me provide you a better clarity regarding your desired course.
01/02/24, 9:40 am - Harmehak: Now let me help you have a better understanding, social work is a great course at the current time. From my personal experience of being in the field of education, I see many students apply for the course, but being a very niche course, a lot of universities don't offer the same because the cost of the course is very high and since it's a practical course, and the ones who do they don't offer scholarships on the course as the investment to teach such a course to a number of students becomes very high for the university as well. 

Now usually what students do is, that they pursue a course that is similar to this particular course. A student can do all the related jobs without a degree of social work. A lot of time students pursue a course called Bachelor of Sociology. The base of this course and the base of social work as a course in similar in nature which is why students who pursue this course end up having career opportunities in the field of social work!
01/02/24, 9:40 am - Harmehak: Social work and sociology have many similarities when it comes to career aspirations. For both professions, the main goal is to work with individuals, families, and communities to improve the quality of life and promote positive change. Both social work and sociology focus on understanding the causes of social problems and developing strategies to address them.

Social workers and sociologists use similar skills and approaches to help people, including interviewing, counseling, advocating, and providing support and resources. They also draw on research methods and theories to inform their practice and shape their interventions. For example, sociologists may conduct research on a particular population to gain a better understanding of how their environment, culture, and other factors influence their behavior and quality of life. This knowledge can then be applied to the development of social policy and change initiatives.

Both social workers and sociologists also strive to create a more equitable and just society. They recognize the importance of understanding and appreciating diversity, as well as the need to challenge oppression, discrimination, and social injustice. They work together to create an environment that values and respects all people, regardless of race, gender, class, or other factors.

Overall, social work and sociology have similar goals and approaches to promoting positive change. They both recognize the importance of understanding the root causes of social problems and developing strategies to address them. They also strive to create a more equitable and just society by challenging oppression, discrimination, and social injustice.
01/02/24, 9:40 am - Harmehak: You can go through the same and inform me please
01/02/24, 9:49 am - +263 78 042 6776: I have read the essay,it is clarified and I  have understood it
01/02/24, 9:54 am - Harmehak: That's great!

Melody, can you please share what all did you understand in your own wording?
01/02/24, 10:07 am - +263 78 042 6776: I have read that currently it's  a bit challenging doing Social work because it  is costly in some Universities bt instead students are pursuing in Bachelor of Sociology because Social work and Sociology are similar in nature.And also that these two courses have similar skills in helping the community to have an equal     
Society and a just community
01/02/24, 10:08 am - Harmehak: That's very correct and well put across, Melody!

So now shall I brief you about Bachelors in Sociology?
01/02/24, 10:09 am - +263 78 042 6776: Yes I would like to know more about Bachelor in Sociology

01/02/24, 12:00 pm - Harmehak: I do understand and equally appreciate your efforts to look out for a better future!

Now as you know Edoofa Recommends India as a Higher Education destination.

*May I know what is your knowledge or what have you researched about India and Indian Education System which makes you feel that studying in India would help you achieve your dreams?*
01/02/24, 12:06 pm - +263 78 042 6776: I haven't researched enough yet bt from my researches i found out that India has the best tutors for both practicals and theory
01/02/24, 12:26 pm - Harmehak: Alright please, let me add to it, you see over the past 6 years, the Edoofa Scholarship Program is only focused in India, because of the following reasons:

01/02/24, 12:49 pm - Harmehak: You're very welcome!

So what all did you learn regarding Tadiwanashe's acceptance into the program, Melody?

Did you happen to follow his process or have a discussion to learn more?
01/02/24, 1:01 pm - +263 78 042 6776: I was following when Tadiwanashe started applying for Edoofa Scholarship and I got interested.Also I was still following on the process when I applied and the response came whilst I am still researching
01/02/24, 1:03 pm - Harmehak: It's good to know that you made efforts on your end, Melody!
01/02/24, 1:03 pm - Harmehak: So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
01/02/24, 1:11 pm - +263 78 042 6776: It's about $6000_8000
01/02/24, 1:12 pm - Harmehak: Very correct!
01/02/24, 1:12 pm - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
01/02/24, 1:12 pm - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
01/02/24, 1:12 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
01/02/24, 1:19 pm - +263 78 042 6776: Thank you
01/02/24, 1:20 pm - Harmehak: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $2000-3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, 

Now *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
01/02/24, 1:21 pm - Harmehak: So what is your knowledge of the Earn While You Learn Program, Melody?
01/02/24, 1:32 pm - +263 78 042 6776: This scheme enables students to show case their hidden talents with the help from their teachers to work either in organization and get paid whilst they are learning
01/02/24, 1:33 pm - Harmehak: Alright please,

However it's a program, Melody!
01/02/24, 1:33 pm - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
01/02/24, 1:33 pm - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
01/02/24, 1:37 pm - +263 78 042 6776: Thank you so much
01/02/24, 1:39 pm - Harmehak: You're very welcome, Melody!
01/02/24, 1:39 pm - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

01/02/24, 1:49 pm - +263 78 042 6776: Yes am grad to know about the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa
01/02/24, 1:57 pm - Harmehak: That's wonderful!

So far, would you like to ask anything, Melody?
01/02/24, 2:02 pm - +263 78 042 6776: For now I don't have anything to ask .Thank you
01/02/24, 2:13 pm - Harmehak: Alright please
01/02/24, 2:13 pm - Harmehak: So what all did you learn about the enrollment stage from Tadiwanashe, Melody?
01/02/24, 2:29 pm - +263 78 042 6776: I learned that learning through Edoofa is possible and that you get the chance to express your opinions through the interview
01/02/24, 2:31 pm - Harmehak: That is great, 

So Melody, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes. 

Are you ready?
01/02/24, 2:32 pm - +263 78 042 6776: Yes am ready
01/02/24, 2:32 pm - Harmehak: Melody, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
01/02/24, 2:32 pm - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
01/02/24, 2:34 pm - +263 78 042 6776: $1,500.00
01/02/24, 2:39 pm - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
01/02/24, 2:39 pm - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
01/02/24, 2:41 pm - +263 78 042 6776: Okay
01/02/24, 3:01 pm - Harmehak: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
01/02/24, 3:05 pm - +263 78 042 6776: Yes I do think so
01/02/24, 3:06 pm - Harmehak: That's amazing, so now that you have understood how Edoofa makes the application process affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
01/02/24, 3:06 pm - Harmehak: Now as you can see, because of such an amazing opportunity that Edoofa provides to its students, Edoofa receives thousands of applications on a  daily basis out of which Eligibility Evaluation takes place as I did share with you above, so only if the student is found eligible for the program and get their Acceptance Letter, *they will have to pay the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Acceptance Letter after which they start with their admission process and the Earn While You Learn Program.*
01/02/24, 3:06 pm - Harmehak: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
01/02/24, 3:11 pm - +263 78 042 6776: Okay noted
01/02/24, 3:11 pm - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
01/02/24, 3:11 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
01/02/24, 3:11 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in their country itself.
01/02/24, 3:11 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
01/02/24, 3:15 pm - +263 78 042 6776: Yes I do understand
01/02/24, 3:22 pm - Harmehak: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
01/02/24, 3:22 pm - Harmehak: Basically, this registration fee ($500-$1000) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024-2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
01/02/24, 3:22 pm - Harmehak: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
