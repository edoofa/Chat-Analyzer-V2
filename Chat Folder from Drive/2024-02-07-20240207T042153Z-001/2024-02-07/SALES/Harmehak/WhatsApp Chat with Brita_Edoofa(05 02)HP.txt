05/02/24, 11:00 am - +263 78 530 9052: Okay okay  understood
05/02/24, 11:09 am - Harmehak: *Alright so Brita, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.*

I would like to know you better as a student so please go ahead, tell me a bit about yourself, your education, how much USD Chiwara high school charges you every term, along with what do you wish to study, your strengths and weaknesses, and your hobbies, since I honestly don't know a lot about you?

And with that a detailed description of your family background, what do your parents do *(Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work)?*, what is their highest education level along with if you have any siblings, please?
05/02/24, 2:05 pm - Harmehak: I am expecting your response, Brita!
05/02/24, 2:46 pm - +263 78 530 9052: Okay Okay, I'm a girl aged 19 turning 20 this year I've studied at Chiwara High school and finished my O level there paying $60 as for my school fees every term. I wish to be studying  biotechnology at Edoofa and this has always been my dream to get a chance to study biotechnology at Edoofa. I find my strength and passion in learning more about living organisms and medicine. As for my weakness is self-criticism. My favorite hobbies are reading and debating 


My family is a family that put education first above all and teaches respect and love between one another, my dad is a construction worker and my mother is a nurse they both finished their highschool and are both  graduates,  my older brother also finished his O level and advanced to A level and is now working as a self employed worker
05/02/24, 2:50 pm - Harmehak: Well received and well expressed Brita, Its a pleasure to know about you and your family!

I appreciate the honesty and transparency you have shown in expressing yourself!
05/02/24, 2:50 pm - Harmehak: May I know the reason behind the delayed response please?
05/02/24, 2:59 pm - +263 78 530 9052: Thank you
05/02/24, 3:02 pm - +263 78 530 9052: Where I was the network was totally bad so I had to find a better place with good network connection to have better communication
05/02/24, 3:20 pm - Harmehak: I do understand please!
05/02/24, 3:21 pm - Harmehak: Well Brita now as we proceed ahead, I would like to your thoughts on higher education abroad!

Do you believe it's a life changing decision?
05/02/24, 3:21 pm - +263 78 530 9052: Okay thank you
05/02/24, 3:23 pm - Harmehak: You're welcome!
05/02/24, 3:23 pm - +263 78 530 9052: Indeed it is a life changing decision for me and it has always been my dream to study abroad
05/02/24, 3:24 pm - Harmehak: Thats good, Brita!

So would you add that you are mentally prepared for a life abroad too?
05/02/24, 3:28 pm - +263 78 530 9052: Yes I'm  more than ready and prepared for a life abroad and ready to adapt to the new environment as well
05/02/24, 3:30 pm - Harmehak: Britta, I am delighted to see your dedication and I believe you would agree with me that commitment from your parents is equally important!

So now could you please share, if your family members are aware of your plans to study abroad and if they are willing to support your higher education abroad mentally and financially?
05/02/24, 3:33 pm - +263 78 530 9052: Yes it is really important and I can  assure you that they are fully aware of my plans to study abroad and they are more than willing to support my higher education abroad mentally and physically
05/02/24, 3:34 pm - Harmehak: Thats great, are they willing support financially too?
05/02/24, 3:36 pm - +263 78 530 9052: Yes they are
05/02/24, 3:39 pm - Harmehak: Alright please!
05/02/24, 3:39 pm - Harmehak: Could you please share your O level results with me?
05/02/24, 3:40 pm - +263 78 530 9052: <Media omitted>
05/02/24, 3:40 pm - +263 78 530 9052: Okay okay
05/02/24, 3:51 pm - Harmehak: Received please!
05/02/24, 3:51 pm - Harmehak: So what motivates you to study Biotechnology, Britta?

I believe you must be aware that you would be pursuing Diploma itself?
05/02/24, 4:04 pm - +263 78 530 9052: I've always had a passion for studying more about life science and Biotechnology is amongst the most recession-proof professions in the current times. 

So, it offers job security. The field of study teaches knowledge and skills that enable one to handle unexpected situations and come up with solutions for societal improvement and it also provides the opportunity to learn about the biological sciences, study the basic and advanced techniques of research, learn to apply experimental methods and analytical procedures, and understand the applications and uses of biotechnology itself
05/02/24, 4:06 pm - +263 78 530 9052: Yes I'm fully aware that I will be pursuing Diploma
05/02/24, 4:29 pm - Harmehak: I am glad to know of your thoughts, Brita!
05/02/24, 4:29 pm - Harmehak: Alright please, however why didn't you pursue A level please?
05/02/24, 4:39 pm - +263 78 530 9052: I never really pictured myself going to A level as I've always wanted to get a diploma first then a degree
05/02/24, 4:39 pm - Harmehak: I can understand Brita!
05/02/24, 4:40 pm - Harmehak: What all did you research regarding your desired course, Brita?
05/02/24, 4:50 pm - +263 78 530 9052: Okay I've also researched  that Biotechnology is an interdisciplinary subject that covers topics such as biochemistry, cell biology, genetics, molecular biology, chemical engineering and robotics too and that 
Most of the classes I  will take in biotechnology  may involve laboratory work, along with analyzing biological research
05/02/24, 4:52 pm - +263 78 530 9052: And that it needs a lot of hard working and determination
05/02/24, 5:39 pm - Harmehak: I am glad you did research, Brita!
05/02/24, 5:39 pm - Harmehak: Brita, as you know you would as of now have to pursue a Diploma first and then you could venture into Bachelor,

I personally believe that pursuing a *Diploma in Medical Laboratory Technology* would be the right opportunity for you. SInce with this, you are laying a solid foundation for your future in the realm of life sciences. This program equips you with essential skills and knowledge in laboratory techniques, a crucial aspect of the broader field of biotechnology. Even though you haven't pursued Advanced Level education, this diploma serves as an excellent stepping stone toward your passion for biotechnology.

Upon completion of your Diploma in Medical Laboratory Technology, you'll not only have a strong understanding of laboratory practices but also the practical experience necessary for the intricate work involved in biotechnology. Many aspects of laboratory technology are directly applicable to biotechnological research and development.

Consider your diploma as the initial phase of your journey. Subsequently, when you pursue your Bachelor's, you can specialize in Biotechnology, building upon the foundational knowledge gained during your diploma. This pathway will not only allow you to enter the biotechnology field but also position you advantageously with practical insights gained from your hands-on experience in laboratory technology. It's a strategic route that aligns with your passion and offers a promising trajectory toward advancements in the exciting and recession-proof field of Biotechnology.
05/02/24, 5:47 pm - +263 78 530 9052: Yes yes very true
05/02/24, 5:54 pm - Harmehak: Indeed, so let me brief you about Diploma in Medical Laboratory Technology.
05/02/24, 5:54 pm - Harmehak: *Diploma in Medical Lab Technology*

05/02/24, 6:16 pm - Harmehak: That is really great Brita, I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations!

Now, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
05/02/24, 6:26 pm - +263 78 530 9052: I would like to study abroad and not in my country because  according to my researching I've seen that India have  the best obtained grades in studying biotechnology than here in my country and I would love to acquire deep understanding to inter culture

Now as you know Edoofa Recommends India as a Higher Education destination.

*May I know what is your knowledge or what have you researched about India and Indian Education System which makes you feel that studying in India would help you achieve your dreams?*
05/02/24, 6:40 pm - Harmehak changed the group name from "Brita_Edoofa(01/02)HP" to "Brita_Edoofa(05/02)HP"
05/02/24, 6:52 pm - +263 78 530 9052: Well according to some of my researching  Indian schools prioritize character building and values education, instilling qualities such as discipline, respect, integrity, and empathy in students. These values shape their moral compass and equip them with essential life skills.
The cost of tuition fees, accommodation, and other expenses is much lower in Indian universities than in foreign universities. This makes it a popular choice for students who want to pursue higher education but are on a tight budget. It is also one of the most strongest educational systems in the world with prominent people like the owner of Google coming being Indian and even the prime minister of Britain being Indian and not forgetting the owner of Microsoft who are all Indian meaning to say they have had the best education in India. It also have the best medical schools and most pharmaceutical shops in Zimbabwe, Zambia or Zimbabwe are owned by Indians and this all inspires me to study in India as it will surely help me to achieve my dreams
05/02/24, 6:56 pm - Harmehak: I am delighted to know of your knowledge and thorough research, Brita!
05/02/24, 6:57 pm - Harmehak: Alright please, let me add to it, you see over the past 6 years, the Edoofa Scholarship Program is only focused in India, because of the following reasons:

05/02/24, 7:45 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate please.
05/02/24, 7:45 pm - Harmehak: I would have loved to continue, however now I would be scheduling your session for *tomorrow at 9:30 AM CAT*, as my working hours for the day are over and it's already been a long day.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
05/02/24, 7:45 pm - Harmehak: Do go through the shared video to learn more about the experiences of our Proud Edoofians!
05/02/24, 7:45 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
05/02/24, 7:57 pm - +263 78 530 9052: Okay okay
06/02/24, 9:33 am - +263 78 530 9052: Good morning Ms Harmehak
06/02/24, 9:34 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
06/02/24, 9:34 am - +263 78 530 9052: Yes I'm doing well, we can start
06/02/24, 9:35 am - Harmehak: So were you able to go through the shared video?
06/02/24, 9:37 am - +263 78 530 9052: Yes I was and it's quite interesting
06/02/24, 9:38 am - Harmehak: Thats great!
06/02/24, 9:38 am - Harmehak: I am glad this intrigued you and you found it helpful!

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
06/02/24, 9:50 am - +263 78 530 9052: Yes I've looked into some higher education for international students without any scholarship in India and discovered that there would be much more expenses than one with a scholarship like in Parul University or Dheli University and I find Edoofa being much more favorable in terms of scholarships
06/02/24, 9:52 am - Harmehak: While I understand what you are sharing, did you happen to research about Parul University?
06/02/24, 9:55 am - +263 78 530 9052: Yes I have but not much
06/02/24, 9:55 am - Harmehak: It is quite unfortunate to hear about that, since Edoofa is associated with some of the finest and the most resourceful universities in India, we are partnered up with more than 250+ Universities in India but we are not associated with Parul University because of a reason.
06/02/24, 9:55 am - Harmehak: The reason being Parul University isn't ranked under NIRF and the degrees offered by them are not recognized on a global level, it is because the founders are accused of rape. 

When we know all this about the university and the management working there, there is no way we can ever think of partnering with such universities and sending our students over there. 

For your reference, I am sharing the link to the news with you so that you can check the same for yourself.

06/02/24, 9:55 am - Harmehak: Infact in many places in India the degree won't' be valid as well!
06/02/24, 9:58 am - +263 78 530 9052: Okay okay I understand
06/02/24, 9:59 am - +263 78 530 9052: Okay okay
06/02/24, 9:59 am - Harmehak: Alright please!
06/02/24, 9:59 am - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
06/02/24, 9:59 am - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
06/02/24, 9:59 am - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
06/02/24, 9:59 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
06/02/24, 10:07 am - +263 78 530 9052: Okay I can see that the Edoofa program makes it easier fr students and also makes education   affordable through employability
06/02/24, 10:20 am - Harmehak: I appreciate!
06/02/24, 10:20 am - Harmehak: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $2000-3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, 

Now *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

What are you thoughts on the same please?
06/02/24, 10:25 am - +263 78 530 9052: I think the opportunity given for  students to reduce their remaining annual fees as as much as they can through earn while you learn program is really helpful  because it also offers students to get a chance to purchase some personal necessities of their own
06/02/24, 10:28 am - +263 78 530 9052: And also helps parents to pay less making it much more affordable
06/02/24, 10:32 am - Harmehak: I am glad you are thorough following the entire discussion and you do understand!
06/02/24, 10:33 am - Harmehak: That's great,

Now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program in detail and how it would assist you.
06/02/24, 10:33 am - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
06/02/24, 10:33 am - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
06/02/24, 10:33 am - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

06/02/24, 11:00 am - +263 78 530 9052: Okay I understand and can see that most students develop helpful skills through the EWYL Program becoming more and more creative  and it also collaborates in helping to reduce fees on parents I'm also glad that it sets up students for the 21st-century job opportunities so that one is already set up to get into the field and work without any problem of wanting to adjust to what is happening. It also seems to provide personal growth making one much more confident in doing a job or task
06/02/24, 11:05 am - Harmehak: I thoroughly appreciate your understanding Brita and that's surely very correct!
06/02/24, 11:05 am - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
06/02/24, 11:19 am - +263 78 530 9052: I'm equally impressed that I can do EWYL program and it will be a good feeling to know that I have contributed something for my education and I'm fully prepared to work as hard as I can to earn more  to help pay of the scholarship and help my parents pay less
06/02/24, 11:25 am - Harmehak: I admire your dedication and commitment, Brita!
06/02/24, 11:26 am - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

06/02/24, 11:41 am - +263 78 530 9052: Oooh I didn't realize that you are in your own league and so far I've not heard if there are any other organizations that can match you because already I feel like I can do the best that I can for my own education and would also want to be able to pay my whole fees through the EWYL program through Edoofa so I really do wish I get the opportunity to be part of this amazing program
06/02/24, 11:44 am - Harmehak: I am delighted to know of your dedicated thoughts to do well along with the same I appreciate your kind words!
06/02/24, 11:44 am - Harmehak: That is great, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes. 

Are you ready?
06/02/24, 11:46 am - +263 78 530 9052: Yes I'm ready
06/02/24, 11:47 am - Harmehak: Brita as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
06/02/24, 11:47 am - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
06/02/24, 11:53 am - +263 78 530 9052: It could  cost the student about $1500-$2250
06/02/24, 11:53 am - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
06/02/24, 11:53 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
06/02/24, 11:53 am - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
06/02/24, 11:57 am - +263 78 530 9052: Okay okay I understand, making it much more affordable
06/02/24, 11:58 am - Harmehak: Yes please!
06/02/24, 11:58 am - Harmehak: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
06/02/24, 12:03 pm - +263 78 530 9052: Yes I agree, Edoofa is making a great impact in helping admission process for international students and seems to be one of the best
06/02/24, 12:05 pm - Harmehak: That's amazing, so now that you have understood how Edoofa makes the application process affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
06/02/24, 12:05 pm - Harmehak: Now as you can see, because of such an amazing opportunity that Edoofa provides to its students, Edoofa receives thousands of applications on a  daily basis out of which Eligibility Evaluation takes place as I did share with you above, so only if the student is found eligible for the program and get their Acceptance Letter, *they will have to pay the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Acceptance Letter after which they start with their admission process and the Earn While You Learn Program.*
06/02/24, 12:05 pm - Harmehak: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
06/02/24, 12:09 pm - +263 78 530 9052: Okay I understand, this is great
06/02/24, 12:09 pm - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
06/02/24, 12:09 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
06/02/24, 12:09 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in their country itself.
06/02/24, 12:09 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
06/02/24, 12:15 pm - +263 78 530 9052: Yes yes I understand
06/02/24, 12:15 pm - Harmehak: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
06/02/24, 12:15 pm - Harmehak: Basically, this registration fee ($500-$1000) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024-2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
06/02/24, 12:15 pm - Harmehak: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*

Here is a picture of the Visa of one of the Edoofian who arrived in India, for 2023 Academic Intake.

06/02/24, 12:19 pm - +263 78 530 9052: Okay I understand
06/02/24, 12:24 pm - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
06/02/24, 12:24 pm - Harmehak: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)

06/02/24, 12:25 pm - +263 78 530 9052: Okay thank you
06/02/24, 12:26 pm - Harmehak: So far, do you have any queries for me Brita?
06/02/24, 12:35 pm - +263 78 530 9052: Wow they are indeed very excited
06/02/24, 12:36 pm - +263 78 530 9052: I've talked to her and she explained a few important facts
06/02/24, 12:36 pm - +263 78 530 9052: Not at all
06/02/24, 12:36 pm - Harmehak: Alright please!
06/02/24, 12:39 pm - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
06/02/24, 12:39 pm - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
06/02/24, 12:39 pm - Harmehak: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

06/02/24, 1:05 pm - +263 78 530 9052: Ooh wonderful, I'd love to be part of the mega seminar
