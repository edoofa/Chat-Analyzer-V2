02/02/24, 1:33 pm - +263 78 404 6865: I want to study abroad coz i need to see different things in life soo i wont be able to see much if i stay in my home country
02/02/24, 1:46 pm - Harmehak: You see, Tafataona, Senior Academician Mr. Piyush was in Zimbabwe for about 90 days. He had the privilege of meeting many Zimbabwean students who had applied for the Edoofa Program back in 2018-2019. However, at that time, they didn't proceed because they were enticed by the prospect of earning quick money in the country. This year, when they met him, they shared how difficult things have been for them. Some of them, despite holding reputed degrees from UZ, MSU, and HIT, are working as petrol attendants, while others have started careers as mobile/laptop repair technicians. Some were facing even more challenges, resorting to selling Ecocash, Simcards, or vegetables.

Observing this scenario, Mr. Piyush saw many of them regretting not seizing the opportunity when they had the chance. So, what you are sharing, I can understand that, in reality, things are much more challenging over there.
02/02/24, 1:58 pm - +263 78 404 6865: Its difficult over here as those students sayed and it be much difficult if i persue my higher education here in Zimbabwe
02/02/24, 2:11 pm - Harmehak: I completely understand, however I am glad you are making efforts for a promising future, Tafataona.

Now as you know Edoofa Recommends India as a Higher Education destination.

*May I know what is your knowledge or what have you researched about India and Indian Education System which makes you feel that studying in India would help you achieve your dreams?*
02/02/24, 2:21 pm - +263 78 404 6865: Studying in India would help me achieve my dreams because studying in India would give me more chances of  being employed anywhere without struggles
02/02/24, 2:34 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate
02/02/24, 2:34 pm - Harmehak: Alright please, let me add to it, you see over the past 6 years, the Edoofa Scholarship Program is only focused in India, because of the following reasons:

02/02/24, 2:44 pm - Harmehak: Did you thoroughly follow the shared resources, Tafataona?

If so, how do you believe studying in India will help you build a promising future?
02/02/24, 2:55 pm - +263 78 404 6865: Sorry im still going through them
02/02/24, 2:59 pm - +263 78 404 6865: Studying in India will help me build a promising future because it has quality education and research meaning in India I'll be among the bests and I'll learn the best
02/02/24, 3:02 pm - +263 78 404 6865: I'll also have a promising future in India beacause there will be a wide range of choices for me.again there is a prmising future for me in India because I'll have access to scholarships and affordable education
02/02/24, 3:05 pm - Harmehak: I am glad the resources intrigued you and you found it helpful!

I equally appreciate your thoughts on how it will help you after studying in India, Tafataona.

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
02/02/24, 3:12 pm - +263 78 404 6865: 3 300USD to 7800USD per any academic year
02/02/24, 3:13 pm - Harmehak: Alright please
02/02/24, 3:13 pm - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
02/02/24, 3:14 pm - +263 78 404 6865: Ok thank you
02/02/24, 3:14 pm - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
02/02/24, 3:14 pm - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
02/02/24, 3:14 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
02/02/24, 3:17 pm - +263 78 404 6865: Ok
02/02/24, 3:17 pm - Harmehak: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $2000-3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, 

Now *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

What are you thoughts on the same please?
02/02/24, 3:22 pm - +263 78 404 6865: I think its a great opportunity for me if get to become part of that
02/02/24, 3:23 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate, Tafataona,

So, from Mr Piyush's experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,

While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time. 

This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year. 

Wouldn't you agree to the same?
02/02/24, 5:02 pm - Harmehak: Do ensure active participation.
02/02/24, 8:37 pm - Harmehak: I was expecting your response, now I would be scheduling your session for *tomorrow at 10 AM CAT*, as my working hours for the day are over and it's already been a long day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Do ensure active participation tomorrow, Tafataona.*

03/02/24, 5:50 am - +263 78 404 6865: Ok
03/02/24, 10:03 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
03/02/24, 10:03 am - Harmehak: I would like to share an exciting news that, *We will be visiting Zimbabwe this month to prepare our Edoofians for the journey ahead and we look forward to you being a part of the mega seminar for aspirants.*
03/02/24, 10:29 am - +263 78 404 6865: Yes please

03/02/24, 10:36 am - +263 78 404 6865: Edoofa is making higher education affordable and accessible for international students by providing scholarships for students internationally
03/02/24, 10:39 am - Harmehak: That's great,

03/02/24, 10:39 am - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
03/02/24, 10:39 am - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
03/02/24, 10:39 am - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

03/02/24, 11:47 am - Harmehak: Have you followed the discussion so far, Tafataona?
03/02/24, 12:33 pm - +263 78 404 6865: Yes
03/02/24, 12:34 pm - Harmehak: May I know the reason behind not ensuring active participation, Tafataona?
03/02/24, 12:35 pm - +263 78 404 6865: My network is very poor this side.im soo sorry
03/02/24, 12:37 pm - Harmehak: I understand!
03/02/24, 12:38 pm - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
03/02/24, 12:54 pm - +263 78 404 6865: The Earn While You Learn helps a student by reducing costs of education
03/02/24, 12:54 pm - +263 78 404 6865: Education costs will be reduced as the students work and get payed while learning.by so doing they will cover some of their education costs by the money they get
03/02/24, 12:59 pm - Harmehak: Yes please!
03/02/24, 1:00 pm - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

03/02/24, 1:02 pm - +263 78 404 6865: Yes
03/02/24, 1:03 pm - Harmehak: That is great, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes. 

Are you ready?
03/02/24, 1:04 pm - +263 78 404 6865: Yes
03/02/24, 1:05 pm - Harmehak: Tafataona as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
03/02/24, 1:05 pm - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
03/02/24, 1:07 pm - +263 78 404 6865: $1500 to $2250
03/02/24, 1:07 pm - +263 78 404 6865: Ok
03/02/24, 1:07 pm - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
03/02/24, 1:07 pm - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
03/02/24, 1:07 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
03/02/24, 1:08 pm - +263 78 404 6865: Ok
03/02/24, 1:09 pm - Harmehak: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
03/02/24, 1:10 pm - +263 78 404 6865: Yes
03/02/24, 1:11 pm - Harmehak: That's amazing, so now that you have understood how Edoofa makes the application process affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
03/02/24, 1:11 pm - Harmehak: Now as you can see, because of such an amazing opportunity that Edoofa provides to its students, Edoofa receives thousands of applications on a  daily basis out of which Eligibility Evaluation takes place as I did share with you above, so only if the student is found eligible for the program and get their Acceptance Letter, *they will have to pay the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Acceptance Letter after which they start with their admission process and the Earn While You Learn Program.*
03/02/24, 1:11 pm - Harmehak: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
03/02/24, 1:14 pm - +263 78 404 6865: Ok
03/02/24, 1:15 pm - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
03/02/24, 1:15 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
03/02/24, 1:15 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in their country itself.
03/02/24, 1:15 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
03/02/24, 1:17 pm - +263 78 404 6865: Yes
03/02/24, 1:18 pm - Harmehak: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
03/02/24, 1:18 pm - Harmehak: Basically, this registration fee ($500-$1000) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024-2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
03/02/24, 1:18 pm - Harmehak: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*

Here is a picture of the Visa of one of the Edoofian who arrived in India, for 2023 Academic Intake.
03/02/24, 1:18 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
03/02/24, 1:18 pm - +263 78 404 6865: Ok
03/02/24, 1:19 pm - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
03/02/24, 1:19 pm - Harmehak: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)
03/02/24, 1:19 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
03/02/24, 1:25 pm - +263 78 404 6865: Ok thank you
03/02/24, 1:26 pm - Harmehak: Do connect your parents with Mrs Ruth as well, Tafataona!
03/02/24, 1:27 pm - +263 78 404 6865: Ok thank you
03/02/24, 1:29 pm - Harmehak: So far, what all would you like to ask, Tafataona?
03/02/24, 1:30 pm - +263 78 404 6865: I think all is well for now
03/02/24, 1:31 pm - Harmehak: Alright please!
03/02/24, 1:31 pm - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
03/02/24, 1:31 pm - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
03/02/24, 1:31 pm - Harmehak: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

The Senior Counselor and Director will make decisions based on your interview and adhere strictly to the given time. Follow instructions diligently, and if the session is completed within the allotted time, your application will proceed.

Happy Family Discussion!
Stay Blessed!
03/02/24, 2:02 pm - +263 78 404 6865: Thak you
03/02/24, 2:02 pm - Harmehak: You're welcome
03/02/24, 6:21 pm - Harmehak: Excuse me for the same, 

*Monday* on 05-02-23
05/02/24, 11:51 am - Harmehak: Good Morning Everyone, Hope you are doing well.

I believe you must have discussed all the above mentioned points with your family?

I am here to address any questions if they have any.

Are we good to proceed with your application now?
05/02/24, 11:55 am - +263 78 404 6865: Yes please
05/02/24, 11:56 am - Harmehak: So how was your discussion with your parents, Tafataona?

What all did you discuss with them?
05/02/24, 11:57 am - +263 78 404 6865: They just went though the information and agreed with everything without questions
05/02/24, 11:58 am - Harmehak: Alright please!
05/02/24, 11:58 am - Harmehak: Have you already had the opportunity to connect with Mrs. Ruth? 

You see, her story is truly remarkable. As a single parent, juggling the responsibilities of a small-scale farmer and the mother of two daughters, she has persevered. Her journey with Edoofa is a testament to how dedicated individuals can overcome obstacles.
Mrs. Ruth's experience with Edoofa is a testament to the transformative impact our programs can have. She not only managed her family's needs but also seized the opportunity for her daughters to achieve higher education. The support and guidance she received from Edoofa were instrumental in her success. The process was challenging, yet incredibly rewarding. Mrs. Ruth's determination, combined with Edoofa's assistance, has paved the way for a brighter future.
05/02/24, 11:59 am - +263 78 404 6865: Not yet but my parents are putting their effort to coonect with her
05/02/24, 11:59 am - Harmehak: Alright please!

However, did you connect?
05/02/24, 12:00 pm - +263 78 404 6865: Not yet
05/02/24, 12:00 pm - +263 78 404 6865: But im doing soo
05/02/24, 12:17 pm - Harmehak: Alright please!
05/02/24, 12:17 pm - +263 78 404 6865: Ok thank you
05/02/24, 12:17 pm - Harmehak: Okay so in that case, I would like to ask you a few questions, but before that with immense pleasure, I would like to share the glimpses of the Africa Visit of our Founders which took place in June 2023! 

*It was a much-awaited event and they were welcomed by Ministries, Educationalists, Edoofians, and Parents across different African Countries. This is a must-watch video depicting the Acceptance of the Program in the African Continent, especially in Zimbabwe!!*

05/02/24, 12:18 pm - +263 78 404 6865: Ok thank you
05/02/24, 12:25 pm - Harmehak: Did you go through the shared video, Tafataona?
05/02/24, 12:30 pm - +263 78 404 6865: Its downloading i have poor network this side
05/02/24, 12:36 pm - Harmehak: I do understand!
05/02/24, 12:36 pm - +263 78 404 6865: Thank you
05/02/24, 1:01 pm - Harmehak: Okay so Tafataona, can you tell me:-

1. What is the name of the course which you would be studying through the Edoofa Program?

2. Through Edoofa in which country would you be pursuing your higher education?

3. What is the average cost for studies in that country without a scholarship?

4. What is the annual fee you will pay if found eligible for the program (yearly fee after Edoofa Scholarship)?

5. What is the enrollment fee of the Edoofa Program? 

6. If you are found eligible for the program in how many days you will have to pay the first part of your enrollment fee?

7. After receiving your offer letter from the Edoofa Academic Board, you will have to pay your registration fee in order to finalise your university admission and reserve your scholarship seat. This registration fee will be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?
05/02/24, 5:50 pm - Harmehak: Are we connected?

*Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage.*
A fact that draws our attention is that, according to his position in life, an extravagant man is either admired or loathed. A successful business man does nothing to increase his popularity by being prudent with his money. A person who is wealthy is expected to lead a luxurious life and to be lavish with his hospitality. If he is not so, he is considered mean, and his reputation in business may even suffer in consequence. The paradox remains that he had not been careful with his money in the first place; he would never have achieved his present wealth.
Among the low income group, a different set of values exists. The young clerk, who makes his wife a present of a new dress when he has not paid his house rent, is condemned as extravagant. Carefulness with money to the point of meanness is applauded as a virtue. Nothing in his life is considered more worthy than paying his bills. The ideal wife for such a man separates her housekeeping money into joyless little piles – so much for rent, for food, for the children’s shoes, she is able to face the milkman with equanimity every, month satisfied with her economizing ways , and never knows the guilt of buying something she can’t really afford .
As for myself, I fall neither of these categories. If I have money to spare I can be extravagant, but when, as is usually the case, I am hard up and then I am the meanest man imaginable.

1. Which of the following would be the most appropriate title for the passage
a)The cause of poverty is extravagance.
b)Stingy habits of the poor.

2.According to the passage the person, who is a successful businessman and wealthy
a)Is more popular if he appears to be wasting away his time.
b)Is expected to have lavish lifestyle.
c)Must be extravagant before achieving success.
d)Should not bother about popularity.

3. The phrase ‘lavish with his hospitality’ in the third sentence of the first paragraph means
a)Extravagance in entertaining guest.
b)Unconcerned in treating his friends and relatives.
c)Thoughtful in spending only on guests and strangers.
d)Stinginess in dealing with his relatives.

4.The word ‘paradox’ in the last sentence of the first paragraph means
a)A word that brings out the hidden meaning
b)Statement based on facts
c)a statement that seems self-contradictory but in reality expresses a possible truth.
d)Statement based on the popular opinion

5.What is the meaning of the word “equanimity”?

b)Discomposure

Whey to Go Greek yogurt—a strained form of cultured yogurt—has grown enormously in popularity in the United States since it was first introduced in the country in the late 1980s. From 2011 to 2012 alone, sales of Greek yogurt in the US increased by 50 percent. The resulting increase in Greek yogurt production has forced those involved in the business to address the detrimental effects that the yogurt-making process may be having on the environment.

Given these solutions as well as the many health benefits of the food, the advantages of Greek yogurt Q5. outdo the potential drawbacks of its production.Sentence [1] The main environmental problem caused by the production of Greek yogurt is the creation of acid whey as a by-product.Sentence [2] Because it requires up to four times more milk to make than conventional yogurt does, Greek yogurt produces larger amounts of acid whey, which is difficult to dispose of.Sentence [3] To address the problem of disposal, farmers have found a number of uses for acid whey. Sentence[4] They can add it to livestock feed as a protein Q.6. supplement, and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt.Sentence[5] If it is improperly introduced into the environment, acid-whey runoff Q.7. can pollute waterways, depleting the oxygen content of streams and rivers as it decomposes.
