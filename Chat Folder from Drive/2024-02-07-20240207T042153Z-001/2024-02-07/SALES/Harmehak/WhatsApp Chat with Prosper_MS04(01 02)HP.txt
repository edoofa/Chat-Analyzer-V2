03/02/24, 10:36 am - Harmehak: *Meanwhile I would like to add that now we have five students who will be traveling to India from Mt Selinda High School for their higher education through the Edoofa Program in the August 2024 intake and one student for the August 2025 intake.*

1. Belinda Dube 
2. Tadiwanashe Marwa
3. Munashe Hlahla
4. Katsaura Vimbai Audrey
5. Chimbirimbiri Lenon
6. Trevor Kaiboni
03/02/24, 10:59 am - +263 77 385 6297: How many A level points do you consider for a student to qualify for entry into the university
03/02/24, 11:19 am - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!
03/02/24, 11:59 am - +263 77 385 6297: Iam confident prosper will score high points
03/02/24, 12:20 pm - Harmehak: That's great!
03/02/24, 12:21 pm - Harmehak: Could you please share Prosper's O level results and A level subject combination?
03/02/24, 12:29 pm - +263 77 385 6297: A level subjects 

Animal science 
Biology 
Mathematics 
Geography
03/02/24, 12:30 pm - +263 77 385 6297: O level results  

I will sent when l get to where they are
03/02/24, 12:33 pm - +263 77 385 6297: But he passed all the subjects he wrote
03/02/24, 12:33 pm - Harmehak: Alright please!
03/02/24, 12:34 pm - Harmehak: Duly noted!

So what would be like to pursue for his higher education in India, Mr Moffat?
03/02/24, 12:58 pm - +263 77 385 6297: You would better advise me considering his subject combination. 

He wanted to do medicine but lam told that he was supposed to do chemestry to qualify
03/02/24, 1:01 pm - Harmehak: Yes please!

Physics, Chemistry are crucial requirements!
03/02/24, 1:02 pm - Harmehak: Now, majority of the time Zimbabwean students study subjects as per Zimbabwe's requirements, therefore, the only courses left that these students could pursue ahead which would also align with the healthcare sector are 

1. *Bachelor of Science in Nutrition and Dietetics*

2. *Bachelor of Science in Microbiology*

3. *Bachelor of Science in Medical Laboratory Technology*

4. *Bachelor of Science in Cardiovascular Technology*

Along with *Bachelor in Geography* as per his subject combination! <This message was edited>

03/02/24, 1:40 pm - Harmehak: Mr Moffat, so now as we proceed ahead with the remaining discussion, I am sure you might have a question in mind, what exactly are the reasons due to which Edoofa Recommends India as a higher education platform?
03/02/24, 1:42 pm - +263 77 385 6297: Thank you,  go ahead
03/02/24, 1:44 pm - Harmehak: Alright please, let me add to it, you see over the past 6 years, the Edoofa Scholarship Program is only focused in India, because of the following reasons:

03/02/24, 7:19 pm - Harmehak: I was expecting your response, now I would be scheduling your session for *Monday at 9:30 AM CAT*, as my working hours for the day are over and it's already been a long day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

Wishing you all a blessed weekend!
03/02/24, 9:34 pm - +263 77 385 6297: Yes l was following.
03/02/24, 9:46 pm - +263 77 430 6871: Thank you  same to you
05/02/24, 9:40 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
05/02/24, 10:33 am - +263 77 385 6297: Good Morning. Iam ready but some network challenges
05/02/24, 10:36 am - Harmehak: I do understand!
05/02/24, 10:36 am - Harmehak: Thats great!

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
05/02/24, 11:09 am - +263 77 385 6297: Iam not aware.
05/02/24, 11:13 am - Harmehak: Alright please!
05/02/24, 11:13 am - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
05/02/24, 11:32 am - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
05/02/24, 11:32 am - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
05/02/24, 11:32 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
05/02/24, 12:30 pm - +263 77 385 6297: Well thats fine .
05/02/24, 12:32 pm - +263 77 385 6297: I hope you will approve my child's scholarship .I will be happy because l cannot afford  that much on my own
05/02/24, 12:39 pm - Harmehak: In simple words Mr Moffat, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
05/02/24, 12:40 pm - Harmehak: However as per my experience, I can share with you that *if he is able to perform and clear all these criteria with a high passing grade, he would be eligible for higher quantum of Scholarship*, in which you will just have to pay a minimal fee of *$1200-$1800*, Which would cover your entire fees be it food, accommodation, Tuition etc.
05/02/24, 12:42 pm - +263 77 385 6297: We accepted. Thank you
05/02/24, 12:47 pm - Harmehak: What are your thoughts on the costs and affordability, Mr Moffat?
05/02/24, 12:52 pm - +263 77 385 6297: He can reduce his annual fees through the earn while you learn. If there is any balance, I will pay it
05/02/24, 12:57 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate please!
05/02/24, 12:58 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

Now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program in detail and how it would assist you.
05/02/24, 12:58 pm - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
05/02/24, 12:58 pm - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
05/02/24, 12:58 pm - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0


Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

05/02/24, 1:24 pm - +263 77 385 6297: It's fine
05/02/24, 1:30 pm - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $1800 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$600 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $50-$60 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
05/02/24, 1:42 pm - +263 77 385 6297: Fine ,Iam following.
05/02/24, 1:42 pm - Harmehak: So far, do you have any queries, Mr Moffat?
05/02/24, 1:43 pm - +263 77 385 6297: No I don't have.
05/02/24, 1:44 pm - Harmehak: Alright please!
05/02/24, 1:45 pm - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

05/02/24, 2:05 pm - +263 77 385 6297: Yes
05/02/24, 2:07 pm - Harmehak: Great!
05/02/24, 2:07 pm - Harmehak: Mr Moffat, Senior Academician Mr Piyush were in Zimbabwe for about 90 days, from his experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,

While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time. 

This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year. 

Wouldn't you agree to the same?
05/02/24, 2:08 pm - +263 77 385 6297: Yes , I agree
05/02/24, 2:10 pm - Harmehak: So after going through the costs of education in India, Mr Moffat, are you now in a better position to relate how Edoofa is making higher education Affordable and accessible for international students in India?

Along with an opportunity like the Earn While You Learn Program?
05/02/24, 2:15 pm - +263 77 385 6297: Yes , Edoofa is making education affordable.
05/02/24, 2:16 pm - Harmehak: That is great, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes. 

Are you ready?
05/02/24, 2:19 pm - +263 77 385 6297: Yes
05/02/24, 2:23 pm - Harmehak: MR Moffat, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
05/02/24, 2:23 pm - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
05/02/24, 2:35 pm - +263 77 385 6297: 1500=2500
05/02/24, 2:35 pm - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
05/02/24, 2:35 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
05/02/24, 2:35 pm - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
05/02/24, 2:51 pm - Harmehak: Mr Moffat, Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
05/02/24, 3:14 pm - +263 77 385 6297: Yes
05/02/24, 3:16 pm - Harmehak: That's amazing, so now that you have understood how Edoofa makes the application process affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
05/02/24, 3:16 pm - Harmehak: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

Phase 3: Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.
05/02/24, 3:16 pm - Harmehak: *However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
05/02/24, 3:31 pm - Harmehak: Did you follow the same, Mr Moffat?

You can also connect with Munashe Hlahla and her guardian as she is also a part of the program for 2025 intake as Munashe is currently in Upper 6 with Prosper.
05/02/24, 3:34 pm - +263 77 385 6297: Do you have their contact no
05/02/24, 3:35 pm - Harmehak: Sure please, Let me check with Mrs Magret first!
05/02/24, 3:35 pm - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
05/02/24, 3:35 pm - Harmehak: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)
05/02/24, 3:36 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
05/02/24, 4:01 pm - Harmehak: Did you happen to connect with Mrs Ruth, Mr Moffat?
05/02/24, 4:07 pm - +263 77 385 6297: Yes , she said that she come back to me in the evening
05/02/24, 4:07 pm - Harmehak: Alright please.
05/02/24, 4:08 pm - Harmehak: Meanwhile, I would be connecting you with Mrs Magret too once she is online.
05/02/24, 4:11 pm - Harmehak: This message was deleted
05/02/24, 4:11 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
05/02/24, 4:11 pm - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
05/02/24, 4:11 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle.
05/02/24, 4:11 pm - Harmehak: Step 5: After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities. 

August 2025 intake, applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from the Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 instalments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.
05/02/24, 4:11 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
05/02/24, 4:20 pm - +263 77 385 6297: Iam reading through.
05/02/24, 4:20 pm - Harmehak: Alright please!
05/02/24, 4:42 pm - Harmehak: Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.
05/02/24, 4:42 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
05/02/24, 4:49 pm - +263 77 385 6297: Ok ok. We can proceed to step 2 .
05/02/24, 4:49 pm - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
05/02/24, 4:49 pm - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*

You see, her story is truly remarkable. As a single parent, juggling the responsibilities of a small-scale farmer and the mother of two daughters, she has persevered. Her journey with Edoofa is a testament to how dedicated individuals can overcome obstacles.
Mrs. Ruth's experience with Edoofa is a testament to the transformative impact our programs can have. She not only managed her family's needs but also seized the opportunity for her daughters to achieve higher education. The support and guidance she received from Edoofa were instrumental in her success. The process was challenging, yet incredibly rewarding. Mrs. Ruth's determination, combined with Edoofa's assistance, has paved the way for a brighter future.

*It was a much-awaited event and they were welcomed by Ministries, Educationalists, Edoofians, and Parents across different African Countries. This is a must-watch video depicting the Acceptance of the Program in the African Continent, especially in Zimbabwe!!*
06/02/24, 6:06 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
