30/01/24, 11:51 am - +263 77 360 6663: Unfortunately I'm driving at the moment but I'll go through it.
30/01/24, 11:54 am - Harmehak: I do understand please!
30/01/24, 11:54 am - Harmehak: Meanwhile may I know if, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
30/01/24, 11:57 am - +263 77 360 6663: No one in India but I have a niece on scholarship in the states
30/01/24, 11:57 am - Harmehak: Oh alright please!
30/01/24, 11:57 am - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
30/01/24, 11:57 am - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
30/01/24, 11:57 am - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
30/01/24, 11:57 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
30/01/24, 1:14 pm - Harmehak: Did you follow the discussion so far, Mrs Ndaiziveyi?
30/01/24, 2:46 pm - Harmehak: Are we connected?

@263788651970 @263773606663
30/01/24, 2:54 pm - +263 77 360 6663: I have
30/01/24, 2:57 pm - Harmehak: In simple words Mrs Ndaiziveyi, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
30/01/24, 2:57 pm - Harmehak: However as per my experience, I can share with you that *if he is able to perform and clear all these criteria with a high passing grade, he would be eligible for higher quantum of Scholarship*, in which you will just have to pay a minimal fee of *$1200-$1800*, Which would cover your entire fees be it food, accommodation, Tuition etc.
30/01/24, 2:57 pm - Harmehak: What are your thoughts on the same?
30/01/24, 2:59 pm - +263 77 360 6663: I like the arrangement
30/01/24, 3:05 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate,

What's your take on the finances and the affordability, Mrs Ndaiziveyi?
30/01/24, 8:13 pm - Harmehak: I was expecting your response, now I would be scheduling your session for *tomorrow at 9:30 AM CAT*, as my working hours for the day are over and it's already been a long day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
31/01/24, 9:37 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
31/01/24, 9:48 am - +263 77 360 6663: It's affordable
31/01/24, 9:48 am - +263 77 360 6663: Good
31/01/24, 9:48 am - +263 77 360 6663: Morning
31/01/24, 9:50 am - Harmehak: I appreciate!
31/01/24, 9:50 am - Harmehak: Mrs Ndaiziveyi, Senior Academician Mr Piyush were in Zimbabwe for about 90 days, from his experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,

While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time. 

This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year. 

Wouldn't you agree to the same?
31/01/24, 11:40 am - +263 77 360 6663: That's true
31/01/24, 11:40 am - +263 77 360 6663: Things here are very bad
31/01/24, 11:41 am - Harmehak: Indeed!

So now are you in a better position to relate how Edoofa is making higher education affordable and accessible for international students in India, Mrs Ndaiziveyi?
31/01/24, 11:44 am - +263 77 360 6663: That's true
31/01/24, 11:44 am - Harmehak: That's great,

Now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program in detail and how it would assist you.
31/01/24, 11:44 am - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
31/01/24, 11:44 am - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
31/01/24, 11:44 am - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis

Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

02/02/24, 9:51 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
02/02/24, 9:53 am - +263 77 360 6663: Good morning
02/02/24, 9:53 am - +263 77 360 6663: Yes we can start now
02/02/24, 10:00 am - Harmehak: Mrs Ndaiziveyi, have you been able to follow the discussion so far?
02/02/24, 10:11 am - +263 77 360 6663: I have
02/02/24, 10:12 am - Harmehak: So far, would you like to ask anything?
02/02/24, 11:15 am - +263 77 360 6663: I would like to know if my son is eligible for a scholarship and if possible how much it's going to be 
2) Method of payment
02/02/24, 11:17 am - Harmehak: Did you happen to follow the costs if he happens to get a higher quantum of scholarship?
02/02/24, 11:17 am - Harmehak: Currently we are in the Counseling session.

If you manage to participate actively towards, by the end of the same you would be aware of the entire process.
02/02/24, 11:18 am - Harmehak: Any payments are made after he is found eligible.
02/02/24, 11:18 am - +263 77 360 6663: Ok thanks
02/02/24, 11:30 am - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
02/02/24, 12:01 pm - +263 77 360 6663: Ok now I understand
02/02/24, 12:30 pm - Harmehak: That's great
02/02/24, 12:30 pm - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

02/02/24, 2:23 pm - +263 77 360 6663: I do...this is the first time that I've heard about this... what kind of projects and assignments will they be doing
02/02/24, 2:37 pm - Harmehak: I happened to share the brief earlier Mrs Ndaiziveyi.

Did you follow the same?
02/02/24, 2:42 pm - +263 77 360 6663: Ok so basically what you are saying is that they are recruited by companies that they will be working for...that's how they get their credits?
02/02/24, 2:46 pm - Harmehak: Mrs Ndaiziveyi, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
02/02/24, 2:48 pm - Harmehak: Students participate in the Earn While You Learn projects under Edoofa itself, they would be alloted mentors who will assist them with the projects.
02/02/24, 2:50 pm - +263 77 360 6663: Ok I now understand
02/02/24, 2:50 pm - Harmehak: Alright please!

As of now, would you like to ask anything?
02/02/24, 2:56 pm - +263 77 360 6663: I think most of the questions that I might have have been answered
02/02/24, 2:58 pm - +263 77 360 6663: Concerning the university that he will be attending does he choose himself or there is a placement system
02/02/24, 3:01 pm - Harmehak: During the admissions process, you would receive multiple applications from the universities where his application would qualify for.

After the same you would discuss as a family and decide the university please.
02/02/24, 3:37 pm - Harmehak: Mrs Ndaiziveyi, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes. 

Are you ready?
02/02/24, 4:33 pm - Harmehak: This message was deleted
02/02/24, 5:03 pm - Harmehak: I am expecting your response, Mrs Ndaiziveyi.
