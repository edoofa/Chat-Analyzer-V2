29/01/24, 3:03 pm - Harmehak: You see, Vimbai, Senior Academician Mr. Piyush was in Zimbabwe for about 90 days. He had the privilege of meeting many Zimbabwean students who had applied for the Edoofa Program back in 2018-2019. However, at that time, they didn't proceed because they were enticed by the prospect of earning quick money in the country. This year, when they met him, they shared how difficult things have been for them. Some of them, despite holding reputed degrees from UZ, MSU, and HIT, are working as petrol attendants, while others have started careers as mobile/laptop repair technicians. Some were facing even more challenges, resorting to selling Ecocash, Simcards, or vegetables.

Observing this scenario, Mr. Piyush saw many of them regretting not seizing the opportunity when they had the chance. So, what you are sharing, I can understand that, in reality, things are much more challenging over there.
29/01/24, 3:05 pm - +263 71 838 9027: Yes , they really are , that is why I'm opting to learn abroad.
29/01/24, 3:06 pm - Harmehak: I understand and I am glad you are making efforts for a promising future, Vimbai!

29/01/24, 3:13 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate your understanding, Vimbai!

29/01/24, 3:25 pm - +263 71 838 9027: India is an innovative country , I see , this makes me more interested in studying in India, CEOs of well-known organisations are from India and also India has a currency that has Great buying power . What I liked about India is that it is an English speaking country.Communication won't be a problem
29/01/24, 3:35 pm - Harmehak: I am glad this intrigued you and you found it helpful, Vimbai!

I am delighted to have your acknowledgement too!

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
29/01/24, 3:36 pm - +263 71 838 9027: No we are not aware
29/01/24, 3:37 pm - Harmehak: Alright please!
29/01/24, 3:37 pm - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
29/01/24, 3:38 pm - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
29/01/24, 3:38 pm - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
29/01/24, 3:38 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
29/01/24, 3:43 pm - +263 71 838 9027: Ok , I guess my father is answerable to that
29/01/24, 3:43 pm - Harmehak: I understand!
29/01/24, 3:43 pm - Harmehak: In simple words Vimbai, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
29/01/24, 3:45 pm - Harmehak: However as per my experience, I can share with you that *if you are able to perform and clear all these criteria with a high passing grade, you would be eligible for higher quantum of Scholarship*, in which you will just have to pay a minimal fee of *$1200-$1800*, Which would cover your entire fees be it food, accommodation, Tuition etc.

What are your thoughts on the same?
29/01/24, 3:45 pm - +263 71 838 9027: Okay
29/01/24, 3:46 pm - +263 71 838 9027: That would be good,I wish to pass with a higher quantam

Yes for a start l know it must be huge payment which l think l can save
29/01/24, 3:48 pm - +263 77 336 0698: ... will be basing..*
29/01/24, 3:56 pm - Harmehak: While I understand the same!
29/01/24, 3:56 pm - Harmehak: Did you happen to follow the same, please? <This message was edited>
29/01/24, 3:58 pm - +263 71 838 9027: Yes
29/01/24, 4:00 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate!
29/01/24, 4:01 pm - Harmehak: Vimbai, from his experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,

While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time. 

This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year. 

Wouldn't you agree to the same?
29/01/24, 4:04 pm - +263 77 336 0698: So please consider her
29/01/24, 4:04 pm - +263 71 838 9027: Yes I agree , food is being sold for more than a dollar,in Zimbabwean universities of which it's expensive
29/01/24, 4:17 pm - Harmehak: I understand please,

I believe now you would be in a better position to relate how Edoofa is making higher education affordable and accessible for international students in India, Vimbai?
29/01/24, 4:18 pm - +263 71 838 9027: Yes , I can relate.
29/01/24, 4:22 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

Now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program in detail and how it would assist you.
29/01/24, 4:22 pm - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
29/01/24, 4:22 pm - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
29/01/24, 4:22 pm - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

29/01/24, 4:23 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
29/01/24, 4:34 pm - +263 71 838 9027: Thank you so much , I have learnt a lot about the Earn While You learn program , it is wiser to join the program because it makes the scholarship affordable
29/01/24, 4:36 pm - Harmehak: Very correct, Vimbai!
29/01/24, 4:37 pm - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $1800 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$600 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $50-$60 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
29/01/24, 4:39 pm - +263 71 838 9027: Ok , thank you very much I understand, it is so affordable
29/01/24, 4:46 pm - Harmehak: You're very welcome please!
29/01/24, 4:47 pm - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

29/01/24, 4:51 pm - +263 71 838 9027: Ok,I see , so you get awarded for the scholarship credits after the EWYL program
29/01/24, 4:52 pm - Harmehak: Yes please
29/01/24, 4:52 pm - +263 71 838 9027: Ok thank you so much
29/01/24, 4:52 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
29/01/24, 4:54 pm - +263 71 838 9027: Yes I see , you are very different indeed
29/01/24, 5:04 pm - Harmehak: That is great, 

So, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes. 

Are you ready?
29/01/24, 5:06 pm - +263 71 838 9027: Yes
29/01/24, 5:18 pm - Harmehak: Vimbai, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
29/01/24, 5:18 pm - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
29/01/24, 5:20 pm - +263 71 838 9027: $1500- $2250
29/01/24, 5:23 pm - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
29/01/24, 5:23 pm - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
29/01/24, 5:23 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
29/01/24, 5:26 pm - +263 71 838 9027: Ok, I hope that my dad is all ears.
29/01/24, 5:26 pm - Harmehak: You see, Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
29/01/24, 5:28 pm - +263 71 838 9027: Yes
29/01/24, 5:31 pm - Harmehak: That's amazing, so now that you have understood how Edoofa makes the application process affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
29/01/24, 5:31 pm - Harmehak: Now as you can see, because of such an amazing opportunity that Edoofa provides to its students, Edoofa receives thousands of applications on a  daily basis out of which Eligibility Evaluation takes place as I did share with you above, so only if the student is found eligible for the program and get their Acceptance Letter, *they will have to pay the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Acceptance Letter after which they start with their admission process and the Earn While You Learn Program.*
29/01/24, 5:31 pm - Harmehak: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
29/01/24, 5:37 pm - +263 71 838 9027: Okay, that is a good idea
29/01/24, 5:37 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate!
29/01/24, 5:38 pm - +263 71 838 9027: Ok
29/01/24, 5:38 pm - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
29/01/24, 5:38 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
29/01/24, 5:38 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in their country itself.
29/01/24, 5:38 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
29/01/24, 5:40 pm - +263 71 838 9027: Yes I did
29/01/24, 5:42 pm - Harmehak: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
29/01/24, 5:42 pm - Harmehak: Basically, this registration fee ($500-$1000) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024-2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
29/01/24, 5:42 pm - Harmehak: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*

Here is a picture of the Visa of one of the Edoofian who arrived in India, for 2023 Academic Intake.
29/01/24, 5:42 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
29/01/24, 5:46 pm - +263 71 838 9027: Ok , I see , that's a good example
29/01/24, 5:48 pm - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
29/01/24, 5:48 pm - Harmehak: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)
29/01/24, 5:48 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
29/01/24, 5:50 pm - +263 71 838 9027: Ok
29/01/24, 5:52 pm - +263 71 838 9027: Ok I have seen the video , they have had quite a good experience
29/01/24, 6:25 pm - +263 77 336 0698: Received
29/01/24, 6:30 pm - +263 77 336 0698: Very comfortable for the parent
29/01/24, 6:38 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate please!

So far, do you have any queries for me?
29/01/24, 6:41 pm - +263 77 336 0698: She must be a brave hardworking woman
29/01/24, 6:42 pm - Harmehak: Indeed, Mr Hamus;
29/01/24, 7:22 pm - +263 71 838 9027: So after the degree program, are students able to acquire jobs right there in india
29/01/24, 7:23 pm - Harmehak: Well in the final year of the course every student in the University gets multiple chances of securing a good job within India itself as all the Universities have Employment Partners which provide students with good paying job!

You see the whole purpose of the Earn While You Learn Program is to make the students of Edoofa so competent that by the time they reach the final year of their education, they should be able to get good job opportunities.
29/01/24, 7:24 pm - +263 71 838 9027: Oh okay I understand
29/01/24, 7:29 pm - Harmehak: Alright please,

Do you have any other queries for me?
29/01/24, 7:30 pm - +263 71 838 9027: Am I still in stage 1.
29/01/24, 7:32 pm - Harmehak: We have concluded with stage 1 today,

I will brief you about stage 2 if you donot have any more questions.
29/01/24, 7:33 pm - +263 71 838 9027: I don't have anymore questions.
29/01/24, 7:33 pm - +263 71 838 9027: Thank you for being patient with me
29/01/24, 7:36 pm - Harmehak: You're very welcome please
29/01/24, 7:36 pm - +263 71 838 9027: Ok
29/01/24, 7:37 pm - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
29/01/24, 7:37 pm - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
29/01/24, 7:37 pm - Harmehak: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

30/01/24, 11:55 am - Harmehak: Alright please!
30/01/24, 11:55 am - Harmehak: Have you already had the opportunity to connect with Mrs. Ruth? 

You see, her story is truly remarkable. As a single parent, juggling the responsibilities of a small-scale farmer and the mother of two daughters, she has persevered. Her journey with Edoofa is a testament to how dedicated individuals can overcome obstacles.
Mrs. Ruth's experience with Edoofa is a testament to the transformative impact our programs can have. She not only managed her family's needs but also seized the opportunity for her daughters to achieve higher education. The support and guidance she received from Edoofa were instrumental in her success. The process was challenging, yet incredibly rewarding. Mrs. Ruth's determination, combined with Edoofa's assistance, has paved the way for a brighter future.
30/01/24, 11:58 am - +263 71 838 9027: Has , I've got in touch with her and she is a very hard working woman considering that she's a single parent. She also highlighted facts about her journey with Edoofah and she said it's a wonderful experience. I was glad to get in contact with her because l also learnt a lot from her .

*Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage.*
A fact that draws our attention is that, according to his position in life, an extravagant man is either admired or loathed. A successful business man does nothing to increase his popularity by being prudent with his money. A person who is wealthy is expected to lead a luxurious life and to be lavish with his hospitality. If he is not so, he is considered mean, and his reputation in business may even suffer in consequence. The paradox remains that he had not been careful with his money in the first place; he would never have achieved his present wealth.
Among the low income group, a different set of values exists. The young clerk, who makes his wife a present of a new dress when he has not paid his house rent, is condemned as extravagant. Carefulness with money to the point of meanness is applauded as a virtue. Nothing in his life is considered more worthy than paying his bills. The ideal wife for such a man separates her housekeeping money into joyless little piles – so much for rent, for food, for the children’s shoes, she is able to face the milkman with equanimity every, month satisfied with her economizing ways , and never knows the guilt of buying something she can’t really afford .
As for myself, I fall neither of these categories. If I have money to spare I can be extravagant, but when, as is usually the case, I am hard up and then I am the meanest man imaginable.

1. Which of the following would be the most appropriate title for the passage
a)The cause of poverty is extravagance.
b)Stingy habits of the poor.
c)Being extravagant is always condemnable.
d)Extravagance is a part of the rich as well as of the poor.

2.According to the passage the person, who is a successful businessman and wealthy
a)Is more popular if he appears to be wasting away his time.
b)Is expected to have lavish lifestyle.
c)Must be extravagant before achieving success.
d)Should not bother about popularity.

3. The phrase ‘lavish with his hospitality’ in the third sentence of the first paragraph means
a)Extravagance in entertaining guest.
b)Unconcerned in treating his friends and relatives.
c)Thoughtful in spending only on guests and strangers.
d)Stinginess in dealing with his relatives.

4.The word ‘paradox’ in the last sentence of the first paragraph means
a)A word that brings out the hidden meaning
b)Statement based on facts
c)a statement that seems self-contradictory but in reality expresses a possible truth.
d)Statement based on the popular opinion

5.What is the meaning of the word “equanimity”?
a)Calmness
b)Discomposure
c)Equivocal
d)Dubious

Whey to Go Greek yogurt—a strained form of cultured yogurt—has grown enormously in popularity in the United States since it was first introduced in the country in the late 1980s. From 2011 to 2012 alone, sales of Greek yogurt in the US increased by 50 percent. The resulting increase in Greek yogurt production has forced those involved in the business to address the detrimental effects that the yogurt-making process may be having on the environment. Fortunately, farmers and others in the Greek yogurt business have found many methods of controlling and eliminating most environmental threats. Given these solutions as well as the many health benefits of the food, the advantages of Greek yogurt Q5. outdo the potential drawbacks of its production.Sentence [1] The main environmental problem caused by the production of Greek yogurt is the creation of acid whey as a by-product.Sentence [2] Because it requires up to four times more milk to make than conventional yogurt does, Greek yogurt produces larger amounts of acid whey, which is difficult to dispose of.Sentence [3] To address the problem of disposal, farmers have found a number of uses for acid whey. Sentence[4] They can add it to livestock feed as a protein Q.6. supplement, and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt.Sentence[5] If it is improperly introduced into the environment, acid-whey runoff Q.7. can pollute waterways, depleting the oxygen content of streams and rivers as it decomposes. Sentence [6] Yogurt manufacturers, food Q.8. scientists; and government officials are also working together to develop additional solutions for reusing whey.

6.supplement, and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt.
A) NO CHANGE
B) supplement and convert it into gas to use as fuel in electricity production.

Section 5

African farms have poor diets because of a number of reasons  .The reasons include poor management of farms ,political instability, economic inequality and climatic change.

Therefore , To a lesser extent , many Africans have poor diets  because their farms are stagnant and inefficient.One of the reasons why Africans have poor diets is poor management of farms . In Africa, some regions have rich and fertile soil but they are being poorly managed . Inorder to promote good soil management farmers should practice farming methods like crop rotation, shifting cultivation and mulching.Farms should be distributed to farmers who a willing to work thoroughly o n the farm and they should produce a bumber harvest .

Political instability is also another cause of poor diet and malnutrition in Africa , examples of countries like Somalia are suffering because of political instability,they usually experience wars in their country and the government is not willing to address issues of poverty that causes poor diets in those countries.African governments should elect leaders who are ready to save their  fellow people from hunger and poor living conditions. Every one must get employed inorder to enjoy higher living standards

Economic inequality is also another cause of poor diet in Africa . The government must offer food stuffs to the needy like the orphans , widows and the widowers . The Non Governmental organizations must take part in helping the above mentioned people  hence economic equality is achieved . The wealthy people should also help the poor people. 

In addition, climatic change is also a cause of poor diet in Africa.The heavens sometimes give low amount of rainfall .for example here in Zimbabwe, in the Midlands .there has hardly been a down pour .and the sun is burning as hell . To solve the issue of low rainfall , the farmers should use machinery like the irrigation systems .This will be necessary because water for the weeds will be available to water the farm.

Conclusively, there are many causes of poor diet in Africa . They may lead to diseases like kwashiorkor in Children and malnutrition in elderly people.
 
Therefore , the government should recommend, farming schemes , like "pfumvudza" that has been introduced in Zimbabwe, crop rotation, shifting cultivation and mulching.

My inspirational story 

Life is like a teacher , the more you learn, Sometimes our expectations are not our achievements . Five years back I had seen my self a  successful person by this time but life turned out to be something else .

After passing my ordinary level with flying colors I expected to secure a place for my Advanced level but I failed to get the place for no apparent reason.  The devil had locked the doors of my future all knowing that I was a brilliant student with a bright future ahead of me .

I stayed home at home but I did not lose hope . I decided to right more of my ordinary level subjects though I heard passed already .I wrote 3 more subjects and I passed them .After that the coming year by God's grace I manage to secure a place at a nearby school in my area. I went for my Advanced level but when I was about to right my exams I started to experience sickness which no one understood My parents took me to different hospitals but to no avail. I attempted to right my A levels for Three times but I failed due to sickness  .

One day I got prayed for by a certain woman of God and the illness stopped I wrote my exams and I passed with the required passes . I thank God for that because the phase of agony and pain had passed . For the bible says no weapon formed against me shall prosper. 
  
I would like to share this story with someone who has lost hope that . Keep on thriving God is the answer to all our problems and there is no permanent situation.That is my story .

30/01/24, 7:27 pm - +263 77 416 0993: <Media omitted>
30/01/24, 7:30 pm - Harmehak: Well received please, you see as per my experience over the last couple of years, I have been fortunate to have assisted over hundreds of students in achieving their career aspiration through the Edoofa Program. 

One of my key observations during helping out these students was regarding what was the common trait amongst students who are today having the best of their time in India through the Edoofa Program, and honestly I was able to come down to only one aspect that is FAMILY SUPPORT.
30/01/24, 7:30 pm - Harmehak: You see in this journey of any child's higher education, there are three major contributors 

1. Student himself/herself
2. FAMILY
3. EDOOFA PROGAM

Now all the students who are today successfully a part of the Edoofa Program, had all these three contributors working together towards the common goal which is student's success and ensuring that by the time student completes his/her higher education they should be able to get good paying jobs. 

Even if any one of the contributor does not perform to the best of their abilities, Student's overall success is hampered. Let me give you a few examples

*In the event if student wishes to work hard, Edoofa is willing to support but the Family is not willing to support, the student will not be successful under the program*

*In the event if student wishes to work hard, Family is willing to support, but Edoofa's academic Board doesn't find the student worthy, the student will not be successful under the program*

*In the event if Family is willing to support, Edoofa's Academic Board is willing to support but the student doesn't wishes to work hard, then also the student will not be successful under the program*
30/01/24, 7:30 pm - Harmehak: During the evaluation of your child's application so far, the Academic Board has evaluated a few aspects, such as student's willingness to work hard, and family's willingness to support the student so that the student can achieve what he/she has aspired. However now in your interview ahead, the Academic Board would be strictly be evaluating the Family's support towards the child higher education. 

*As you know in the event if your child is found eligible, you would have to complete a certain part of the formalities within the 7 day timeline, so may I know regarding the same, are you willing to support your child to the fullest?*
30/01/24, 7:32 pm - +263 77 416 0993: Yes I am willing to support her very much
30/01/24, 7:34 pm - Harmehak: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
30/01/24, 7:34 pm - Harmehak: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
30/01/24, 7:34 pm - Harmehak: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.
30/01/24, 7:34 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
30/01/24, 7:34 pm - Harmehak: Ideally as you know, the tentative dates:

1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 5th or 6th February 2024 for $200 and the 5th or 6th of March for the remaining $150.

2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 5th or 6th February 2024. 

Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?
30/01/24, 7:39 pm - +263 77 416 0993: I opt for the first one because it is being paid in installments..which becomes easy to pay ....
30/01/24, 7:40 pm - Harmehak: I do understand please!

Kindly acknowledge the same using a voice and if you are financially prepared for Option 1
30/01/24, 7:44 pm - +263 77 416 0993: <Media omitted>

03/02/24, 6:41 pm - Harmehak: You're very welcome Vimbai!

We look forward to you becoming a part of the program.
03/02/24, 6:42 pm - +263 71 838 9027: Welcome, daddy , greatest thanks for your support.
03/02/24, 6:44 pm - +263 71 838 9027: Ok madam ,
04/02/24, 1:28 pm - +263 71 838 9027: Good After, how do we process the payments
04/02/24, 1:30 pm - +263 71 838 9027: Which account do we use , the first one or the second one
04/02/24, 2:18 pm - Harmehak: Good Afternoon please.
04/02/24, 2:18 pm - Harmehak: Vimbai, since you must have seen, there are two modes of fee payments mentioned:-

1. Direct Bank Transfer to our Parent Company's account
2. Deposit in our associate's account over there in Zimbabwe

Which mode according to you would be convenient, so that I can brief you in-depth about that particular mode?
04/02/24, 2:51 pm - +263 77 336 0698: I would opt for 2 , since the associate , Mr C Jerera is easily accessible here Zimbabwe in case there are some inconveniences
04/02/24, 3:03 pm - Harmehak: I do understand please.
04/02/24, 3:04 pm - Harmehak: Okay so basically you see in the first mode, the Direct Bank Transfer Mode, the transfer charges which are to be borne by the parents of the student ranges between $100 to $120 which become quite high for a lot of parents considering the economic situation in Zimbabwe itself. So as not every student is in a position to cater for an additional $100 to $120 just as transfer charge, the second mode was introduced, wherein, it is the Bank deposit in Mr. Charles's Account, in this the transfer charges get divided amongst 10 students resulting in an equivalent bearing of 12.5% at the end.

So as you can see in the letter that there is a Bank deposit in, Mr. Charles Jerera (Retired Education Officer)'s account as he is our Associated Partner there in Zimbabwe, Since 2020 there have been over 1400+ students who have been assisted by Mr Charles inorder to complete their enrollment formalities as well as university fee payments after arriving in India.
04/02/24, 3:04 pm - Harmehak: Therefore the fee can also be paid through him. Since his account is a NOSTRO Account which only holds USD itself, therefore the necessary amount including the transfer charges in this mode itself would be $394 ($350 + $44 transfer charges), and the same details are as below:-

BANK NAME: FBC

SWIFT CODE: FBCPZWHA

ACC NAME: CHARLES JERERA

ACC NUMBER: 5333 0380 1404 8828

CONTACT NUMBER: +263 77 376 9854
04/02/24, 3:04 pm - Harmehak: 2 contacts.vcf (file attached)
04/02/24, 3:04 pm - Harmehak: Here is a picture, from Left Mr Angad, Sir Charles, Mr.Piiyush and Principal of Zaka High School Mr Museba.
04/02/24, 3:04 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
04/02/24, 3:04 pm - Harmehak: *For your utmost clarity, here I attach Mr. Charles's Passport*
04/02/24, 3:04 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>

04/02/24, 6:26 pm - +263 71 838 9027: Ok thank you madam , 

Another question is that,is a passport needed for the travel or  the visa will only be necessary.
04/02/24, 6:59 pm - Harmehak: Passport is a mandatory requirement for international travel please.
04/02/24, 7:14 pm - +263 71 838 9027: Okay
04/02/24, 7:26 pm - +263 71 838 9027: And also after paying the $ 350, I will start the Earn while you learn program lessons online or after I get there
04/02/24, 8:07 pm - Harmehak: The EWYL program starts after the intial payment of $200 or $350 itself, while you are still in Zimbabwe!
04/02/24, 9:21 pm - +263 71 838 9027: Ok , thank you madam
05/02/24, 8:20 am - Harmehak: You're welcome
