What did you learn about the Edoofa Program after interacting with a student beneficiary of the Edoofa Scholarship?
I learnt that EDOOFA has made International education more affordable, accessable especially for students who are not able to afford International education.Also EDOOFA helps students to apply their minds in different fields and employability is enhanced by EDOOFA 
Why should you be accepted into the Edoofa Program (20-40 Words)
I feel like I have great potential to be 1 of the successful people in life and money is the hindering factor to achieve this dream.HOWEVER, EDOOFA has made it possible for students like us to pursue our dreams
