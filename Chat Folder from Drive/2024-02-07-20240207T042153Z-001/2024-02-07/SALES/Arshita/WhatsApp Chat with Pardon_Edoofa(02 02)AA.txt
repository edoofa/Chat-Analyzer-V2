03/02/24, 10:47 am - +263 78 704 3390: We can continue
03/02/24, 11:15 am - Arshita: Pardon, it's good to see that you've invested time in understanding the program and submitting your application. Could you please share:
1)  What inspired you to apply for the Edoofa Scholarship program?
2) What are your insights and understandings of the program?
04/02/24, 4:52 pm - +263 78 704 3390: Ok thanks you
I have always been somewhat of an intellectual and nothing feels me more than excelling in my academic journey. As someone with big dreams, hope and ambition, i wish to receive the best opportunities in the most conjusive environments but this can be difficult for me due to my social standing and financial issues. Having an opportunity with Edoofa is a risk worth taking if it means i get to be who i want for me, my family and my community.
Edoofa is a great program offering great opportunities to people who struggle with their academic journey. Though being a profit making scheme, it offers chances to receive world-class education in India and beyond. So it would be an honor to be part of this platform.
04/02/24, 6:34 pm - Arshita: Let us connect at *9:30 AM CAT (05/02/2024) Monday*
to resume your session (In case you have any challenges, please let me know the time you will be available, and we will schedule accordingly)

*Please note that your participation and activeness an important parameter of evaluation.*

Stay Blessed!

06/02/24, 4:27 pm - Arshita: As your evaluation progress, I would like to appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country. In this process did you make any prior research on foreign education or applied to any University abroad?
06/02/24, 4:40 pm - +263 78 704 3390: I have researched on foreign education yes but have not applied to any.
06/02/24, 4:43 pm - Arshita: I understand ! 
Foreign education is just one challenge in this challenging world. I hope you agree that the major problem that the youth is facing is employability.
We want you to understand the difference between a Scholarship Program that has an end goal of making you individually employment-ready, and agents luring you for University Admissions abroad.
Let me share an article that is part of an awareness initiative for students interested in Studying Abroad.
