05/02/24, 9:41 am - +27 82 290 6931: 1) The Edoofa Scholarship Program opens the leeway for students to access education of high quality at a reasonable amount, which is exactly what I have been searching for 

2) This program is life changing because not only does it offer students education of high standard and quality but it also caters for their pockets as it is affordable
05/02/24, 9:41 am - Arshita: I am glad to see your understanding of the Edoofa program and appreciate your aspirations, let me guide you further to gain more knowledge on this opportunity.
*The Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees.

05/02/24, 9:43 am - +27 82 290 6931: Yes, definitely, I am!

05/02/24, 9:57 am - Arshita: Good to know more about you. You expressed yourself genuinely. 

Do you have any past experience of learning in the field of medicine?
05/02/24, 9:59 am - +27 82 290 6931: No, I have no experience but I have been in a hospital environment during career guidance at school
05/02/24, 10:01 am - Arshita: Noted
05/02/24, 10:01 am - Arshita: Moving forward, please send your O level and term results with me, preferably in picture format for your academic evaluation.

05/02/24, 10:03 am - Arshita: Noted
05/02/24, 10:04 am - Arshita: As your evaluation progress, I would like to appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country. In this process did you make any prior research on foreign education or applied to any University abroad?
05/02/24, 10:16 am - +27 82 290 6931: I feel like the education system from where I come from limits students in a way, the application processes as a local student to be specific because they judge a student based on their results only. That is what drove me to search for opportunities to study abroad and I discovered the education systems and how better they are compared to South Africa. 
I made research on foreign higher education and that’s when I met Natalie who highlighted to me about the Edoofa Program and her experience so far and I was thrilled
05/02/24, 10:18 am - Arshita: I understand ! 
Foreign education is just one challenge in this challenging world. I hope you agree that the major problem that the youth is facing is employability.
We want you to understand the difference between a Scholarship Program that has an end goal of making you individually employment-ready, and agents luring you for University Admissions abroad.
Let me share an article that is part of an awareness initiative for students interested in Studying Abroad.
05/02/24, 10:18 am - Arshita: <Media omitted>
05/02/24, 10:18 am - Arshita: Let me know once you are done
05/02/24, 10:21 am - +27 82 290 6931: I am done… I understand now
05/02/24, 10:27 am - Arshita: *Medical courses that can be offered*

*Physiotherapy*
 
*Bachelor of science in Optometry*

*Bachelor of science in Cardiovascular technology*

*Bachelor of science in Medical Lab Technology*

May I know which one shall I explain?
05/02/24, 10:29 am - +27 82 290 6931: Bachelor of Science in Optometry
05/02/24, 10:32 am - Arshita: *Bsc in Optometry is a 4 year course*

Bachelor of Optometry is an undergraduate program concerning eye care. Optometry is the science of eye care including eye examination, diagnosis, treatment and management of diseases and disorders of the visual system. It is a vision care science. Bachelor of Optometry is a four-year course containing three years of learning and a year of internship in clinical experience.

It can also be defined as the science of eye equipment (including lenses and spectacles) aimed at improving the vision of the human eye. This involves removal of all kinds of obstacles of sight which an individual may suffer from. This is a dynamic and challenging career, which allows one to nurse people, achieve personal growth, community respect, job flexibility and financial stability.

The core training and practical exposure offered in the course is designed to prepare eligible candidates for providing competent services in capacities such as Optician, Optometrist, Refractionist and Ophthalmic Assistant. A graduate of this stream can serve the community in urban, semi-urban and rural settings in private, semi-governmental and governmental sectors.

Optics is the branch of science involving the structure, function, and operation of the human eye. Optometrists are health professionals who have specialized in eye care. They deal with eye testing and provide solutions to patients suffering from vision disorders such as partial sight, hereditary vision defects, squint, weakening of eye muscles etc. They suggest alternate vision aids such as spectacles or contact lenses.

They also provide preoperative and postoperative care to individual suffering from cataract. Often optometrists discover eye conditions caused by systemic problems, such as diabetes or high blood pressure, and refer their patients to other medical doctors.
Since the eye is one of the most important human organs, optometrists are offered a wide range of lucrative career options both in India and abroad, assigned the responsibility of leading others from darkness to light, literally.
05/02/24, 10:35 am - +27 82 290 6931: Very interesting!
05/02/24, 10:38 am - Arshita: If you have understood the course well, can you tell me how you see yourself in 5 years after your course If you are provided with this career option and how can being an Edoofian enable you to achieve your career goals?
05/02/24, 10:51 am - +27 82 290 6931: In the next 5 years I see myself as an influential Optometrist, making a huge difference in the economy of India and South Africa through my resilient hard work.
Being an Edoofian will open the gateway for the initiation of my career to achieve my goals. Not only will this opportunity to help me but I will also be able to assist other students like me in the future. Being an Edoofian will open the opportunity for me to make connections in my industry and grow successfully while raising the Edoofian flag
05/02/24, 10:51 am - Arshita: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career. I believe you will be researching about the course in detail.

*Now, as you know, Edoofa Recommends India as a Higher Education Platform.*

05/02/24, 11:01 am - +27 82 290 6931: I’ve read and understood
05/02/24, 11:04 am - Arshita: I am sure after seeing all these amazing facts, you will be intrigued to study in India. So can you now tell me, How would studying in India have a positive impact on your career and help you achieve your goals?
05/02/24, 11:15 am - +27 82 290 6931: Studying in India will definitely be an amazing head start for me in terms of employment opportunities as it has a very solid and quality education system and has given birth to many influential people such as Savitri Jindal as mentioned in the visual images you’ve sent. The opportunity of studying in India will allow me to grow in my career and make connections with great people who help me achieve my goals.
05/02/24, 11:21 am - Arshita: That is amazing, As I can see, you have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead.

*By any chance are you familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship?*
05/02/24, 11:22 am - +27 82 290 6931: No, I am not familiar with it
05/02/24, 11:22 am - Arshita: Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India compared to other global hubs.

In India, international students face an average expense of *$6000-$8000 annually.* While this is very low as compared to the Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc where the cost of education ranges from $15000-$35000 annually, it is still beyond the reach of many.

With the Edoofa Scholarship Program, the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000 per annum* for the students who are found eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility Check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Laundry, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
05/02/24, 11:23 am - Arshita: <Media omitted>
05/02/24, 11:25 am - +27 82 290 6931: Yes, it is very affordable
05/02/24, 11:26 am - Arshita: Noted, 
So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians. Looking at this cost of education as well, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits which can help in reducing their fees further.

Do you know how that is done?
05/02/24, 11:27 am - +27 82 290 6931: No, I don’t
05/02/24, 11:27 am - Arshita: Let me tell you how Edoofa helps Edoofians bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the *Earn While You Learn Program*

The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that are equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable. The Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies and needs, converting an Individual into a market-ready professional. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
05/02/24, 11:28 am - Arshita: *Projects with Brands and Companies: -*
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, such as:
*Africa Global Radio-* The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project and hear from the CEO about the exposures of the Edoofa program.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4DAP24ZuY4&authuser=0
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0
*Skooqs-* This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

*Recruitment Partners:-*
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

*Webinars:-*
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars regularly with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
-Digitalization of Industries: How to Become an all-rounder in the Ever-changing Professional World by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.

05/02/24, 11:28 am - Arshita: <Media omitted>
05/02/24, 11:34 am - +27 82 290 6931: Yes definitely. It is a great way of empowering students with gaining practical experience while persuing education, this is amazing!
05/02/24, 11:37 am - Arshita: <Media omitted>
05/02/24, 11:41 am - +27 82 290 6931: I do. It is very helpful
05/02/24, 11:41 am - Arshita: Great, Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, a few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :

*1. Expert Career Counselling:* We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counsellors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.

*2. Affordability through guaranteed scholarships:* Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off.

*3. Earn While You Learn:* The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing our students for the real world. 

*4.Higher Education Concierge:* A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.*

After going through these facts that make Edoofa different, which one out of the 4 did you feel is the most significant?
05/02/24, 11:50 am - +27 82 290 6931: I feel the Expert Career Counselling is significant because every student needs guidance when perusing a career and it is the fundamentals as one is about to step into higher education.
05/02/24, 11:50 am - Arshita: Great! 
So now I know you focus more on quality education and guidance.
Let me also show you some monthly earnings of students through Earn While you Learn.

05/02/24, 11:52 am - +27 82 290 6931: Wow!
05/02/24, 11:53 am - Arshita: As you see, there is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it depends upon his/her hard work. However, who will be helping you with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
05/02/24, 11:55 am - +27 82 290 6931: My mother and father will help finance the rest of the fee
05/02/24, 11:55 am - Arshita: I believe you'll be discussing everything with your family after we complete today's session. Also, after our counselling session, I would connect to some of our beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know their experiences and proceedings well.

May I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
05/02/24, 11:58 am - +27 82 290 6931: They feel that it is a great opportunity alongside with the help of Edoofa that will reduce the burden of expensive university fees. They are very much humbled.
05/02/24, 11:59 am - Arshita: I am glad to hear that, as studying Internationally would make your career advance at an even greater pace, as you will be transformed into a professional with a well-paying job, which would help you in uplifting your family there by yourself, and provide a peaceful and hassle-free life to your parents.
05/02/24, 11:59 am - Arshita: *As we move to the last part of the session, let me highlight a few requirements while a student applies alone* 

*1) Application Form* -An online or offline form that asks for your personal details and academic background.

*2) Statement of Purpose-* An essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and your aspirations for your career.

*3) Letter of Recommendation-* from Senior authorities, School Heads or others on why they recommend you to be a right fit for an international university.
Do you know about other requirements?
05/02/24, 12:00 pm - +27 82 290 6931: No, please tell me about them
05/02/24, 12:01 pm - Arshita: Absolutely, When a student applies alone for an international University, on average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose costs between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally and act as a major parameter to decide the child’s eligibility. If you apply to 5 Universities, the average costs for the mentioned would be $1350-$1750, *without even receiving a guarantee to be selected*

*Edoofa has identified a solution for this uncertainty and unaffordability.* If a student qualifies after the eligibility check, not only does Edoofa help them draft their statement of purpose but also helps in terms of Visa Documentation Assistance, University Session and selection, Individual mentorship, etc, reducing the costs significantly to $750 which is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.

05/02/24, 12:06 pm - +27 82 290 6931: Clearly explained, I understand
