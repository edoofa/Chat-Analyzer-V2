31/01/24, 10:30 am - Arshita: I am sure after seeing all these amazing facts, you will be intrigued to study in India. So can you now tell me, How would studying in India have a positive impact on your career and help you achieve your goals?
31/01/24, 10:35 am - +263 78 829 7321: As a country with renowned institutions known for academic excellence and as a globally recognized country learning in India would have a positive impact on my career as a lawyer and help me to achieve my goal as renowned lawyer not only at local but at at global level too
31/01/24, 10:36 am - Arshita: That is amazing, As I can see, you have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead.

*By any chance are you familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship?*
31/01/24, 10:37 am - +263 78 829 7321: No I'm not
31/01/24, 10:37 am - Arshita: Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India compared to other global hubs.

In India, international students face an average expense of *$6000-$8000 annually.* While this is very low as compared to the Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc where the cost of education ranges from $15000-$35000 annually, it is still beyond the reach of many.

With the Edoofa Scholarship Program, the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000 per annum* for the students who are found eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility Check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Laundry, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
31/01/24, 10:37 am - Arshita: <Media omitted>
31/01/24, 10:37 am - Arshita: In simple words what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost $3000 or less a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well. 

However, as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even after this we allow the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.

*So do you feel the reduced cost of education is affordable to your family?*
31/01/24, 10:39 am - +263 78 829 7321: Does this mean I cannot acquire a full scholarship?
31/01/24, 10:40 am - +263 78 829 7321: It's is a bit expensive
31/01/24, 10:40 am - +263 78 829 7321: My family cannot afford
31/01/24, 10:42 am - Arshita: Edoofa is a *merit based* scholarship providing *50-100%* scholarship. 

The quantum of scholarship depends on *Academic performance, co - curricular activities along with participation in these sessions*
31/01/24, 10:43 am - +263 78 829 7321: Noted
31/01/24, 10:44 am - Arshita: Noted, 
So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians. Looking at this cost of education as well, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits which can help in reducing their fees further.

Do you know how that is done?
31/01/24, 10:45 am - +263 78 829 7321: Please explain further
31/01/24, 10:46 am - Arshita: Let me tell you how Edoofa helps Edoofians bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the *Earn While You Learn Program*

The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that are equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable. The Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies and needs, converting an Individual into a market-ready professional. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
31/01/24, 10:46 am - Arshita: *Projects with Brands and Companies: -*
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, such as:
*Africa Global Radio-* The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project and hear from the CEO about the exposures of the Edoofa program.

*Skooqs-* This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

*Recruitment Partners:-*
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

*Webinars:-*
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars regularly with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -

31/01/24, 10:51 am - Arshita: Great, Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, a few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :

*1. Expert Career Counselling:* We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counsellors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.

*2. Affordability through guaranteed scholarships:* Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off.

*3. Earn While You Learn:* The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing our students for the real world. 

*4.Higher Education Concierge:* A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.*

After going through these facts that make Edoofa different, which one out of the 4 did you feel is the most significant?
31/01/24, 10:53 am - +263 78 829 7321: Understood
31/01/24, 10:55 am - Arshita: Please answer this

31/01/24, 11:01 am - +263 78 829 7321: Okay
31/01/24, 11:01 am - Arshita: As you see, there is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it depends upon his/her hard work. However, who will be helping you with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
31/01/24, 11:04 am - +263 78 829 7321: My family
31/01/24, 11:04 am - Arshita: I believe you'll be discussing everything with your family after we complete today's session. Also, after our counselling session, I would connect to some of our beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know their experiences and proceedings well.

May I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
31/01/24, 11:04 am - +263 78 829 7321: Okay
31/01/24, 11:05 am - +263 78 829 7321: My family is okay with me studying abroad
31/01/24, 11:05 am - +263 78 829 7321: They actually think it's a great opportunity
31/01/24, 11:05 am - Arshita: I am glad to hear that, as studying Internationally would make your career advance at an even greater pace, as you will be transformed into a professional with a well-paying job, which would help you in uplifting your family there by yourself, and provide a peaceful and hassle-free life to your parents.
31/01/24, 11:05 am - Arshita: *As we move to the last part of the session, let me highlight a few requirements while a student applies alone* 

*1) Application Form* -An online or offline form that asks for your personal details and academic background.

*2) Statement of Purpose-* An essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and your aspirations for your career.

*3) Letter of Recommendation-* from Senior authorities, School Heads or others on why they recommend you to be a right fit for an international university.
Do you know about other requirements?
31/01/24, 11:07 am - +263 78 829 7321: Okay when is this needed?
31/01/24, 11:08 am - +263 78 829 7321: 🙏🏽
31/01/24, 11:09 am - Arshita: Absolutely, When a student applies alone for an international University, on average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose costs between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally and act as a major parameter to decide the child’s eligibility. If you apply to 5 Universities, the average costs for the mentioned would be $1350-$1750, *without even receiving a guarantee to be selected*

*Edoofa has identified a solution for this uncertainty and unaffordability.* If a student qualifies after the eligibility check, not only does Edoofa help them draft their statement of purpose but also helps in terms of Visa Documentation Assistance, University Session and selection, Individual mentorship, etc, reducing the costs significantly to $750 which is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
31/01/24, 11:09 am - Arshita: <Media omitted>
31/01/24, 11:10 am - +263 78 829 7321: I do not know of any other requirements
31/01/24, 11:11 am - Arshita: The enrollment fee is to be paid only if a child is found eligible for the Edoofa Scholarship Program after passing the eligibility check stage, it includes, 

*Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
*Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
*Earn While You Learn Program and training*
*University sessions and selection*
*A guaranteed scholarship seat*
*Visa Documentation Assistance*
*The Foster and Care throughout the course of an Edoofian*
31/01/24, 11:11 am - Arshita: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge due to which parents might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short period of 7 days and for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option wherein if the student is found eligible, instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, *parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days thereby reducing the financial pressure.*
31/01/24, 11:13 am - +263 78 829 7321: Noted
31/01/24, 11:16 am - Arshita: There are 3 phases to the enrollment process.
 
*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation
If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Acceptance Letter. You are supposed to pay the enrollment fee of $350 in 7 days for the scholarship seat reservation and to begin the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2*: Once the students complete Phase 1 they will be starting the Earn While You Learn program session(Each student will have an opportunity to earn scholarship credits that can be used to reduce their fee even before their A-Level result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final A-level results are out and the student has passed the requirement as per Edoofa, then their final university evaluation and Admission will continue. However, if the student wouldn’t meet the requirements as per the university and Edoofa, then the $350 will be refunded to the parent.

The amount of credits earned by the student in phase 2 can be used for the first year’s annual fee itself so that parents are relieved from financial stress paving the way for proper financial planning for higher education.

31/01/24, 11:19 am - +263 78 829 7321: Stage 2
31/01/24, 11:19 am - Arshita: Well, Nothando,
We also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.

*Step 1:Connect with a counsellor-* As your counsellor, now we are going through the counselling process discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Edoofa Scholarship.                        

*Step 2:Eligibility Check-* The eligibility check includes the interviews with the Academic Board and Scholarship Test.

*Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa-* If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter.

*Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program-* This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.

We are left with steps 5 and 6.
So shall I explain them to you?
31/01/24, 11:21 am - +263 78 829 7321: Okay
31/01/24, 11:22 am - Arshita: *Step 5* After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by making a payment of the registration fee within a few weeks.
31/01/24, 11:22 am - Arshita: This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself and after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).
31/01/24, 11:22 am - Arshita: *Step 6:* Once you are done with the registration fee payment, you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.
31/01/24, 11:22 am - Arshita: I hope you are clear with the process.
31/01/24, 11:23 am - +263 78 829 7321: Yes I am
31/01/24, 3:59 pm - Arshita: We have come to the end of your counselling session. Before I guide you Step 2 of the Eligibility Check, I want you to have a full-fledged discussion of the Edoofa program within your family as higher education is supposed to be a family decision. Ensure to include these aspects during the discussions:-

*About the EDOOFA Program and its vision of making Education Affordable and Edoofians Employment Ready.*
*Value of the career of an Edoofian after pursuing higher education in India.*
*The financial aspects and how Edoofa brings in affordability and self-financing opportunities for students.*
31/01/24, 3:59 pm - Arshita: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences,

*Edoofa’s Website- www.edoofa.com* 
*Pictures (Edoofians from Africa studying in India): https://tinyurl.com/3ke35s35*

*Please ensure to go through the FAQ document before the next stage and refer the same to your family as it has answers to most of the queries.* Furthermore, if you have any other queries I would suggest that you note them down and we will discuss them in the next session.

Let me also share a few pictures of the students who are studying in India through the Edoofa Program so that you can witness the exposures and their experiences.

05/02/24, 9:03 am - Arshita: Heartiest congratulations to you and your family, @263773449402 @263772280071 and @263788297321 *as your application was found to be eligible for the Edoofa Scholarship Program. I have been so happy, the moment I saw you passed the eligibility check stage👏🏽👏🏽.* 

Since the results were shared over email, you are supposed to acknowledge them as well.

For your convenience, let me share the Letter of Acceptance for Nothando over here as well so that you can go through.
05/02/24, 9:04 am - Arshita: <Media omitted>
05/02/24, 1:08 pm - +263 77 344 9402: Well received with thanks. 

We are however concerned about the following, after going through the Acceptance Letter...

1. The specifications concerning the amount of scholarship. It not easy to plan with a scholarship that ranges from 60-100%. We would be conformable knowing exact figures from which she can anticipate to cover the remaining costs using Earn While You Learn Program.

2. You stated that the degree to be pursued could by changed upon admission. We are aware of our daughter's capabilities and that she can successfully pursue a career in law. Having her to potentially change her program upon admission is not safe for her because we wanted security on that before proceeding further. Once she lands in India it won't be easy to come back having failed to secure the program she initially applied for.

3. The cost of just securing the scholarship is prohibitive for someone who is already in need of assistance. A local top  university would prove rather much cheaper. India is rated among the best especially its Law Degree Programs and students find it easy to secure employment after completing their studies there.  Our wish was to have her get a Law Degree from India but under lighter  financial conditions.  

We are however very grateful for the opportunity you accorded us. We are a family that does not fit into the category of applicants you are looking for because our finances are not within your range. Children from poor backgrounds tend to work extra hard because they are aware of their parents financial backgrounds. The only way to get ahead is to work extra hard to secure full  scholarships and bursaries to help their parents lessen the burden of the cost of acquiring professional qualifications. 

Stay blessed
05/02/24, 1:30 pm - Arshita: Please excuse me for some time as I am heading for my lunch. Let us connect at 02:30 pm CAT for the next part of our session. Let me know if you have any challenges with the schedule. 

Meanwhile, you can go through our Social Media pages to learn more about the experiences of Edoofians and the program!

05/02/24, 1:33 pm - +263 77 344 9402: I have no problem with the schedule.
05/02/24, 1:37 pm - Arshita: Mr. Stephen let me help you over here please. I believe you are getting confused with a few of the statements whereas the same was being explained in the Counselling Session!
05/02/24, 1:38 pm - Arshita: Addressing the first question of yours, I would first like you to please understand that Edoofa is not an Agent wherein we are only associated with 1 University. If that would have been the case I would have told you the exact fees during the counseling session itself, the reason I shared the annual fees in a range is that Edoofa is associated with 250+ UGC-recognized universities and that is why we are able to reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $2000-$3000 a year, which includes their *Accommodation, Food, and Basic University Expenses for the year as well*, and  *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
05/02/24, 1:38 pm - Arshita: Now what you have is a very common question that any family member of the student has is why aren't they told of a fixed annual fee beforehand so that they could plan for the cost properly. I am sure similar might have been your concern as well, which is why I would again like to bring it to your knowledge that Edoofa is not an Agent that is only associated with 1 University. 

Through Edoofa a student interacts with multiple Universities during their University Interaction Stage which is Step 5 of the Edoofa Cycle as well.
05/02/24, 1:38 pm - Arshita: Now it is obvious that every university would evaluate a student's application differently which means, after the University interaction, when the student receives multiple offer letters stating the exact quantum of scholarship from the universities, the student and the family members are given full liberty to choose a University based on the Quantum of scholarship they have provided to the student itself. This way the parents and the student gets to choose the most affordable higher education as per their own financial plans.
05/02/24, 1:39 pm - Arshita: Despite the same, as you can see it is clearly mentioned that as per Nothando's eligibility check evaluation her annual fee will be within the range of $1200 to $1800 inclusive of all the above mentioned aspect for the entire year.
05/02/24, 1:41 pm - +263 77 344 9402: Thank you.
05/02/24, 1:43 pm - Arshita: Question number 2. The statement is not applicable for students who have secured their seats, this particular statement in Nothando's letter of Acceptance is indicating towards the fact that if a student upon securing their scholarship while being in their home country or in India wishes to change their course, then they would have to follow a set procedure for the same. 

Moreover this statement also signifies, for the students who apply for a particular year of intake later on. As you know, every course has a limited scholarship seats, now if a student applies at last towards their admission intake, then the Board has the right to change the course upon their eligibility check evaluation depending upon the availability of the remaining scholarship seats. 

For example, currently there are only 279 seats left for the course of Law for 2024 Academic Intake. Now once these 279 seats are reserved by the students, in that case 280th student would have to apply for another course that would be clearly mentioned in the Letter of Acceptance of the student
05/02/24, 1:44 pm - Arshita: *Mr Stephen in no case, would the course mentioned in the Letter of Acceptance and University Offer Letter be different until and unless the student and family has requested for the same*
05/02/24, 1:46 pm - Arshita: Talking about the 3rd point Mr Stephen, what you are sharing is partly correct. You see Our Senior Academician was in Zimbabwe for 4 months last year and let me highlight the importance of this opportunity for Zimbabwean students. I want you to think about this situation, where you are studying at UZ. The Tuition fee at UZ ranges from $1200-$1500 from 2024 Academic Intake with hikes continuously over the years. The living expenses in Zimbabwe are much more costly than in India. Even the staple diet sadza costs $1 per meal. So you have to spend around $3 per or more per day for meals. A taxi ride for a short distance costs $1, Wi-Fi costs $120 per month, the living rents are high with hikes and the unemployment rates are increasing. Many students work at petrol pumps, markets, selling SIM cards etc after graduation. You might have observed this. All in all, students studying in Zimbabwe have informed us they have to meet an expense of about $3000 or more per annum.
05/02/24, 1:47 pm - Arshita: Mind you this is not a constant cost since back in February 2023, cost of buying groceries was cheaper in Zimbabwe that what it is current, and you do know that.
05/02/24, 1:48 pm - +263 77 344 9402: Thank you.
05/02/24, 1:49 pm - +263 77 344 9402: Thank you for your clarifications.
05/02/24, 1:54 pm - Arshita: So if we calculate just the tuition fee investment of a parent over the next 4 years of education in Zimbabwe. With an optimistic 20% inflation whereas as per the economic data inflation has been over 35-40% year on year.

Year 1:- $1500
Year 2:- $1800
Year 3:- $2180
Year 4:- $2617

Total tuition fee paid over the 4 year period= $8097
05/02/24, 1:56 pm - Arshita: Now as a parent you do understand that cost of living near UZ current is around $150-$200 a month which will make it $1800-$2000 a year, 

Then cost of fooding minimum $3 a day would make it $1500 a year. 

Then miscellaneous expenses like internet and airtime, which would cost a minimum of $20-$35 a month, meaning $250-$420 a year.
05/02/24, 1:57 pm - Arshita: So all in all if you calculate, with the current economic outlook, it is actually 1.5 to 2 times expensive for a parent to let their child study in Zimbabwe as compared to the opportunity of Edoofa.
05/02/24, 1:58 pm - Arshita: I am sure being a well read person you and Mrs Mpofu would have your thoughts regarding the same, do share with me what do you feel about the same?
05/02/24, 2:00 pm - +263 77 344 9402: Thank you. I will get back to you.
05/02/24, 2:07 pm - Arshita: Sure @263773449402, I would expect to hear from you!
06/02/24, 9:22 am - Arshita: Greetings @263773449402 @263772280071 and @263788297321 ! 

How are you doing today?
