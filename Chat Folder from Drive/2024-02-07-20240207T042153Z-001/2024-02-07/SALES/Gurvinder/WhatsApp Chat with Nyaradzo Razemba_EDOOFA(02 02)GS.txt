*When you step into this day realize that you have immense opportunities! All you need to do is give your best to grab it.*

With all positive energy, I am here to continue our interactive session.
03/02/24, 11:45 am - +263 78 616 6315: Ok sir ...um ready
03/02/24, 12:04 pm - Gurvinder: Alright, so Nyaradzo, I can see you got to know about the Edoofa Program from Ruth, is that correct?

03/02/24, 12:32 pm - +263 78 616 6315: Thank you so much  sir....

I göt little and helpful information about the edoofa program which really raised my zeal and motivation.....


I was told that this program is there to assist the disadvantaged and those who re eager to learn...

And it helps also to go abroad for better quality of education....

I also learnt that it is a learn while u earn program that boost experience and finance as well for advanced social services....



Thats more of what l hve gathered up till now...

Thank you sir...
03/02/24, 12:56 pm - Gurvinder: That is correct, let me brief you more.
03/02/24, 12:56 pm - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
03/02/24, 12:56 pm - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
03/02/24, 12:56 pm - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
03/02/24, 12:56 pm - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
03/02/24, 2:58 pm - +263 78 616 6315: Oooh yes
03/02/24, 2:58 pm - +263 78 616 6315: Thank you...so much
03/02/24, 4:20 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so Nyaradzo, as we start your counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
03/02/24, 4:41 pm - +263 78 616 6315: I appreciate.....l am willing to go through counselling processes...
05/02/24, 8:15 am - Gurvinder: Good morning! Drawing inspiration from biblical wisdom: 

*"In the sacred texts, we find that knowledge is a faithful companion, elevating one to respect beyond borders. Education outshines both beauty and youth."*

Let's fuel our positive energy and continue our interactive session.
05/02/24, 8:34 am - +263 78 616 6315: Ok sir...l am ready...
05/02/24, 8:49 am - Gurvinder: Now Nyaradzo, I would like to know you better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about yourself, your career aspiration do include sharing about:-

1. Your highest education level?
2. The course you would like to study?
3. What do your parents do?
4. What is your parent’s highest education level?
5. Who has been supporting you for your Education so far?
6. Who will be supporting you financially for your higher education abroad?
7. Do you have any siblings? if yes, what do they do?
8. May I know which school do you study at and in which province is it located along with that how much was your per-term fee in A level?

Please elaborate on your answers and answer them in points, so that I can understand your application more briefly and assist you in a better way

*“Education is the passport to the future, for tomorrow belongs to those who prepare for it today.” —Malcolm X"*

*When you step into this day realize that you have immense opportunities! All you need to do is give your best to grab it.*

With all positive energy, I am here to continue our interactive session.
06/02/24, 10:00 am - +263 78 616 6315: Good morning sir.. lam ready for the session
06/02/24, 10:44 am - Gurvinder: It is a pleasure to know you Nyaradzo.
06/02/24, 10:45 am - Gurvinder: May I know, what were your plans for higher education, before knowing about the Edoofa scholarship program?
06/02/24, 3:33 pm - +263 78 616 6315: Thank you sir....


I had huge dreams and aspirations for higher education....l always fought for better results during my tears of learning...  I hoped to work after my advanced level inorder to meet my tertiary educational needs but unfortunately um still unemployed duë to economic structures which are poor....


Nowadays l realize that education is the key to success that is why l put much effort in applying scholarship once l found out about the edoofa program...which was and still my biggest aspiration and aim


Thank you
06/02/24, 3:38 pm - Gurvinder: I admire your aspirations Nyaradzo, but I would like to tell you that after the scholarship, the cost of education still comes down to $2000-3000 per year, do you think your parents can support you for that?
06/02/24, 3:41 pm - +263 78 616 6315: Right now...my mother who is my only parent is unemployed and l dont have anyone to support me with all such costs...that is the reason why l am looking for a 100% scholarship
06/02/24, 3:45 pm - Gurvinder: Nyaradzo, even if you manage to get a 100% scholarship, that would be on the tuition fees and you still would have to pay for accommodation and food.
06/02/24, 3:51 pm - +263 78 616 6315: Ok sir thank you so much...for now l dont have anyone to support me with such needs....am really grateful torwards your help and concern so far...
06/02/24, 3:52 pm - Gurvinder: Please connect back when you think you have someone who can support you for that.
06/02/24, 4:06 pm - +263 78 616 6315: Ok sir....thank you so much...
