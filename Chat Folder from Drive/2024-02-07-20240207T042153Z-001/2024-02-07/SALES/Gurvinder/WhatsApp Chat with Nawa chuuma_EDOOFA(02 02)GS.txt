I am Mr Gurvinder Singh, Senior Career Counselor at Edoofa

Welcome to the Edoofa Scholarship Counselling Session

Before we begin with the session, I would like to ask you, what prior understanding you have about the Edoofa Scholarship Program
02/02/24, 5:51 pm - +260 97 9371972: Hi
02/02/24, 5:57 pm - +260 97 9371972: That it helps people
02/02/24, 11:51 pm - Gurvinder: As tomorrow is a saturday, I would connect with you tomorrow again at 11AM CAT to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care.

Have a good day ahead. 
God Bless You!
03/02/24, 11:08 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning Everyone, 

*"The greatest glory in living lies not in never falling, but in rising every time we fall."*

*When you step into this day realize that you have immense opportunities! All you need to do is give your best to grab it.*

With all positive energy, I am here to continue our interactive session.
05/02/24, 8:13 am - Gurvinder: Good morning! Drawing inspiration from biblical wisdom: 

*"In the sacred texts, we find that knowledge is a faithful companion, elevating one to respect beyond borders. Education outshines both beauty and youth."*

Let's fuel our positive energy and continue our interactive session.
05/02/24, 10:12 pm - Gurvinder: Hi Dear, I hope you are doing well.

I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons that I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship. 

I hope to get a positive response from you soon.
06/02/24, 8:57 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning Nawa,
I would like you to come online and complete the counselling session today itself, or I would have to close your application due to you being not present for the session.
06/02/24, 11:06 pm - Gurvinder: Hi Dear, I hope you are in good health.

Since the time you applied for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, I was hoping to connect with you and take your application forward to check your eligibility for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, but since you didn’t respond, I am afraid I will have to put a formal closure to your application. Feel free to connect with me again, when you think you are ready to proceed further. 

Below is a video explaining the details of the Edoofa Program
