*I am Mr Gurvinder Singh, Senior Career Counselor at Edoofa*

We have received an application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program from your friend and our student.

I hope I have contacted the right person.

I would like you to come online so that I could discuss with you the form you submitted online and what I was able to understand from the same!
05/02/24, 10:10 am - +263 78 889 1027: Okay ...Hie
05/02/24, 10:15 am - Gurvinder: It is a pleasure to connect with you today Queen,

You can address me as Mr Gurvinder, we do have Mr Piiyush, Head of Counselling and  Mr Jyotishman, Head of Admissions who will be evaluating your responses for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
05/02/24, 10:16 am - +263 78 889 1027: Okay Sir noted
05/02/24, 10:21 am - Gurvinder: Alright, so Queen, I can see you got to know about the Edoofa Program from Blessing, is that correct?
05/02/24, 11:02 am - +263 78 889 1027: Yes
05/02/24, 11:03 am - Gurvinder: Okay, so can you tell me what all did you learn about the Edoofa Program from Blessing, also do tell me whether you learnt about Blessing’s Journey and Experience with the Edoofa Program?
05/02/24, 11:07 am - +263 78 889 1027: What l know is Edoofa Scholarship Program gives people the opportunity to study abroad
05/02/24, 11:07 am - +263 78 889 1027: I know nothing about Blessing's journey with the program
05/02/24, 11:08 am - +263 78 889 1027: I'm also looking forward to learning in India
05/02/24, 11:44 am - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the program.
05/02/24, 11:44 am - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
05/02/24, 11:44 am - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
05/02/24, 11:44 am - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
05/02/24, 11:44 am - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
05/02/24, 12:58 pm - +263 78 889 1027: Okay l get it
05/02/24, 12:59 pm - +263 78 889 1027: Yes that's true Sir
05/02/24, 1:16 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so Queen, as we start your counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
05/02/24, 1:21 pm - +263 78 889 1027: Yes l do but as of now l'm at school can l please let you know when l'm home so that l will tell my parents to come online as of now they are unreachable please
05/02/24, 1:22 pm - Gurvinder: That is not an issue right now.
05/02/24, 1:22 pm - Gurvinder: Now Queen, I would like to know you better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about yourself, your career aspiration do include sharing about:-

1. Your highest education level?
2. The course you would like to study?
3. What do your parents do?
4. What is your parent’s highest education level?
5. Who has been supporting you for your Education so far?
6. Who will be supporting you financially for your higher education abroad?
7. Do you have any siblings? if yes, what do they do?
8. May I know which school do you study at and in which province is it located along with that how much was your per-term fee in A level?

Please elaborate on your answers and answer them in points, so that I can understand your application more briefly and assist you in a better way
05/02/24, 1:22 pm - +263 78 889 1027: Okay thank you

*B.A. (Hons.) in Sociology*
06/02/24, 2:00 pm - +263 78 889 1027: Okay Sir no problem
06/02/24, 2:00 pm - Gurvinder: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.
06/02/24, 2:00 pm - Gurvinder: Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.
06/02/24, 2:02 pm - +263 78 889 1027: I am highly confident
06/02/24, 2:03 pm - Gurvinder: So shall I brief you about the course?
06/02/24, 2:03 pm - +263 78 889 1027: Yes please
06/02/24, 2:04 pm - Gurvinder: *B.A. (Hons.) in Sociology* is an undergraduate program that deals with various aspects of social behavior and its consequence on modern society.

06/02/24, 2:23 pm - +263 78 889 1027: Okay Sir
06/02/24, 2:57 pm - +263 78 889 1027: If given the opportunity to get into Edoofa's program l will focus on achieving my dream.This course will help me in deep understanding of human behaviour and society.It also helps in critical thinking and problem solving skills  which are essential in any career . If provided with this career l see myself as my role model Mother Theressa of Calcata as she is a heroine in humanitarian work.I would also like to thank the Indian Government for providing labour and serving the less privileged.Last but not least ,l will also be able to provide a safe and nurturing environment for the children who have been opharned or abandoned  and also understanding their behaviours.
06/02/24, 3:02 pm - Gurvinder: That is really great Queen I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations,

However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

Are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way inorder to transform your career dear?
06/02/24, 3:03 pm - +263 78 889 1027: I'm will try and give the best that l can
06/02/24, 3:04 pm - Gurvinder: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
06/02/24, 3:19 pm - +263 78 889 1027: It can boost one's career prospects as employers often review international experience as a positive attribute.Additionally my role model is from India ,l had always wished to visit India to witness myself how she managed from a humble start
06/02/24, 3:22 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
06/02/24, 3:40 pm - +263 78 889 1027: I can use my knowledge and skills to help develop and improve the education system in my country.Can also share my experiences with others and help to promote international understanding ,bring new technologies,methods or products to my home country.Last but not least l can use my knowledge to advocate for social or political change in my home country
06/02/24, 3:40 pm - Gurvinder: I appreciate your sense of hardworking for your community Queen, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?
06/02/24, 3:41 pm - +263 78 889 1027: I can also contribute through issuing consultance services, seminars,charity work.
06/02/24, 3:42 pm - +263 78 889 1027: I agree
06/02/24, 3:47 pm - Gurvinder: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
06/02/24, 3:48 pm - +263 78 889 1027: That's true
06/02/24, 3:50 pm - Gurvinder: You see Edoofa’s vision to provide every student with an education that is not just affordable but accessible and employable as well can only be achieved by utilizing the infrastructure of Indian Education landscape that has been developed over the last 75+ years since India’s Independence.
06/02/24, 3:50 pm - Gurvinder: *Following are the reasons as to Why Edoofa Focuses on India for Scholarships: A Quick Look!*
