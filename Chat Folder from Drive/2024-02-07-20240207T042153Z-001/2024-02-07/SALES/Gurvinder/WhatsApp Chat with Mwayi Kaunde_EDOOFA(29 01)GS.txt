30/01/24, 2:33 pm - Gurvinder added +265 897 61 86 86
30/01/24, 3:23 pm - +265 897 61 86 86: Hie
30/01/24, 3:24 pm - Gurvinder: It is a pleasure to connect with you today Mwayi,

You can address me as Mr Gurvinder, we do have Mr Piiyush, Head of Counselling and  Mr Jyotishman, Head of Admissions who will be evaluating your responses for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
30/01/24, 3:24 pm - +265 897 61 86 86: Sure
30/01/24, 3:25 pm - Gurvinder: Alright, so Mwayi, I can see you got to know about the Edoofa Program from Sarah, is that correct?
30/01/24, 3:26 pm - +265 897 61 86 86: Yes
30/01/24, 3:26 pm - Gurvinder: Okay, so can you tell me what all did you learn about the Edoofa Program from Sarah, also do tell me whether you learnt about Sarah’s Journey and Experience with the Edoofa Program?
30/01/24, 3:39 pm - +265 897 61 86 86: It's a program which offers scholarships to individuals from 50 to 100 percent
It helps in lack of affordability of education
It also believes that quality education should be accessible to all
30/01/24, 3:40 pm - Gurvinder: That is correct, let me brief you more.
30/01/24, 3:40 pm - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
30/01/24, 3:41 pm - Gurvinder: EDOOFA has commended the new government for its dedicated efforts and positive changes in the education sector, including the elimination of school fees, an increase in the number of teachers, and a focus on protecting vulnerable learners, particularly adolescent girls. *Edoofa is proud to support the government in its mission to transform the education sector and achieve sustainable development, aimed at ensuring quality education that is inclusive and equitable for all by 2030.*
30/01/24, 3:41 pm - Gurvinder: With the influx of students from Zimbabwe, we recorded more than 1500 students to the program in each of the last two years. Having a strong network and grasp of more than 100 schools with a panel of Headmasters, teachers, parents, and other educators, we now look to replicate our success in Malawi as well where we have already begun enrolling students since the last 6 months and we have closed 2023 intake with over 1500 students.
30/01/24, 3:41 pm - Gurvinder: *Our strong relationships with educational institutions, such as Beautiful Gate, Kingdom Builders Academy, Kings Foundation, and Michiru Secondary School, are a testament to the success of the Edoofa Scholarship Program throughout Malawi.*
30/01/24, 3:41 pm - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
30/01/24, 3:44 pm - +265 897 61 86 86: Yes
30/01/24, 3:45 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so Mwayi, as we start your counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
30/01/24, 3:46 pm - +265 897 61 86 86: Indeed
30/01/24, 3:46 pm - Gurvinder: Now Mwayi, I would like to know you better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about yourself, your career aspiration do include sharing about:-

1. Your highest education level?
2. The course you would like to study?
3. What do your parents do?
4. What is your parent’s highest education level?
5. Who has been supporting you for your Education so far?
6. Who will be supporting you financially for your higher education abroad?
7. Do you have any siblings? if yes, what do they do?
8. May I know which school do you study at and in which province is it located along with that how much was your per-term fee in A level?

Please elaborate on your answers and answer them in points, so that I can understand your application more briefly and assist you in a better way
30/01/24, 4:07 pm - +265 897 61 86 86: Now Mwayi, I would like to know you better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about yourself, your career aspiration do include sharing about:-

Have a good day ahead. 
God Bless You!
03/02/24, 11:12 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning Everyone, 

*"The greatest glory in living lies not in never falling, but in rising every time we fall."*

*When you step into this day realize that you have immense opportunities! All you need to do is give your best to grab it.*

With all positive energy, I am here to continue our interactive session.
03/02/24, 11:13 am - +265 897 61 86 86: Good morning
03/02/24, 11:38 am - Gurvinder: Well Mwayi as you mentioned that it is your desire to study medicine, but it is very unfortunate that we don't offer medicine as a course because of the following reasons:

1. Affordability: Medicine is one of the most expensive course everywhere in the world, as it requires high-class facilities and great doctors and mentors to teach that.

2. Eligibility: As you would have seen from the video, that India is a great place to study for higher education as it has both qualities of education and affordability, but for medicine in India, you need to give an entrance exam named NEET, which is very competitive and only 1000 students are selected from millions each year .

3. Length of the program: Medicine is 6-8years course including the internships that are mandatory, so it also contributes to the affordability issue
03/02/24, 11:38 am - Gurvinder: But I realize that you want to do a course that makes your parent proud and also align with your passion. So you can go ahead with the courses like

1. Bachelors in  Pharmacy
2. Bachelors in Physiotherapy
3. Bachelors in Optometry
4. Bachelors of Science in Medical Lab Technology

These courses have lesser duration than Medicine and are more affordable for students.
03/02/24, 11:55 am - +265 897 61 86 86: I have to think thoroughly first about the courses
03/02/24, 11:58 am - +265 897 61 86 86: Because I have never about those courses before
03/02/24, 12:09 pm - Gurvinder: Noted, please take your time till Monday to decide.
03/02/24, 12:16 pm - +265 897 61 86 86: Sure
03/02/24, 12:16 pm - +265 897 61 86 86: Thanks
05/02/24, 8:14 am - Gurvinder: Good morning! Drawing inspiration from biblical wisdom: 

*"In the sacred texts, we find that knowledge is a faithful companion, elevating one to respect beyond borders. Education outshines both beauty and youth."*

Let's fuel our positive energy and continue our interactive session.
05/02/24, 10:23 pm - Gurvinder: Hi Dear, I hope you are doing well.

I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons that I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship. 

I hope to get a positive response from you soon.
05/02/24, 10:37 pm - +265 897 61 86 86: Hie
05/02/24, 10:38 pm - +265 897 61 86 86: Sorry for today
05/02/24, 10:39 pm - +265 897 61 86 86: It was a long day since I spent my entire day registering for an ID
06/02/24, 9:05 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning Mwayi,
I hope you doing great, please!
I would like you to come online and complete the counselling session today itself as you have been very inconsistent in these sessions.
06/02/24, 9:14 am - +265 897 61 86 86: Good morning
06/02/24, 10:14 am - Gurvinder: May I know, what have you decided?
06/02/24, 10:14 am - +265 897 61 86 86: Pharmacy
06/02/24, 10:48 am - Gurvinder: Let me help you with the eligibility consideration for Malawi

1 = distinction, 2 = distinction, 3 = credit, 4 = credit, 5 = credit, 6 = credit, 7 = pass, 8 = pass, 9 = fail

We accept upto 7=pass for a subject. Let us say a student has 5 subjects and scored 7 in all of them creating an aggregate of 35. This would be the maximum limit for eligibility. All students scoring an aggregate within this range would meet the academic requirement for the program. The minimum requirement was higher before the pandemic but during the pandemic, a lot of students failed to receive enough resources and Educational support which we had shared with the Universities and Ministries due to which the requirements have been lowered but I always encourage my students to target for maximum to increase the chances of Higher Quantum of Scholarship!

I believe you are confident about meeting the requirements and performing well in MSCE.
06/02/24, 10:49 am - +265 897 61 86 86: Yes
06/02/24, 11:53 am - Gurvinder: So shall I brief you about the course?
06/02/24, 11:54 am - +265 897 61 86 86: Yes

06/02/24, 12:36 pm - +265 897 61 86 86: Yes
06/02/24, 12:38 pm - Gurvinder: Since you have understood the course properly can you now tell me in 150 to 200 words that if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself 5 years after the completion of this course and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?

06/02/24, 1:15 pm - Gurvinder: That is really great Mwayi I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations,

However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

Are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way inorder to transform your career dear?
06/02/24, 1:15 pm - +265 897 61 86 86: It also offers enough resources to aid in education.This will help in my studies since I'll be able to acquire more knowledge . This will help me excel in my studies hence achieving my dreams
06/02/24, 1:16 pm - +265 897 61 86 86: Very willing
06/02/24, 1:17 pm - +265 897 61 86 86: And I'll will work extra harder than 200 percent
06/02/24, 1:26 pm - Gurvinder: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
06/02/24, 1:55 pm - +265 897 61 86 86: There is a well developed pharmaceutical industry and there are better resources and facilities hence providing a better conducive environment for learning than here
06/02/24, 1:57 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
06/02/24, 2:06 pm - +265 897 61 86 86: Abroad I'll be exposed to new ideas in which I'll shall share with others in my home country.This will help advance people's skills and knowledge here hence developing pharmacy here
06/02/24, 2:09 pm - Gurvinder: I appreciate your sense of hardworking for your community Mwayi, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?
06/02/24, 2:11 pm - +265 897 61 86 86: Yes
06/02/24, 2:12 pm - Gurvinder: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
06/02/24, 2:15 pm - +265 897 61 86 86: Yes
06/02/24, 2:19 pm - Gurvinder: You see Edoofa’s vision to provide every student with an education that is not just affordable but accessible and employable as well can only be achieved by utilizing the infrastructure of Indian Education landscape that has been developed over the last 75+ years since India’s Independence.

06/02/24, 2:31 pm - Gurvinder: So now Mwayi, I hope you must have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead. As of now would you like to ask anything so far?
06/02/24, 2:31 pm - +265 897 61 86 86: Thanks for sharing the fascinating facts about India
06/02/24, 2:34 pm - +265 897 61 86 86: Nmthanks for asking but I don't have a question
06/02/24, 2:34 pm - +265 897 61 86 86: No*
06/02/24, 2:34 pm - Gurvinder: So now moving ahead by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India?
06/02/24, 2:43 pm - +265 897 61 86 86: No
06/02/24, 2:44 pm - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
06/02/24, 2:44 pm - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
06/02/24, 2:44 pm - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
06/02/24, 2:45 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
06/02/24, 2:45 pm - Gurvinder: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year, but as some courses are niche in nature like **Bachelor of Pharmacy(B.Pharm.)** itself is a course which has fewer scholarship seats, which is why for you the Annual fee after the scholarship would be between *$2700-$3700*. This cost includes:
	1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)
	2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)
	3. Food
	4. Accommodation
*after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
06/02/24, 4:17 pm - +265 897 61 86 86: Okay
06/02/24, 4:18 pm - Gurvinder: So now shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?
06/02/24, 4:20 pm - +265 897 61 86 86: Yes
06/02/24, 4:21 pm - Gurvinder: Mwayi, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
06/02/24, 4:26 pm - +265 897 61 86 86: Thanks
06/02/24, 4:27 pm - Gurvinder: The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

06/02/24, 4:27 pm - Gurvinder: *2. Recruitment Partners: -*

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-

06/02/24, 4:28 pm - Gurvinder: *3. Webinars: -*

06/02/24, 4:28 pm - Gurvinder: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase. 

*What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
06/02/24, 4:30 pm - +265 897 61 86 86: Indeed it will benefit me
06/02/24, 4:31 pm - Gurvinder: I am delighted to hear that Mwayi, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
06/02/24, 4:33 pm - +265 897 61 86 86: Okay
06/02/24, 4:35 pm - +265 897 61 86 86: But I'm not getting on what type of work people do in the course of earning as you work
06/02/24, 11:08 pm - Gurvinder: Well Dear, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you tomorrow again at 11AM CAT to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care.

Have a good day ahead. 
God Bless You!
