Welcome to the Edoofa Scholarship Counselling Session

Before we begin with the session, I would like to ask you, what prior understanding you have about the Edoofa Scholarship Program
12/01/24, 9:11 am - +260 97 7887663: What time is a session?
12/01/24, 9:18 am - +260 777692570: I personally  think it's a program aimed at making students  achieve  wat they wish to do  in life with there careers  world wide I feel like it's  main goal is improving a child's  ability  and skills to help a a specific  country in one way or another  . That's  in my on way of understanding      Mr Gurvinder sing 
Thank you
12/01/24, 9:50 am - Gurvinder: Noted, let me brief you about the program myself.
12/01/24, 9:50 am - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
12/01/24, 9:50 am - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
12/01/24, 9:50 am - Gurvinder: EDOOFA has commended the new government for its dedicated efforts and positive changes in the education sector, including the elimination of school fees, an increase in the number of teachers, and a focus on protecting vulnerable learners, particularly adolescent girls. *Edoofa is proud to support the government in its mission to transform the education sector and achieve sustainable development, aimed at ensuring quality education that is inclusive and equitable for all by 2030.*
12/01/24, 9:50 am - Gurvinder: With the influx of students from Zimbabwe, we recorded more than 1500 students to the program in each of the last two years. Having a strong network and grasp of more than 100 schools with a panel of Headmasters, teachers, parents, and other educators, we now look to replicate our success in Zambia as well where we have already begun enrolling students since the last 6 months and we have closed 2023 intake with over 1500 students.
12/01/24, 9:50 am - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
12/01/24, 9:50 am - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
12/01/24, 9:50 am - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
12/01/24, 9:55 am - +260 777692570: Yes sir that is true...
12/01/24, 9:57 am - +260 777692570: I have a question  though
12/01/24, 11:18 am - Gurvinder: Yes, please share your concern.
12/01/24, 11:19 am - +260 777692570: So when likely  are selections happening  and school enrollment  too
12/01/24, 12:05 pm - Gurvinder: Please, the University enrollments have started.
12/01/24, 12:11 pm - +260 777692570: So how does one enroll
12/01/24, 12:36 pm - Gurvinder: Please do not worry, this is a counselling session, you will be guided for everything.
12/01/24, 12:37 pm - +260 777692570: Alright sir
12/01/24, 12:55 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so Abigail, as we start your counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
12/01/24, 12:56 pm - +260 777692570: Yes very much
12/01/24, 1:12 pm - Gurvinder: Now Abigail, I would like to know you better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about yourself, your career aspiration do include sharing about:-

1. Your highest education level?
2. The course you would like to study?
3. What do your parents do?
4. What is your parent’s highest education level?
5. Who has been supporting you for your Education so far?
6. Who will be supporting you financially for your higher education abroad?
7. Do you have any siblings? if yes, what do they do?
8. May I know which school do you study at and in which province is it located along with that how much was your per-term fee in grade 12?

Please elaborate on your answers and answer them in points, so that I can understand your application more briefly and assist you in a better way

15/01/24, 4:15 pm - Gurvinder: That is really great Abigail I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations,

However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

Are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way inorder to transform your career dear?
15/01/24, 4:18 pm - +260 777692570: Yes am willing  to put my all because  I know it won't  be easy
15/01/24, 4:18 pm - Gurvinder: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
15/01/24, 4:22 pm - +260 777692570: Well Firstly  I want  to learn another way of living interact with others
Learn a new culture  
Gain a global perspective  and just enhance my capabilities
15/01/24, 4:22 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
15/01/24, 4:38 pm - +260 777692570: The many we are in this program  the  more we would want to introduce  it to other Zambians 
Once am fully  done with the couser I've  chosen I would  build some medical industries  in my country and just employ some people  and then then least have a learning  institution  on how we can build  a better Zambia
15/01/24, 4:38 pm - Gurvinder: I appreciate your sense of hardworking for your community Abigail, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?
15/01/24, 4:39 pm - +260 777692570: Yes I do
15/01/24, 4:40 pm - Gurvinder: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
15/01/24, 4:42 pm - +260 777692570: Yes actually  thank you for bringing  that up
15/01/24, 4:42 pm - +260 777692570: Why India?
15/01/24, 4:42 pm - Gurvinder: You see Edoofa’s vision to provide every student with an education that is not just affordable but accessible and employable as well can only be achieved by utilizing the infrastructure of Indian Education landscape that has been developed over the last 75+ years since India’s Independence.

15/01/24, 10:11 pm - +260 777692570: Goodnight
16/01/24, 8:46 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

*“The best way to predict your future is to create it."*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
16/01/24, 8:51 am - +260 777692570: Goodmorning
16/01/24, 9:28 am - Gurvinder: So now Abigail, I hope you must have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead. As of now would you like to ask anything so far?
16/01/24, 10:01 am - +260 777692570: Yes
16/01/24, 10:02 am - +260 777692570: Why did you decide to include Zambia in this program
16/01/24, 10:23 am - Gurvinder: Abigail, Education is do available in Zambia, but the fact that employability after education is an issue that is why we are in Zambia to provide an education that is superior and more employable for students like you.
16/01/24, 10:30 am - +260 777692570: That's  the only  question  I had
16/01/24, 10:52 am - Gurvinder: So now moving ahead by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India?
16/01/24, 10:56 am - +260 777692570: Mmm no
16/01/24, 12:18 pm - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
16/01/24, 12:18 pm - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
16/01/24, 12:18 pm - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
16/01/24, 12:18 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
16/01/24, 12:18 pm - Gurvinder: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*

*after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
16/01/24, 2:22 pm - +260 777692570: Okay 
Understood
16/01/24, 2:23 pm - Gurvinder: So now shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?
16/01/24, 2:31 pm - +260 777692570: Yes please
16/01/24, 2:41 pm - Gurvinder: Abigail, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
16/01/24, 2:43 pm - +260 777692570: Alright
16/01/24, 2:51 pm - Gurvinder: The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

*1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-_*Africa Global Radio*_ - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0

-_*Skooqs*_ - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
16/01/24, 2:51 pm - Gurvinder: *2. Recruitment Partners: -*

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
16/01/24, 2:51 pm - Gurvinder: *3. Webinars: -*

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
_Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world_ by *Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade*.
_How to network like a boss_ by *Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi*

16/01/24, 2:51 pm - Gurvinder: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase. 

*What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
16/01/24, 3:59 pm - +260 777692570: My  view 
I feel  like  it's  good program giving  a chance to make us achieve  our goals and dream and that it's  also concerned about how one is growing  academically  
It also improves  skills and enhances so many ability  due to the scholarship people  don't  really  have to worry about payments and such




And yes I really  do feel it will benefit  me
16/01/24, 4:00 pm - Gurvinder: I am delighted to hear that Abigail, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
16/01/24, 4:02 pm - +260 777692570: Okayyy
16/01/24, 4:04 pm - Gurvinder: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

16/01/24, 4:04 pm - Gurvinder: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
16/01/24, 4:05 pm - +260 777692570: Exactly  it is
16/01/24, 4:06 pm - +260 777692570: This is really  impressive
16/01/24, 4:10 pm - Gurvinder: Alright Abigail, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
16/01/24, 4:14 pm - +260 777692570: What of the program
16/01/24, 4:16 pm - Gurvinder: Are we not supporting you by reducing the cost to $2000-3000, and then we give you a chance to reduce it more by the EWYL program, so for the rest, will not your parents support you?
16/01/24, 4:17 pm - +260 777692570: They will
17/01/24, 8:33 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

*“There are no secrets to success. It is the result of preparation, hard work, and learning from failure."*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
17/01/24, 8:35 am - +260 777692570: Goodmorning
17/01/24, 8:52 am - Gurvinder: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
17/01/24, 8:53 am - +260 777692570: Yes
17/01/24, 9:03 am - Gurvinder: Abigail as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
17/01/24, 9:05 am - +260 777692570: 1000 - 2250 I assume
17/01/24, 9:12 am - Gurvinder: Exactly Abigail, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
17/01/24, 9:12 am - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
17/01/24, 9:13 am - +260 777692570: Oh okay
17/01/24, 9:13 am - Gurvinder: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
17/01/24, 9:13 am - +260 777692570: Where are the payments  made
17/01/24, 9:13 am - +260 777692570: Yes
17/01/24, 9:28 am - Gurvinder: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
17/01/24, 9:29 am - Gurvinder: Basically, there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee, before their Grade 12 result is out).


Phase 3: Once the final grade 12 results are out, if the student would have passed the necessary requirement (of 4 Grade 12 passes.) then start with their University Interaction. If the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents.


The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.

However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
17/01/24, 9:42 am - +260 777692570: Okay
17/01/24, 9:59 am - Gurvinder: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.

Are you familiar with the Edoofa Cycle?
17/01/24, 10:07 am - +260 777692570: <Media omitted>
17/01/24, 10:07 am - +260 777692570: This one
17/01/24, 10:12 am - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
17/01/24, 10:12 am - Gurvinder: Alright Abigail, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zambia itself.
17/01/24, 10:13 am - Gurvinder: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
17/01/24, 10:16 am - +260 777692570: Yes
17/01/24, 10:18 am - Gurvinder: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of the registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
17/01/24, 10:18 am - Gurvinder: Basically, this registration fee will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August/September 2024 and the remaining in January next year 2025.
17/01/24, 10:18 am - Gurvinder: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
17/01/24, 10:18 am - Gurvinder: So now would you like to ask anything?
17/01/24, 10:22 am - +260 777692570: No all good
17/01/24, 10:25 am - Gurvinder: Okay so with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check
17/01/24, 10:25 am - Gurvinder: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
17/01/24, 10:25 am - Gurvinder: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

*"Do the best you can until you know better. Then when you know better, do better. "*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
24/01/24, 8:39 am - +260 777692570: Alright
24/01/24, 8:45 am - Gurvinder added Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor
24/01/24, 8:46 am - Gurvinder: *@260977887663*,  I am happy to see that you understand the program details so well. I totally understand that you have work to do and So I really appreciate your cooperation and the time you are taking out to support your child.
24/01/24, 8:46 am - Gurvinder: Please note that the number of scholarship seats is limited in number, and in case *Abigail* is selected for the scholarship we expect that you are clear and aware of all the details shared during the session along with that you also obey the rules and honour the scholarship terms.
24/01/24, 8:46 am - Gurvinder: In case you do not follow these terms then *Abigail’s* entire scholarship process will go into backlog and you will only be able to apply for the scholarship after 6 months. By then the entire fee structure for the scholarship program may increase*.
24/01/24, 9:01 am - +260 97 7887649: Noted
24/01/24, 9:15 am - Gurvinder: Ideally, as you know, the tentative dates are:
1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the *30th or 31st of January 2024* for $200 and the *30th or 31st of February 2024* for the remaining $150.
2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the *30th or 31st of January 2024*
Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?
24/01/24, 9:43 am - +260 97 7887663: Well noted
24/01/24, 9:50 am - Gurvinder: Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?
24/01/24, 5:52 pm - Gurvinder: Are we still connected?
24/01/24, 6:03 pm - +260 777692570: Daddy?
24/01/24, 6:11 pm - Gurvinder: Yes, are your parents active?
24/01/24, 6:12 pm - +260 777692570: I guess not
24/01/24, 6:14 pm - Gurvinder: Can you please call them and ask to be active, as today I am extending my working hours to help you Fastrack the admission process.
24/01/24, 6:14 pm - +260 97 7887663: Am here
24/01/24, 6:14 pm - Gurvinder: So can you please address this.
24/01/24, 6:16 pm - +260 97 7887663: That is not a problem but am of view that we wait for her results and look at the entry point in course of study.
24/01/24, 6:17 pm - +260 97 7887663: Am sure those Universities demands certain qualifications in terms of G12 points obtained.
24/01/24, 6:37 pm - Gurvinder: Please, if a student fails to match these requirements, the students are given the option to get in the next intake too, plus let us imagine, if the student enrols now, he gets to start the EWYL program, and suppose the student manages to earn $100 per month through that, he can basically earn the fees of their whole first year through scholarship credits, so don't you think this will help you a lot financially rather than waiting for whole year?
24/01/24, 6:41 pm - +260 97 7887663: It is sir and I agree with you. We would like our daughter to start even this year but my concern is what have registered above.
24/01/24, 6:43 pm - Gurvinder: Are you talking about this?
24/01/24, 6:43 pm - +260 97 7887663: Results are coming soon. And if she is to fly to India traveling logistics needs to be put in place and wouldn't want to rush things but rather wait and receive results and begin to each other. Precisely next year intake would be better for her. Or rather if her results will be better we can then work within the cloak to push her
24/01/24, 6:49 pm - Gurvinder: Please even if she has to come to India even if this year, the intake is for August which gives you enough time to handle everything and right now you just have to worry about the enrollment, and if you face any financial issue, we give you the option to push the intake to next year too, and if you are worried about the admission, as mentioned in the counselling session, enrolling with this program will guarantee her an admission in the University, We are not admission agents, we are a family, which stays with the student till end of their educational journey, giving them a chance to self finance their education, teaching them responsibility and job essential skills, We believe in giving student an education that is accessible, affordable, and employable, but I personally believe that it is not employability that we provide, but we make them future leaders, and Abigail is one student that I find fit for this program, so that is why I am going an extra mile, stretching my working hours to work with you to get her an education that she deserves. <This message was edited>
24/01/24, 6:51 pm - +260 97 7887663: I hear you sir
24/01/24, 6:52 pm - +260 97 7887663: Will look into that
24/01/24, 6:54 pm - Gurvinder: So can you address this, as these are just tentative dates and not the real deadline?

24/01/24, 7:04 pm - +260 97 7887663: Will look into it sir
24/01/24, 7:06 pm - Gurvinder: Noted, please sleep on the decision and let me know in the morning as I don't want the extra burden of reapplication fees as your daughter reached the eligibility check evaluation, and for any concerns I am here for you parents as it is my duty as your child's counsellor.

31/01/24, 10:14 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning @260777692570 @260977887663
31/01/24, 10:14 am - Gurvinder: I hope you are doing well please?
31/01/24, 10:41 am - +260 777692570: Goodmorning
31/01/24, 10:41 am - +260 777692570: Yessss
31/01/24, 10:42 am - +260 777692570: I hope you're  fine too
My parents  have been  busy of late
31/01/24, 10:42 am - Gurvinder: Abigail, I do understand that, I hope by now your family has thoroughly discussed your Letter of Acceptance properly please?
31/01/24, 10:42 am - +260 777692570: Yes we have
31/01/24, 10:44 am - Gurvinder: So far is there anything you or your parents would like to ask from the Letter of Acceptance?
31/01/24, 11:27 am - +260 777692570: I don't  think so
31/01/24, 11:56 am - +260 97 7887663: Am on we can chat
31/01/24, 12:01 pm - +260 97 7887663: We are fine with a letter sir
31/01/24, 12:05 pm - Gurvinder: That is great @260977887663, so as you must have seen, there are two modes of fee payments mentioned:-

1. Direct Bank Transfer to our Parent Company's account
2. Deposit in our associate's account over there in Zimbabwe

Which mode according to you would be convenient, so that I can brief you in-depth about that particular mode?
31/01/24, 12:08 pm - +260 97 7887663: Looking into the money issues. But would want to know things like flight charge, accommodation, scholarship awarded. This will help in planning
31/01/24, 12:10 pm - Gurvinder: @260977887663 do you recall I briefed you that annual fee after scholarship includes accommodation, food and basic university expenses for the entire year please?
31/01/24, 12:12 pm - +260 97 7887663: That was taken care of but was thinking the acceptance letter will explain scholarship percentage and other requirements.
31/01/24, 12:13 pm - +260 97 7887663: I received a call from Zambian agent though was in the middle of something we could not talk.
31/01/24, 12:14 pm - +260 97 7887663: For me that is important. Let us now move out from our counseling session to real thing like a written document that will explain it all. The Zambian can as well give us the flight estimate cost.
31/01/24, 12:15 pm - +260 97 7887663: I can pay for registration but fail to meet other requirements
31/01/24, 12:15 pm - Gurvinder: Meanwhile, If you understand the concept of international education finances that play a major role are not visa fees and flight tickets. The flight ticket is required a very limited number of times as the students don't travel that often. I don't mean to say that students can not go back to their country, they can definitely go back to enjoy the holidays. What I have personally seen is, the students do not travel that often.

So, considering the main finance which plays the most important role in international education is the annual fees. So, to reduce this annual fee, Edoofa helps a student with the Earn While You Learn Program. This program provides the students with an opportunity to earn scholarship credits which in return help them to make their education more affordable.

Visa fees and flight tickets are to be bought just a month before they plan to come to India. So, let's say the student wants to come to India in August 2024, This means that his family has to cater the Visa fee and the ticket in July 2024. If you understand the concept properly, till July 2024, the student will be working in the Earn While You Learn program and will be earning Scholarship credits. Now, with this opportunity, you can save a lot of money on the annual fee which in return helps you to make your flight ticket and the Visa fee affordable.

As mentioned to you already, the scholarship covers the tuition fees as you see, the Edoofa scholarship is basically the scholarship seats acquired from the universities for their good work in the past 14 + years in the higher education space. So the travel costs will have to be covered by the student, But our admission team assist you in all the steps. So that you get the cheapest air travel tickets and also easily acquire the visa.

The cost for both the visa and flight cost will be around $500-$600, But you need not worry about that yet as you will be coming to India in the month of July-August next year as per your preparations
31/01/24, 12:19 pm - +260 97 7887663: Sounds good. Point taken and will look into it
31/01/24, 12:20 pm - Gurvinder: Can you elaborate @260977887663?
31/01/24, 12:23 pm - +260 97 7887663: The process you have explained it all. That information is what I wanted.
31/01/24, 12:23 pm - +260 97 7887663: Fine with us
31/01/24, 12:23 pm - +260 97 7887663: Bank transfer
31/01/24, 12:24 pm - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about this mode in depth please!
31/01/24, 12:25 pm - +260 97 7887663: Ok
31/01/24, 12:45 pm - +260 97 7887663: Waiting
31/01/24, 12:47 pm - Gurvinder: @260977887663, talking about the first mode, which is the Direct Bank transfer in our Account, basically because of the cash crisis in Zambia, there are a limited Banks which allow International Transfer. If you have an account in any of those Banks then the transaction charges will then be $35 to $50 USD for any amount upto $1000 depending upon the bank. Please note that $350 should also be in USD. In case you have Zambian Kwacha, you will have to exchange that with USD and transfer charges on *every transaction* would also be $35 to $50.

Therefore, the Bank Details that are to be used in this mode are:

Swift code: AXISINBB207
IFSC code: UTIB0001147
Bank Name: Axis Bank Ltd.
Account Name: Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd.
Current Account Number: 917020070183626
Bank's Name:  Axis Bank Ltd.
Bank’s Address: Janakpuri, B Block, New Delhi[DL]
Ground Floor & Basement, B-1/503, Janakpuri, New Delhi 110058
31/01/24, 12:53 pm - +260 97 7887663: So we are to pay $350
31/01/24, 12:54 pm - Gurvinder: If you pay $200 and $150, you would have to bear multiple charges in this mode @260977887663
31/01/24, 1:31 pm - Gurvinder: So @260977887663 is there anything you would like to ask please?
31/01/24, 1:31 pm - +260 777692570: His gone off
31/01/24, 1:32 pm - Gurvinder: Alright Abigail!
31/01/24, 1:33 pm - Gurvinder: Abigail, the due date of the formalities 3rd February, however it would be of great benefit for you incase you manage to complete a part of the formalities by today i.e 31st January.
31/01/24, 1:34 pm - Gurvinder: While I do understand that the deadline is of 3rd February, the key benefit for you as a child would have in this case would be to start the process early with the students who became a part of the Edoofa Program in the Month of January 2024. This inturn would help you to interact with the Admission Team even more early so that you can have a much better financial planning with them.
31/01/24, 1:42 pm - +260 777692570: Alright  sir  I've  heard u Loud and clear
31/01/24, 2:21 pm - Gurvinder: So @260777692570 I do understand it is quite in short, but would your parents be able to complete the required formalities by end of day today?
