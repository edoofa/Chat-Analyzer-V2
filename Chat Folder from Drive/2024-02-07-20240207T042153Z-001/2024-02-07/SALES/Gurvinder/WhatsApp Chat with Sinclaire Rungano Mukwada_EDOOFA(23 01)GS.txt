I am Mr Gurvinder Singh, Senior Career Counselor at Edoofa

Welcome to the Edoofa Scholarship Counselling Session

Before we begin with the session, I would like to ask you, what prior understanding you have about the Edoofa Scholarship Program
23/01/24, 8:52 am - +263 77 460 6508: Morning  sir ,this Edoofa schoolarship Program but I perceive this as a once in a lifetime apportunity that is being presented to not only me but to various  students around the world to be able to study I'm India not only that but also channels students forwards a worthy course n career .it offers schoolarships ranging from 50- 100% of tuition fees.The schoolarship is reliable and the proof is in those l have seen being upheld by this schoolarship from my former school.Edoofa schoolarship program  also encourages  focusing on building relevant skills which helps the students to thrive and survive in the future.
23/01/24, 9:06 am - Gurvinder: That is correct, let me brief you more.
23/01/24, 9:06 am - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
23/01/24, 9:06 am - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
23/01/24, 9:06 am - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
23/01/24, 9:06 am - +263 77 460 6508: Alright
23/01/24, 9:06 am - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
23/01/24, 9:07 am - +263 77 460 6508: Yes , no doubt sir
23/01/24, 9:24 am - Gurvinder: Okay so Sinclaire, as we start your counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
23/01/24, 9:25 am - +263 77 460 6508: Yes sir
23/01/24, 9:49 am - Gurvinder: Now Sinclaire, I would like to know you better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about yourself, your career aspiration do include sharing about:-

1. Your highest education level?

23/01/24, 12:45 pm - +263 77 460 6508: Well sir , my choice is being propelled by the desire to  make a difference which is not indirect  but rather a direct one , what difference  could  be more direct than helping  to save people's lives, alleviating their pain and suffering . There is no doubt there will be more of it , we have seen how diseases and malfunctions are increasing  by day  ,we have seen pandemics like Covid -19 .....there is no guarantee  that there won't be any such tragic events ...so l hv took it upon myself to be part of the "rescue team"

23/01/24, 1:28 pm - +263 77 460 6508: <Media omitted>

2023(form 6)
23/01/24, 1:48 pm - Gurvinder: Sinclaire, if you would have researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*. whereas if they want to study any Engineering Course then they should have *Physics, Chemistry and Maths* in their A level mandatorily.
23/01/24, 1:49 pm - Gurvinder: You see majority of the time students study subjects as per their country's requirements, therefore, the only courses left that these students could pursue ahead which would also align with the healthcare sector are 

1. Bachelor of Science in Nutrition and Dietetics

2. Bachelor of Science in Microbiology

3. Bachelor of Science in Medical Laboratory Technology

4. Bachelor of Science in Cardiovascular Technology

5. Bachelor of science in Physiotherapy

6.Bachelor of Science in Biotechnology

7. Bachelor of science in Biochemistry
23/01/24, 1:54 pm - +263 77 460 6508: I see , does this mean l have to choose only from the above sir?
23/01/24, 2:01 pm - Gurvinder: Yes, that is correct.
23/01/24, 2:03 pm - +263 77 460 6508: Alright , no problem
23/01/24, 2:05 pm - +263 77 460 6508: I seek permission to research a little on the given options ..10-15 minutes...may l?
23/01/24, 2:23 pm - Gurvinder: Yes, you can.
23/01/24, 2:38 pm - +263 77 460 6508: I have decided on 

4.Bachelor of science in Cardiovascular technology
23/01/24, 2:59 pm - Gurvinder: Noted.
23/01/24, 2:59 pm - Gurvinder: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.
23/01/24, 2:59 pm - Gurvinder: Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.
23/01/24, 3:14 pm - +263 77 460 6508: Fortunately l was able to attain all As in my final Advanced level examinations
23/01/24, 3:16 pm - Gurvinder: That is great, so shall I brief you about the course?
23/01/24, 3:16 pm - +263 77 460 6508: Sure

23/01/24, 3:20 pm - +263 77 460 6508: Following
23/01/24, 3:21 pm - Gurvinder: So did you understand the course?
23/01/24, 3:21 pm - +263 77 460 6508: Yes, l did
23/01/24, 3:22 pm - Gurvinder: Since you have understood the course properly can you now tell me in 150 to 200 words that if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself 5 years after the completion of this course and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
23/01/24, 3:23 pm - +263 77 460 6508: Sure ...
23/01/24, 4:02 pm - +263 77 460 6508: Bsc cardiovascular Technology , being a prestigious and opportunity-rich course ,l see myself in the midst of of reaching deeper depths in the post-course programs .l intend to do this while working  and l assume it may be difficult but l know  l have what it takes as l am a very hardworking somebody .l also recognise the high amount of income that comes with this carrer path and l visualise myself in a position to cater to my aging parents as well as financially  assisting  mu siblings  in their pursuit of careers of their own .Upon completion of higher courses ,l look forward to  developing of an institution which specialises in this cardiovascular technology sector because my mission  is to be more than just a cardiovascular technologist but l aim to sparehead an institution which would have a great impact whether in India or any other place I may reside.Lastly l believe all these ambitions would be made easier if l am part of the Edoofa's program.This is because l will be granted the opportunity to acquire knowledge in the best way l have ever known, "hands on knowledge "..and would be able to earn while l learn which would help me in being more independent  and simply the opportunity to experience the various cultures of students around the world included in the program. So it is by no doubt , get into the Edoofa's program would be a pivotal part in awakening my dreams .
23/01/24, 4:06 pm - Gurvinder: That is really great Sinclaire I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations,

However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

Are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way inorder to transform your career dear?
23/01/24, 4:09 pm - +263 77 460 6508: 250% sir , working hard is the only way l have known to live
23/01/24, 4:12 pm - Gurvinder: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
23/01/24, 4:24 pm - +263 77 460 6508: The issue is on my age , as I am growing  l seek not only tertiary education  l also seek exposure and more importantly  independence  .This has been difficult  as this independence comes with economic stability,  economic stability which comes from working  , well atleast  for a student part time working  and sadly  such opportunities  are scarce here in my country and l figured studying abroad would not only provided me with knowledge  but also a less' slim opportunity to earn  and this was the case even before I got a chance to know about  your program which is amazing because  it clearly  states "earn while you learn " which was something l was anticipating to work on it alone rather than a wonderful platform offering opportunities.
23/01/24, 4:30 pm - +263 77 460 6508: Another issue involves  less seats offered per year
23/01/24, 4:32 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
23/01/24, 5:03 pm - +263 77 460 6508: Good question sir , lucky it is something  that l as a young person have thought of and came to a conclusion that later on when I am most likely to take up a tutor or teaching  role and not only that but to also try and source donations - equipment  mainly which is short in our country  and the institution  I mentioned earlier would be the main source  of these funds
24/01/24, 8:52 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

*"Do the best you can until you know better. Then when you know better, do better. "*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
24/01/24, 8:53 am - +263 77 460 6508: Good morning
24/01/24, 9:11 am - Gurvinder: I appreciate your sense of hardworking for your community Sinclaire, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?
24/01/24, 9:13 am - +263 77 460 6508: I agree
24/01/24, 9:16 am - Gurvinder: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
24/01/24, 9:31 am - +263 77 460 6508: Yes , l remember hearing some bit of history and how india was a colony of the british but l also assume that part of the reason why  you recommend India because it was able quickly  recover and was able to make a name for itself in the health and engineering sector worldwide and how it has been able to channel reliable schoolarships through  its embassies ..
24/01/24, 9:46 am - Gurvinder: You see Edoofa’s vision to provide every student with an education that is not just affordable but accessible and employable as well can only be achieved by utilizing the infrastructure of Indian Education landscape that has been developed over the last 75+ years since India’s Independence.
24/01/24, 9:46 am - Gurvinder: *Following are the reasons as to Why Edoofa Focuses on India for Scholarships: A Quick Look!*

1. *Robust Education System:* India has 1000+ universities and 39,931 colleges offering diverse educational paths.

24/01/24, 9:50 am - +263 77 460 6508: It's amazing
24/01/24, 9:53 am - Gurvinder: So now Sinclaire, I hope you must have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead. As of now would you like to ask anything so far?
24/01/24, 9:54 am - +263 77 460 6508: No sir, I'm following
24/01/24, 9:56 am - Gurvinder: So now moving ahead by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India?
24/01/24, 9:59 am - +263 77 460 6508: No,I am to research on that
24/01/24, 10:01 am - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
24/01/24, 10:01 am - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
24/01/24, 10:01 am - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
24/01/24, 10:02 am - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
24/01/24, 10:02 am - Gurvinder: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*

*after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
24/01/24, 10:07 am - +263 77 460 6508: Following
24/01/24, 10:09 am - Gurvinder: So now shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?

24/01/24, 10:10 am - Gurvinder: Sinclaire, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.

24/01/24, 10:21 am - Gurvinder: The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

24/01/24, 10:22 am - Gurvinder: *2. Recruitment Partners: -*

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
24/01/24, 10:22 am - Gurvinder: *3. Webinars: -*

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -

24/01/24, 10:22 am - Gurvinder: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase. 

*What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
24/01/24, 10:32 am - +263 77 460 6508: Having an opportunity and insight on how things might turn out or tips on how to thrive and survive in the real world ,post-university stage is something  of paramount importance and would really benefit me ..alot
24/01/24, 10:45 am - Gurvinder: I am delighted to hear that Sinclaire, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
24/01/24, 10:47 am - +263 77 460 6508: Following
24/01/24, 10:56 am - Gurvinder: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

24/01/24, 10:57 am - Gurvinder: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
24/01/24, 11:05 am - +263 77 460 6508: Affirmative
24/01/24, 11:06 am - +263 77 460 6508: The program is interesting indeed
24/01/24, 11:58 am - Gurvinder: Alright Sinclaire, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
24/01/24, 12:00 pm - +263 77 460 6508: Correct
24/01/24, 12:04 pm - +263 77 460 6508: But we have limited resources  and a 50 -80% schoolarship would be greatly appreciated sir
24/01/24, 12:14 pm - Gurvinder: Noted.
24/01/24, 12:14 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so may I know if you have discussed international education plans with them in depth?
24/01/24, 12:17 pm - +263 77 460 6508: I have but the economic aspect has been the hindrance .But they are very much interested in the idea
24/01/24, 12:24 pm - Gurvinder: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
24/01/24, 12:25 pm - +263 77 460 6508: Yes sir
24/01/24, 12:33 pm - Gurvinder: Sinclaire as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
24/01/24, 12:36 pm - +263 77 460 6508: Over $2500
24/01/24, 12:37 pm - Gurvinder: Exactly Sinclaire, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
24/01/24, 12:37 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
24/01/24, 12:38 pm - +263 77 460 6508: Following
24/01/24, 12:40 pm - Gurvinder: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
24/01/24, 12:41 pm - +263 77 460 6508: True
24/01/24, 12:42 pm - Gurvinder: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
24/01/24, 12:42 pm - +263 77 460 6508: Ok
24/01/24, 12:42 pm - Gurvinder: Sinclaire basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
24/01/24, 12:42 pm - Gurvinder: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
24/01/24, 12:45 pm - +263 77 460 6508: Following
24/01/24, 12:45 pm - Gurvinder: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.

Are you familiar with the Edoofa Cycle?
24/01/24, 12:46 pm - +263 77 460 6508: Not really
24/01/24, 12:47 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
24/01/24, 12:47 pm - Gurvinder: Alright Sinclaire, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zimbabwe itself.
24/01/24, 12:48 pm - Gurvinder: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
24/01/24, 12:49 pm - +263 77 460 6508: Yes it's clear now
24/01/24, 12:52 pm - Gurvinder: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of the registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
24/01/24, 12:52 pm - Gurvinder: Basically, this registration fee will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August/September 2024 and the remaining in January next year 2025.
24/01/24, 12:52 pm - Gurvinder: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
24/01/24, 12:53 pm - Gurvinder: So now would you like to ask anything?
24/01/24, 12:55 pm - +263 77 460 6508: I understood
24/01/24, 12:55 pm - +263 77 460 6508: So basically we are still in the first phase
24/01/24, 12:56 pm - Gurvinder: Yes, that is correct.
24/01/24, 12:56 pm - +263 77 460 6508: Alright
24/01/24, 12:56 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check
24/01/24, 12:56 pm - Gurvinder: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
24/01/24, 12:56 pm - Gurvinder: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

6 .*Learn While You Earn Program*
 
This is a program that is designed in a way that help Edoofian students in further  decreasing their tuition fees after being found  eligible for the schoolarship program. It is proven to have help along of students as proof shows that some students have earned over 3000 worth of schoolarship credits.  The currency earned is not in the form of cash , salary or some sort but in schoolarship credits which only caters for the tuitions , according to my understanding. This program helps students to earn through  different  online programs eg writing of articles   and students with innovative minds are most likely to excel in this sector. It is noted that the EWYL program is only available to students in the Edoofas program . Most students have been able to get a slight picture of how the business  side works and even how to negotiate

25/01/24, 9:43 am - +971 55 245 0259: On point
25/01/24, 9:43 am - +263 77 248 3646: Morning
25/01/24, 9:44 am - Gurvinder: Thank you @263772483646 for addressing the same.

2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the *30th or 31st of January 2024*

02/02/24, 9:21 am - +971 55 245 0259: Give account..
02/02/24, 9:22 am - Gurvinder: The Bank Details that are to be used are the same @971552450259:

Swift code: AXISINBB207
IFSC code: UTIB0001147
Bank Name: Axis Bank Ltd.
Account Name: Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd.
Current Account Number: 917020070183626
Bank's Name:  Axis Bank Ltd.
Bank’s Address: Janakpuri, B Block, New Delhi[DL]
Ground Floor & Basement, B-1/503, Janakpuri, New Delhi 110058
02/02/24, 9:22 am - Gurvinder: You can complete the fee through online mode as well, if you wish shall I share that with you?
02/02/24, 10:49 am - +971 55 245 0259: OK noted sir
02/02/24, 1:24 pm - +971 55 245 0259: Helo sir am here in the bank they have told me they have approval process that may take upto 3 days
02/02/24, 1:25 pm - +971 55 245 0259: They have asked for a company invoice in my name etc
02/02/24, 1:26 pm - +971 55 245 0259: If difficult share alternative acct.. I think you mentioned they can pay in Zim Local is that right
02/02/24, 1:27 pm - Gurvinder: Yes, that is correct.
02/02/24, 1:27 pm - +971 55 245 0259: In Dubai they can transfer instantly INR into personal account.. Bit tricky stillbeacuse of difference in nationality
02/02/24, 1:28 pm - Gurvinder: So is there anyone in Zimbabwe who can pay locally?
02/02/24, 1:28 pm - +971 55 245 0259: Yes
02/02/24, 1:28 pm - +971 55 245 0259: Yes we can arrange that as quick as possible
02/02/24, 1:30 pm - Gurvinder: Basically you see in the first mode, the Direct Bank Transfer Mode, the transfer charges which are to be borne by the parents of the student ranges between $100 to $120 which become quite high for a lot of parents considering the economic situation in Zimbabwe itself. So as not every student is in a position to cater for an additional $100 to $120 just as transfer charge, the second mode was introduced, wherein, it is the Bank deposit in Mr. Charles's Account, in this the transfer charges get divided amongst 10 students resulting in an equivalent bearing of 12.5% at the end.

So as you can see in the letter that there is a Bank deposit in, Mr. Charles Jerera (Retired Education Officer)'s account as he is our Associated Partner there in Zimbabwe, Since 2020 there have been over 1400+ students who have been assisted by Mr Charles inorder to complete their enrollment formalities as well as university fee payments after arriving in India.
02/02/24, 1:30 pm - Gurvinder: Therefore the fee can also be paid through him. Since his account is a NOSTRO Account which only holds USD itself, therefore the necessary amount including the transfer charges in this mode itself would be $394 ($350 + $44 transfer charges), and the same details are as below:-

BANK NAME: FBC
