You can address me as Mr Gurvinder, we do have Mr Piiyush, Head of Counselling and  Mr Jyotishman, Head of Admissions who will be evaluating your responses for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
02/02/24, 11:29 am - +260 97 2880666: Thank you Mr Gurvinder
02/02/24, 12:36 pm - Gurvinder: Before we begin with the session, I would like to ask you, what prior understanding you have about the Edoofa Scholarship Program
02/02/24, 12:41 pm - +260 97 2880666: Well it gives students a chance to study abroad and have opportunities. Therefore EDOOFA guarantees that
02/02/24, 12:56 pm - Gurvinder: That is correct, let me brief you more.
02/02/24, 12:56 pm - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
02/02/24, 12:56 pm - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
02/02/24, 12:56 pm - Gurvinder: EDOOFA has commended the new government for its dedicated efforts and positive changes in the education sector, including the elimination of school fees, an increase in the number of teachers, and a focus on protecting vulnerable learners, particularly adolescent girls. *Edoofa is proud to support the government in its mission to transform the education sector and achieve sustainable development, aimed at ensuring quality education that is inclusive and equitable for all by 2030.*
02/02/24, 12:56 pm - Gurvinder: With the influx of students from Zimbabwe, we recorded more than 1500 students to the program in each of the last two years. Having a strong network and grasp of more than 100 schools with a panel of Headmasters, teachers, parents, and other educators, we now look to replicate our success in Zambia as well where we have already begun enrolling students since the last 6 months and we have closed 2023 intake with over 1500 students.
02/02/24, 12:56 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
02/02/24, 12:56 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
02/02/24, 12:56 pm - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
02/02/24, 12:57 pm - +260 97 2880666: Yes
02/02/24, 1:22 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so Likezo, as we start your counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
02/02/24, 1:29 pm - +260 97 2880666: I know I am capable of doing so  sir
02/02/24, 1:34 pm - Gurvinder: Now Likezo, I would like to know you better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about yourself, your career aspiration do include sharing about:-

1. Your highest education level?
2. The course you would like to study?
3. What do your parents do?
4. What is your parent’s highest education level?
5. Who has been supporting you for your Education so far?
6. Who will be supporting you financially for your higher education abroad?
7. Do you have any siblings? if yes, what do they do?
8. May I know which school do you study at and in which province is it located along with that how much was your per-term fee in Grade 12?

Please elaborate on your answers and answer them in points, so that I can understand your application more briefly and assist you in a better way

I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons that I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship. 

I hope to get a positive response from you soon.
06/02/24, 12:46 am - +260 97 2880666: Sorry for the late replys
06/02/24, 9:01 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning Likezo,
I would like you to come online and complete the counselling session today itself, or I will have to close your application due to you being not present for the session.
06/02/24, 9:03 am - +260 97 2880666: Yes we may begin
06/02/24, 10:05 am - Gurvinder: Please address this.
06/02/24, 10:29 am - +260 97 2880666: I see myself obtaining the required skills ,knowledge and understanding.  I also want to be noticed as a valuable worker because of my hard work. And EDOOFA comes in terms of recommending there members and it really helps people who are part of the program. This will benefit me because I get to do what I am interested in doing and I get a fair pay.
06/02/24, 10:55 am - Gurvinder: That is really great Likezo I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations,

However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

Are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way inorder to transform your career dear?
06/02/24, 10:57 am - +260 97 2880666: Yes I'm ready to do so
06/02/24, 11:57 am - Gurvinder: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
06/02/24, 1:14 pm - +260 97 2880666: Well it's not that I don't want to learn in my country but I feel like  experiencing a change of environment and adapting to the culture, the language and just the way of Learning and new places to explore .it would be great achievement to do it
06/02/24, 1:22 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
06/02/24, 1:29 pm - +260 97 2880666: Honestly speaking I wouldn't mind sharing my experience learning abroad with my country even suggesting a few tips to enhance on the education system and provide better quality of learning. Everyone deserves that different way of Learning so I think that's what I would do so that my country can develop in better
06/02/24, 1:33 pm - Gurvinder: I appreciate your sense of hardworking for your community Likezo, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?
06/02/24, 1:34 pm - +260 97 2880666: I do agree
06/02/24, 1:41 pm - Gurvinder: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
06/02/24, 1:42 pm - +260 97 2880666: Thank you for bringing it up I was wondering why India
06/02/24, 1:43 pm - Gurvinder: You see Edoofa’s vision to provide every student with an education that is not just affordable but accessible and employable as well can only be achieved by utilizing the infrastructure of Indian Education landscape that has been developed over the last 75+ years since India’s Independence.
06/02/24, 1:43 pm - Gurvinder: *Following are the reasons as to Why Edoofa Focuses on India for Scholarships: A Quick Look!*

06/02/24, 1:53 pm - +260 97 2880666: This is interesting
06/02/24, 1:54 pm - Gurvinder: So now Likezo, I hope you must have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead. As of now would you like to ask anything so far?
06/02/24, 1:57 pm - +260 97 2880666: For now I don't have any questions to ask
06/02/24, 1:58 pm - Gurvinder: So now moving ahead by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India?
06/02/24, 2:01 pm - +260 97 2880666: Um so far we know that without the scholarship it is very expensive
06/02/24, 2:02 pm - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
06/02/24, 2:02 pm - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
06/02/24, 2:02 pm - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
06/02/24, 2:02 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
06/02/24, 2:02 pm - Gurvinder: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*

*after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
06/02/24, 3:43 pm - +260 97 2880666: I see
06/02/24, 3:48 pm - Gurvinder: So now shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?
06/02/24, 4:37 pm - +260 97 2880666: Yes
06/02/24, 11:07 pm - Gurvinder: Well Dear, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you tomorrow again at 11AM CAT to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care.

Have a good day ahead. 
God Bless You!
