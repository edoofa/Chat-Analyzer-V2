12/01/24, 3:59 pm - Shubham Madhwal: So let me further elaborate to you on the Edoofa Scholarship Program
Edoofa Scholarship Program is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4500 students from different countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability is driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!
12/01/24, 3:59 pm - Shubham Madhwal: You know we have been helping students from the African nations and the SAARC countries for the past 6 years and in the short span of 6 years, the most common feedback which we hear from the students is how the Edoofa Program makes the higher education affordable through the financial aid and how it helps the students to make a financial plan to make sure that their dream of higher education abroad is fulfilled.

Basically, our motive is that by providing the SEELS (Students of Edoofa Earning and Learning to Success) initiative, we help our students in Planning and Giving them opportunities through which they can help themselves by self-sponsoring their higher education at the least annual Fee Possible.
12/01/24, 4:11 pm - Shubham Madhwal: I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I will connect with you *tomorrow again at 10 AM CAT* to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care.

In order to help me conduct a smooth counseling session, I would appreciate it if you are active for at least 2 hours between *7:30 AM-4:30 PM CAT*. In the meantime, I would like you to go through the video link of our student beneficiaries in India.

*“Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world.”*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
22/01/24, 8:01 am - +260 769578830: Good morning
22/01/24, 8:01 am - +260 769578830: Am ready
22/01/24, 9:20 am - Gurvinder: Benson let me explain to you that there are two kinds of programs that provide assistance to the students because a lot of times parents and students themselves misunderstand what a Scholarship actually means.

*1. Scholarships*
*2. Sponsorships*

Scholarships make education *affordable* for the students by reducing their *Tuition Fees*, now a lot of times parents and students consider that a Domestic Scholarship would be the same as an International Scholarship, but to understand the difference between them, consider yourself applying for an education in your own country with the help of a scholarship. Now after the scholarship when your tuition fee would be reduced, eventually your entire cost of education would be reduced because being a citizen of the country, you wouldn't be required to spend any fees on Accommodation and feeding separately since in that case, students would be staying with their families. However, if I personally plan to study in Zimbabwe with the same scholarship, I would have to incur some costs on Accommodation and Feeding because I am not a Zimbabwean Citizen. So a lot of times parents and students consider International Scholarship and Domestic Scholarship one and the same thing, but in reality, they aren't.

Sponsorships, on the other hand, take care entirely of a student's education, but because Sponsorships are provided by only a few organizations, there are a lot of terms and conditions which a student might need to follow in order to get the sponsorship, the most common term is that a student after completion of the course would have to work for the organization providing the sponsorship for a period of time.

22/01/24, 12:27 pm - +260 769578830: I read the edoofa FAQ document about payments that is the reason I asks about payments I was scared that disadvantaged children can't afford e.g providing there own transport to India and pay registration fee

Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
30/01/24, 9:29 am - Gurvinder: With the influx of students from Zimbabwe, we recorded more than 1500 students to the program in each of the last two years. Having a strong network and grasp of more than 100 schools with a panel of Headmasters, teachers, parents, and other educators, we now look to replicate our success in Malawi as well where we have already begun enrolling students since the last 6 months and we have closed 2023 intake with over 1500 students.

*Our strong relationships with educational institutions, such as Beautiful Gate, Kingdom Builders Academy, Kings Foundation, and Michiru Secondary School, are a testament to the success of the Edoofa Scholarship Program throughout Malawi.*

30/01/24, 2:54 pm - Gurvinder: That is really great @260769578830 I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations,

However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

Are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way inorder to transform your career dear?
30/01/24, 2:55 pm - +260 769578830: Am ready to do this and do what it takes
30/01/24, 3:03 pm - +260 769578830: Yes super ready
30/01/24, 3:04 pm - Gurvinder: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?

30/01/24, 3:09 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
30/01/24, 3:16 pm - +260 769578830: First of all I will secure my position in government, then since computer thinking should start wen u are young as possible so I will make sure In schools there is computer club were I can help them prepare for jets stuffs and robotics and project guidance

Don’t you agree?
30/01/24, 3:22 pm - +260 769578830: Totally
30/01/24, 3:23 pm - Gurvinder: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
30/01/24, 3:23 pm - +260 769578830: Yeah
30/01/24, 3:24 pm - Gurvinder: You see Edoofa’s vision to provide every student with an education that is not just affordable but accessible and employable as well can only be achieved by utilizing the infrastructure of Indian Education landscape that has been developed over the last 75+ years since India’s Independence.

30/01/24, 3:31 pm - +260 769578830: India is doing it
30/01/24, 3:32 pm - Gurvinder: So now @260769578830 , I hope you must have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead. As of now would you like to ask anything so far?
30/01/24, 3:32 pm - +260 769578830: No
30/01/24, 3:32 pm - Gurvinder: So now moving ahead by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India?
30/01/24, 3:33 pm - +260 769578830: No
30/01/24, 3:34 pm - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
30/01/24, 3:34 pm - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
30/01/24, 3:34 pm - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
30/01/24, 3:35 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
30/01/24, 3:35 pm - Gurvinder: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*

*after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
30/01/24, 3:38 pm - +260 769578830: Edoofa pays that remaining fees
30/01/24, 3:38 pm - Gurvinder: Yes, that is correct.
30/01/24, 3:39 pm - Gurvinder: So now shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?
30/01/24, 3:39 pm - +260 769578830: Yes
30/01/24, 3:43 pm - Gurvinder: @260769578830 , The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
30/01/24, 3:45 pm - +260 769578830: I like this
30/01/24, 3:46 pm - Gurvinder: The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

*1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-_*Africa Global Radio*_ - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

-_*Skooqs*_ - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
30/01/24, 3:46 pm - Gurvinder: *2. Recruitment Partners: -*

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
30/01/24, 3:46 pm - Gurvinder: *3. Webinars: -*

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
_Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world_ by *Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade*.
_How to network like a boss_ by *Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi*
_How to be industry ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer!_ by *Ms. Yasmin Bitugu*
_It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship_ by *Mr. Ronard Kachaje*

30/01/24, 3:46 pm - Gurvinder: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase. 

*What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
30/01/24, 3:49 pm - +260 769578830: Yes
30/01/24, 3:49 pm - Gurvinder: I am delighted to hear that @260769578830 , moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
30/01/24, 3:50 pm - +260 769578830: I see
30/01/24, 3:51 pm - Gurvinder: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

30/01/24, 3:51 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
30/01/24, 3:51 pm - Gurvinder: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
30/01/24, 3:53 pm - +260 769578830: Yes
30/01/24, 3:54 pm - Gurvinder: Alright @260769578830 , now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
30/01/24, 3:55 pm - +260 769578830: I didn't get
30/01/24, 3:58 pm - Gurvinder: Can you please elaborate? <This message was edited>
30/01/24, 3:58 pm - +260 769578830: This message
30/01/24, 3:59 pm - Gurvinder: Okay,@260769578830 , we've talked a lot about the money side of things for your education. I assume it's your family who will be helping you out with the costs. Is that right?
30/01/24, 4:00 pm - +260 769578830: This message was deleted
30/01/24, 4:01 pm - Gurvinder: May I know, why is that the case?
30/01/24, 4:02 pm - +260 769578830: I still didn't get what you meant
30/01/24, 4:02 pm - +260 769578830: So my parents will pay everything and costs
30/01/24, 4:05 pm - Gurvinder: Please as I have told you we bring the costs down to $2000-3000, and then you will be given a chance to bring that cost down by the EWYL program, I am asking will your parents will support you for the rest of the cost that remains?
30/01/24, 4:06 pm - +260 769578830: This message was deleted
30/01/24, 4:06 pm - +260 769578830: Like what
30/01/24, 4:07 pm - Gurvinder: May I know, are your parents willing to support you for the rest of the cost of education?
30/01/24, 4:07 pm - +260 769578830: Costs like if I may ask
31/01/24, 11:07 am - +260 769578830: Morning
31/01/24, 11:16 am - +260 769578830: Am ready to learn
31/01/24, 11:17 am - +260 769578830: About the costs my father can provide transport yes ,but his not sure about accommodation and keep up
31/01/24, 11:23 am - +260 769578830: Yes
01/02/24, 8:41 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

*“Strive not to be a success, but rather to be of value”*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
01/02/24, 9:10 am - +260 769578830: Am ready to cooperate
01/02/24, 9:27 am - Gurvinder: Please, didn't I inform you about the cost of Education in India after scholarship?
01/02/24, 9:28 am - +260 769578830: Yes
01/02/24, 9:28 am - Gurvinder: So may I know, what it is then?
01/02/24, 9:29 am - +260 769578830: It's fine
01/02/24, 10:09 am - Gurvinder: Please answer what are the figures.
01/02/24, 11:17 am - +260 769578830: Elaborate more here
01/02/24, 12:01 pm - Gurvinder: As I have told you here, all these costs are covered in the above given range of cost of education.
01/02/24, 12:27 pm - +260 769578830: Okay I get yes
01/02/24, 12:28 pm - Gurvinder: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
01/02/24, 12:30 pm - +260 769578830: Yes
01/02/24, 12:30 pm - Gurvinder: @260769578830 as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
01/02/24, 12:34 pm - +260 769578830: $1,500-2,250
01/02/24, 12:35 pm - Gurvinder: Exactly @260769578830 , and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
01/02/24, 12:35 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
01/02/24, 12:38 pm - +260 769578830: So u will pay my admission fees
01/02/24, 12:40 pm - Gurvinder: Please, this is not the admission fees, this is an enrollment fees, Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
01/02/24, 12:41 pm - +260 769578830: Yeah
01/02/24, 12:46 pm - Gurvinder: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
01/02/24, 12:46 pm - Gurvinder: Basically, there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee, before their Grade 12 result is out).


Phase 3: Once the final grade 12 results are out, if the student would have passed the necessary requirement (of 4 Grade 12 passes.) then start with their University Interaction. If the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents.


The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.

However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
01/02/24, 1:18 pm - +260 769578830: Okay according to my results are they cool
01/02/24, 1:19 pm - Gurvinder: Yes, they are, Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.

Are you familiar with the Edoofa Cycle?
01/02/24, 1:20 pm - +260 769578830: This message was deleted
01/02/24, 1:20 pm - +260 769578830: This message was deleted
01/02/24, 1:26 pm - +260 769578830: Yes
01/02/24, 1:26 pm - +260 769578830: Tell me all of it
01/02/24, 1:27 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
01/02/24, 1:27 pm - Gurvinder: Alright @260769578830 , so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zambia itself.
01/02/24, 1:27 pm - Gurvinder: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
01/02/24, 1:30 pm - +260 769578830: Yes
01/02/24, 1:30 pm - Gurvinder: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of the registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
01/02/24, 1:30 pm - Gurvinder: Basically, this registration fee will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August/September 2024 and the remaining in January next year 2025.
01/02/24, 1:30 pm - Gurvinder: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
01/02/24, 1:30 pm - Gurvinder: So now would you like to ask anything?
01/02/24, 1:31 pm - +260 769578830: No
01/02/24, 1:32 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check
01/02/24, 1:32 pm - Gurvinder: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
01/02/24, 1:32 pm - Gurvinder: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.
