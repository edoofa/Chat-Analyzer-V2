10/01/24, 10:38 am - +263 71 572 9765: I haven't learnt anything about Tatenda's journey and experience with the Edoofa Program yet but according to what he shared with us Edoofa schoolarship program believes in quality education and also it believes that everyone should get a chance to a quality educational experience 
The Edoofa Program is based with work- study models , This program also offers or helps in solving the problem of lack of affordable hight education and also employment
10/01/24, 10:43 am - +263 71 572 9765: The Edoofa Program also stays with students throughout their academic process as their mentor and a caretaker , this program help the students from building applications , applying to college and also training them
10/01/24, 10:53 am - +263 71 572 9765: The program is well-appreciated in African Continents as it offers 50-100% tuition fees and this program has helped over 3000 students  from different countries with affordable , accessible education and also employible driven
10/01/24, 11:31 am - Gurvinder: Noted, let me brief you more.
10/01/24, 11:31 am - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
10/01/24, 11:31 am - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
10/01/24, 11:31 am - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
10/01/24, 11:32 am - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
10/01/24, 11:49 am - +263 71 572 9765: Yes that right sir
10/01/24, 11:50 am - +263 71 572 9765: Thank you for explaining further it's more clearer now
10/01/24, 11:50 am - +263 71 572 9765: Excuse me Mr Gurvinder l might have some questions to ask you so that l understand better
10/01/24, 12:07 pm - Gurvinder: Please share your concerns?
10/01/24, 3:14 pm - +263 71 572 9765: Can you in lighten on how your system works in term of the schoolarship
10/01/24, 3:51 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so Tinotenda, as we start your counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
10/01/24, 9:17 pm - Gurvinder: Well Dear, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you tomorrow again at 10AM CAT to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care.

Have a good day ahead. 
God Bless You!
10/01/24, 9:50 pm - +263 71 572 9765: Thank you so much sir
11/01/24, 8:47 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

13/01/24, 9:59 am - +263 71 572 9765: Why I choose Marketing:
I believe its a theory of human motivation that can be used to develop new products, focus promotional strategies, segment markets, and overall communicate better with consumers while creating an environment conducive for brand engagement to take place.
However studying Marketing gives a unique competitive advantage for me: 
i.e You can learn how to promote yourself and your work. After all, marketing helps in understand the true meaning of value: The value of the product and the value of the person or brand that delivers said product.
13/01/24, 10:17 am - Gurvinder: Tinotenda, your insights into marketing are insightful and demonstrate a clear understanding of the field's significance. Recognizing marketing as a tool for understanding human motivation, developing products, and creating effective communication strategies is a key aspect of success in this field.
13/01/24, 10:17 am - Gurvinder: So if I may ask from your family or known circle has anyone pursued a career in this field?
13/01/24, 12:13 pm - +263 71 572 9765: Noone in my family has pursued in this field nor my known circle Sir

15/01/24, 10:53 am - Gurvinder: After understanding your interests and motivation toward the Subject
According to my expertise, the following course will cater to all your likings and will help you achieve your future goals:

*Bachelor of Commerce (B.com)*
15/01/24, 12:17 pm - +263 71 572 9765: Can you please explain further about this course
15/01/24, 12:47 pm - Gurvinder: Yes I will, but first I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.
15/01/24, 12:47 pm - Gurvinder: Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.
15/01/24, 1:20 pm - +263 77 230 2349: Ok we understand but whats the way forward
15/01/24, 1:20 pm - +263 77 230 2349: So now what are the requirement
15/01/24, 1:27 pm - Gurvinder: So shall I brief you about the course?
15/01/24, 1:43 pm - +263 77 230 2349: Yes sir thank
15/01/24, 1:49 pm - Gurvinder: *Bachelor of Commerce (B.com)* is a three year long undergraduate course that is evenly distributed into 6 half-yearly semesters.

15/01/24, 2:28 pm - Gurvinder: Since you have understood the course properly can you now tell me in 150 to 200 words that if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself 5 years after the completion of this course and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
15/01/24, 6:32 pm - +263 71 572 9765: A Bachelor of Commerce degree opens up a vast array of career opportunities across multiple industries, such as accounting, finance, marketing, and management. It will provide me with a wide range of business skills to have a strong understanding and appreciation of business. By studying different aspects of business, I will be able to work more seamlessly with other professionals in the future, equipping me with the knowledge and skills needed to excel in various roles, and making them marketable to employers. 
So I Tinotenda Bamba. As I hold a Degree in bachelor of commerce, 5 years later do see myself as a community builder. Yes, I do have benefits of my interest but also do not forget my community. The reason is that commerce plays a significant role in the day-to-day running of businesses and, the development of nations and their citizens by simply facilitating trade between nations or within the nation so this allows me to study harder on the degree for my loved ones and me, I thank you. And can be possible if l am accepted with the Edoofa Program
15/01/24, 6:32 pm - +263 71 572 9765: I'm sorry for the late response it was due to some network challenges

16/01/24, 9:27 am - Gurvinder: That is really great Tinotenda I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations,

However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

Are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way inorder to transform your career dear?
16/01/24, 9:46 am - +263 77 416 8524: Good morning
16/01/24, 9:48 am - +263 77 416 8524: She is generally a hardworking girl and knows how to push towards her goals nevertheless she will be able to answer for herself in a few
16/01/24, 10:01 am - Gurvinder: I am glad that She is willing to work hard for her career, however, can you please tell me why you want her to study abroad and not in your country?
16/01/24, 10:48 am - +263 77 416 8524: - Universities are very expensive here 
- she stands to gain quite a great deal of exposure outside of the country
16/01/24, 10:50 am - +263 77 230 2349: Name: ‎Tino Buddie‎
Phone1: ‎‎0782559997‎‎
Phone2: ‎‎0782559997‎‎
16/01/24, 10:52 am - +263 77 230 2349: Sorry sir can you add this number due to our netwk the other line for Tinotenda is facing challanges on netwk bear with my angel sooo in order to have good communication with you decided to get another line which doesnt have netwk problem
16/01/24, 11:04 am - +263 71 572 9765: Yes l am willing  to do what ever it takes to achieve  my goal
16/01/24, 11:42 am - +263 77 230 2349: As I can say Tinotenda is a hard working and ihave faith that she can have a hard push and put more effort on this progran and im looking forward to the institution to inroll my Angel to pursue her accademic studies 


She is a hard working girl
16/01/24, 12:31 pm - Gurvinder: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
16/01/24, 12:41 pm - +263 71 572 9765: Currently  with the economy  in our country  it is very expensive  to study in my county  
Also studying  abroad  will open new opportunities  for me in terms of employment  because  according  to my research  students that obtained  their degrees  abroad have a huge opportunity  to find employment  in our country  
Last but not least the reason  why l want to study  abroad  is because  l want experience  and exposure
16/01/24, 12:58 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
16/01/24, 2:16 pm - +263 71 572 9765: If that happens  then l will  try to share my experience  with my pears
16/01/24, 2:19 pm - Gurvinder: I appreciate your sense of hardworking for your community Tinotenda, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?
16/01/24, 2:20 pm - +263 71 572 9765: Yes l will  be able
16/01/24, 2:23 pm - Gurvinder: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
16/01/24, 2:24 pm - +263 71 572 9765: Yes l wanted to ask that question  stating  why India  from all the countries
16/01/24, 2:27 pm - Gurvinder: You see Edoofa’s vision to provide every student with an education that is not just affordable but accessible and employable as well can only be achieved by utilizing the infrastructure of Indian Education landscape that has been developed over the last 75+ years since India’s Independence.
16/01/24, 2:27 pm - Gurvinder: *Following are the reasons as to Why Edoofa Focuses on India for Scholarships: A Quick Look!*

16/01/24, 2:32 pm - +263 71 572 9765: But if l may ask so its only  India or you offer scholarships  in India only  to be specific
16/01/24, 2:35 pm - +263 77 416 8524: Great
16/01/24, 2:44 pm - Gurvinder: So now Tinotenda, I hope you must have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead. As of now would you like to ask anything so far?
16/01/24, 2:52 pm - +263 77 230 2349: Great and thank you
16/01/24, 5:35 pm - +263 71 572 9765: For now l don't  have any questions
16/01/24, 10:47 pm - Gurvinder: Well Dear, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you tomorrow again at 10AM CAT to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care.

Have a good day ahead. 
God Bless You!
17/01/24, 8:28 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

*“There are no secrets to success. It is the result of preparation, hard work, and learning from failure."*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
17/01/24, 9:10 am - +263 71 572 9765: Good  morning  to you to sir
17/01/24, 9:21 am - +263 77 230 2349: Good mng sir
17/01/24, 9:24 am - +263 77 416 8524: Good morning
17/01/24, 9:44 am - Gurvinder: So now moving ahead by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India?
17/01/24, 10:46 am - +263 71 572 9765: No im not
17/01/24, 10:48 am - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
17/01/24, 10:48 am - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
17/01/24, 10:48 am - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
17/01/24, 10:48 am - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
17/01/24, 10:48 am - Gurvinder: In simple words Tinotenda what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well. 

However as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her counselling, eligibility check stage and is thorough throughout the evaluation, then they surely are rewarded with higher quantum of scholarship after which the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, now this , and even *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
17/01/24, 11:52 am - +263 71 572 9765: About the process of learning  and at the same time earning  how does it work can you explain  further  please
17/01/24, 12:34 pm - Gurvinder: Tinotenda, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
17/01/24, 12:39 pm - +263 77 230 2349: Great
17/01/24, 12:51 pm - Gurvinder: The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

*1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-_*Africa Global Radio*_ - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0

-_*Skooqs*_ - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
17/01/24, 12:51 pm - Gurvinder: *2. Recruitment Partners: -*

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
17/01/24, 12:51 pm - Gurvinder: *3. Webinars: -*

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
_Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world_ by *Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade*.
_How to network like a boss_ by *Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi*
_How to be industry ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer!_ by *Ms. Yasmin Bitugu*
_It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship_ by *Mr. Ronard Kachaje*

17/01/24, 12:52 pm - Gurvinder: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase. 

*What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
17/01/24, 12:55 pm - +263 71 572 9765: So sir its more like going  to school  and going  to work at the same time right
17/01/24, 12:59 pm - Gurvinder: Yes, somewhat that is correct.
17/01/24, 12:59 pm - Gurvinder: Please address this.
17/01/24, 1:00 pm - +263 71 572 9765: Yes l think it will  benefit because  l will be taught  on how l create opportunities  for my self and also there is a big possibility  of getting  employment  after completing my studies <This message was edited>
17/01/24, 1:37 pm - Gurvinder: I am delighted to hear that Tinotenda, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
17/01/24, 1:39 pm - +263 71 572 9765: Ok l understand
17/01/24, 2:13 pm - Gurvinder: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

17/01/24, 2:13 pm - Gurvinder: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
17/01/24, 4:11 pm - +263 71 572 9765: Yes l can see more clearly  and also l understand  it  thank  you
17/01/24, 9:50 pm - Gurvinder: Well Dear, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you tomorrow again at 10AM CAT to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care.

Have a good day ahead. 
God Bless You!
18/01/24, 8:40 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

*“The best way to predict your future is to create it."*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference
18/01/24, 9:14 am - +263 71 572 9765: Good morning
18/01/24, 9:14 am - +263 77 230 2349: Mng sir
18/01/24, 10:19 am - Gurvinder: Alright Tinotenda, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
18/01/24, 10:23 am - +263 77 230 2349: Yes will support Tinotenda becouse we need the girl to archieve her goals and with you I know she will succed well
18/01/24, 10:52 am - +263 77 416 8524: Good morning 
Yes we will be supporting her in all aspects <This message was edited>
18/01/24, 12:24 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so may I know if you have discussed international education plans with them in depth?
18/01/24, 12:26 pm - +263 71 572 9765: No l haven't
18/01/24, 12:55 pm - Gurvinder: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
18/01/24, 12:57 pm - +263 71 572 9765: Yes l am
18/01/24, 1:12 pm - Gurvinder: Tinotenda as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
18/01/24, 1:15 pm - +263 71 572 9765: The student will probably  spend 1500 -3000
18/01/24, 1:37 pm - Gurvinder: Exactly Tinotenda, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
18/01/24, 1:37 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
18/01/24, 1:39 pm - +263 71 572 9765: For one university  or ???
18/01/24, 1:41 pm - +263 71 572 9765: Yeah its true it has affected  so many things but will it be for all of the universities  or just one
18/01/24, 1:52 pm - Gurvinder: Please that would be for all.
18/01/24, 1:55 pm - +263 71 572 9765: Ok i understand
18/01/24, 2:23 pm - Gurvinder: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
18/01/24, 2:23 pm - Gurvinder: Tinotenda basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
18/01/24, 2:23 pm - Gurvinder: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
18/01/24, 2:27 pm - +263 71 572 9765: So before going  to phase 2  the amount  of $350 should  paid first  ??
18/01/24, 2:43 pm - Gurvinder: No, you only have to pay, if you are found eligible.
18/01/24, 2:43 pm - Gurvinder: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.

Are you familiar with the Edoofa Cycle?
18/01/24, 2:44 pm - +263 71 572 9765: Ok
18/01/24, 2:44 pm - +263 71 572 9765: No l am not
18/01/24, 3:26 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
18/01/24, 3:26 pm - Gurvinder: Alright Tinotenda, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zimbabwe itself. <This message was edited>
18/01/24, 3:26 pm - Gurvinder: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?

19/01/24, 9:28 am - +263 71 572 9765: Good morning
19/01/24, 10:48 am - Gurvinder: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of the registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
19/01/24, 10:48 am - Gurvinder: Basically, this registration fee will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August/September 2024 and the remaining in January next year 2025.
19/01/24, 10:48 am - Gurvinder: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*

As we all know the world  we all leaving  in right now is not in good condition  so according  to my research  there  are programs  that offers  scholarships  to students  by those same programs  will end up scheming the students or they will  just help them with a short period  of time and they just disappear  what make Edoofa program different  from those other programs whats the guarantee
19/01/24, 11:55 am - +263 77 230 2349: Afternoon sir
19/01/24, 1:46 pm - Gurvinder: Tinotenda, the difference between everyone and us is that, unlike everyone, we stay with our students on their whole educational journey justifying our motto of accessible, affordable and employable education.
19/01/24, 2:09 pm - Gurvinder: I believe you have had a negative experience because of which it is absolutely fine that you feel this way,

If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning. Therefore I would like you to be online at the above-mentioned time for a smooth conversation.

I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons that I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship. 

I hope to get a positive response from you soon.
