I would like to know you better as a student so please go ahead, tell me a bit about yourself, your education, what course you would like to study, how much was your  every term fee, along with what do you wish to study, your strengths and weaknesses, and your hobbies, since I honestly don't know a lot about you?

And with that a detailed description of your family background, what do your parents do (Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work)?, what is their highest education level along with if you have any siblings, please?
06/02/24, 1:28 pm - +263 71 847 4679: Im Blessing Patsika, born on 1 May 2005, this you know.I'm the Headboy at Speciss College, Highfield Harare. I'm an Upper 6 student doing MPC(Pure mathematics, physics and chemistry), hoping to do civil engineering. 
My school fee is $300 per term. 
Along with what I want to study, my strength concerning my attitude is that if I start something, I'm determined to finish. Usually l don't give up on something, unless the bridge isn't firm, it's better to fail rather than quiting and also my weakness is that if l quite something, I'll never attempt to try it again. And then Academically, l love physics more than Chemistry though at first it was a little bit difficult. I'm good in mathematics.

I like singing very much, infact I'm a song writer (gospel songs cause lm a Christian). I'm also musician l can play a keyboard, drums and guiter. But I'm based in playing lead guiter

I'm from a family of 3.I live with both of my parent, my dad being a driver at a construction company (Rosam Builders) and my mom a is self employed person. She has a small tuck shop having brains and some cosmetics.
Both my parents have no any educational qualifications. My dad left school around the age of 12 because of the death of parents. My mother aslo left school at grade seven because of the death of her father. They lived a tough life. 
I've a brother after me in form 4, turning 17 on 6 Oct and the last born is a girl turning 6 on 22 March. My mother is pregnant so very soon we'll four.
