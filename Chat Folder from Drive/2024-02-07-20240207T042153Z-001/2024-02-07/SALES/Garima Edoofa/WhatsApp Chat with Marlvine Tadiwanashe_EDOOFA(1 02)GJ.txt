03/02/24, 11:43 am - Garima Edoofa: May I know if you understood everything properly?
03/02/24, 11:47 am - +27 84 893 9633: Yes how different people have become successful through being skillfully equipped
03/02/24, 11:48 am - +27 84 893 9633: Yes indeed sir
03/02/24, 11:50 am - Garima Edoofa: That is remarkable. I see that you understand the quality of higher education that Edoofa seeks to deliver to its students so that after completing their education, the students is capable of achieving their career goals and having a prosperous career ahead of them.

Okay, so are you or any of your family members aware of the expense of a comparable quality higher education for an international student without a scholarship in India?
03/02/24, 11:52 am - +27 84 893 9633: Precisely we are not aware
03/02/24, 11:54 am - Garima Edoofa: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is *around 6000-8000 USD. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from USD 15000 to USD 35000. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 6-year degree ranging from USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000*.

Now as we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with over 250+ Universities for the last 14 + years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 5 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
03/02/24, 11:54 am - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
03/02/24, 11:54 am - Garima Edoofa: So, don't you think it is affordable for your family?
03/02/24, 11:58 am - +27 84 893 9633: Yes
03/02/24, 11:59 am - Garima Edoofa: However as per my experience, I can share with you that *if you are able to perform and clear all these criteria with a high passing grade, you would be eligible for higher quantum of Scholarship*, in which you will just have to pay a minimal fee of *$1200-$1800*, Which would cover your entire fees be it food, accommodation, Tuition etc.

What are your thoughts on the same?
03/02/24, 12:00 pm - Garima Edoofa: In simple words Marlvine, what we do is, reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
03/02/24, 12:01 pm - +27 84 893 9633: Fantastic sir
03/02/24, 12:03 pm - Garima Edoofa: Shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program?
03/02/24, 12:03 pm - +27 84 893 9633: Yes sir go ahead
03/02/24, 12:44 pm - Garima Edoofa: The Earn While You Learn Program or the *EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program*. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
03/02/24, 12:44 pm - Garima Edoofa: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.


1. *Projects with Brands and Companies*: -

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0

-Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
03/02/24, 12:44 pm - Garima Edoofa: 2. *Recruitment Partners*: -

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
03/02/24, 12:45 pm - Garima Edoofa: 3. *Webinars*: -

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi
How to be industry ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu
It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje
Decoding the science of personal branding by Mr, Simon Maingi
03/02/24, 12:45 pm - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
03/02/24, 12:45 pm - Garima Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases. 

What are your views on the same? Do you think this will be benefiting you?
03/02/24, 12:46 pm - +263 78 819 1268: I want to study abroad so that i get to know more and explore alot
03/02/24, 12:49 pm - +263 78 819 1268: There are many reasons why swhy i want to study abroad! One reason is that it can be a great way to immerse myself in a new culture and gain a new perspective on the world. It can also be a great way to meet new people and make friends from all over the world. And it can be a great way to improve my language skills, if i am studying in a country where a different language is spoken. Not to mention, it's an opportunity to travel and see new places😁
03/02/24, 1:01 pm - +263 78 819 1268: One of the biggest benefits of studying abroad is the opportunity to gain a global perspective.I will be exposed to new ideas, customs, and ways of thinking that you might not have encountered at home. This can help me become more culturally aware and open-minded. It can also help me build skills like adaptability, independence, and confidence. In addition, studying abroad can boost my employability and give you a competitive edge in the job market. And it can help me build my resume and stand out from other applicants. 😄
03/02/24, 1:04 pm - Garima Edoofa: I genuinely value all the responses you have provided, and your evident enthusiasm for diligent work is truly commendable.
03/02/24, 1:05 pm - Garima Edoofa: Can you please answer this question?
03/02/24, 1:27 pm - +27 84 893 9633: That's wonderful the students are producing evident results which will impact their personalities and their future is certain
03/02/24, 1:27 pm - +27 84 893 9633: Great program indeed
03/02/24, 1:39 pm - Garima Edoofa: That is great to know, so now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food, and accommodation*, which means for the monthly family cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
03/02/24, 1:39 pm - Garima Edoofa: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

03/02/24, 1:46 pm - +263 78 819 1268: Wow, those are really interesting insights. I can definitely see how having a global perspective and a strong sense of adaptability can be beneficial in the job market. And it's great to hear that Edoofians are gaining these skills through their international education. I think it's definitely an advantage to have this kind of experience on my resume. And it sounds like it's not just about the professional benefits, but also the personal growth and development that comes with studying abroad. I'm really interested 😊
03/02/24, 1:51 pm - +263 78 819 1268: Well, it sounds like the webinars are really insightful and helpful. I think the opportunity to turn my situation personally  into an opportunity to excel is a really valuable skill, both personally and professionally. It's great to hear that Edoofa is focusing on this kind of skill development. And I think it's definitely beneficial for students like me (Marlvine as an example) to feel like i am being prepared for the future, both in terms of their career and their personal development and to finish up i know i will benefit thank you Sir Garima Jain😊
03/02/24, 1:59 pm - Garima Edoofa: I am Ms. Garima, please.
03/02/24, 2:01 pm - Garima Edoofa: Certainly, I appreciate your expressed interest in studying abroad. Your articulated reasons, such as immersing yourself in a new culture for a broader perspective, fostering international friendships, and enhancing language proficiency, are well-noted. Additionally, the prospect of exploring new places through this educational endeavor is indeed an enticing opportunity.
03/02/24, 2:01 pm - Garima Edoofa: Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :

1.*Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*​: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses,which is completely waived off.
 
2.*Employability through practical training*​: We believe Students shouldn't just learn in theory, they should gain real-world experience instead of academic theory. That is why we help them by designing a practical employment oriented curriculum that helps students pick up job skills needed to be employable.
 
 
3.*Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing and involving. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What’s more, students earn scholarship credits in the process, thereby further reducing the burden of the cost of their education.
 
 
4.*Higher Education Concierge*​: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.
03/02/24, 2:02 pm - Garima Edoofa: So, after looking over the facts that distinguish Edoofa, which of the four points did you appreciate the most?
03/02/24, 2:11 pm - +263 78 819 1268: Ooohhh sory 😅
03/02/24, 2:11 pm - +263 78 819 1268: Yes it is indeed thank youu
03/02/24, 2:16 pm - +263 78 819 1268: This system encourages saving therefore it is something great
The 2 fact is great Ms Garima
03/02/24, 2:18 pm - Garima Edoofa: I am delighted to know that you have been looking for the same.


Alright Marlvine, basically, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
03/02/24, 2:26 pm - +263 77 976 1576: Yes we are fully behind him
03/02/24, 2:32 pm - Garima Edoofa: Alright @263788191268 @263779761576 @27848939633 , basically once we complete your counseling session I would give you time to properly discuss about your entire application once again with your family members so that they too could have much better clarity regarding the same. Meanwhile, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
03/02/24, 2:43 pm - +263 77 976 1576: Yes
03/02/24, 2:48 pm - Garima Edoofa: @263779761576 as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
03/02/24, 2:49 pm - +263 77 976 1576: The student end up spending more
03/02/24, 2:50 pm - Garima Edoofa: Can you please answer the question specifically?
03/02/24, 2:52 pm - +263 77 976 1576: He or she end up spending 1.500-2000
03/02/24, 2:53 pm - Garima Edoofa: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
03/02/24, 2:53 pm - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
03/02/24, 2:53 pm - Garima Edoofa: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
03/02/24, 2:53 pm - Garima Edoofa: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education.

Don’t you think so?
03/02/24, 2:54 pm - +263 77 976 1576: Yes I also think so
03/02/24, 2:55 pm - Garima Edoofa: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
03/02/24, 2:55 pm - Garima Edoofa: @263779761576 basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
03/02/24, 2:55 pm - Garima Edoofa: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
03/02/24, 2:56 pm - +263 78 819 1268: Yes exactly
03/02/24, 2:57 pm - +263 77 976 1576: Ok
03/02/24, 2:57 pm - +263 78 819 1268: Yes i am
03/02/24, 2:58 pm - Garima Edoofa: @263779761576 @263788191268 , as we have discussed about the payment policy of the Enrollment fee and other finances of the program as well, so can you share with me what all did you understand about the financial aspect of the program and how Edoofa helps a student arrange and pay his finances all by himself (in 80 to 100 words)?
03/02/24, 3:02 pm - +263 78 819 1268: Well, from what I understand, Edoofa has a very clear and transparent payment policy. They have a payment calculator on their website that allows students to calculate the total cost of their program and the payment plan that works best for them. They also offer scholarships, so students can receive financial assistance based on their financial need. Additionally, Edoofa has a team of advisors who can help students with their finances and create a payment plan that is realistic and achievable. So, overall, I think Edoofa's payment policy is very clear and fair, and it helps students manage their finances in a way that is realistic and affordable
03/02/24, 3:04 pm - Garima Edoofa: Let me summarize the financial aspects for you
*Enrollment fee*
The enrollment fee is $350 out of which you need to pay only $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 is to be paid in next 30 days 
 
For all the services and assistance including Applications,SOP,Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection, and sessions etc all you need to pay is $350
 
 
*Cost of education*
The cost of education is reduced from $6000-$8000 to $2000-$3000 per annum which includes Tuition fee,Accommodation,Food,Wifi,Laundry,Library,Gym fee etc!
 
This cost can be further reduced through the earnings from Earn While You Learn program.
03/02/24, 3:05 pm - Garima Edoofa: I hope now it is clear @263788191268 @263779761576 ?
03/02/24, 3:05 pm - +263 78 819 1268: Oky well understood
03/02/24, 3:06 pm - +263 78 819 1268: Yes it is
03/02/24, 3:06 pm - +263 77 976 1576: Yes it's clear
03/02/24, 3:07 pm - Garima Edoofa: Yes, and I hope that you have understood how it totally depends upon the student to make his/her higher education affordable with the help of the Earn While You Learn Program's Scholarship Credits?
03/02/24, 3:08 pm - +263 78 819 1268: Yes well understood
03/02/24, 3:10 pm - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
03/02/24, 3:10 pm - Garima Edoofa: Let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
03/02/24, 3:10 pm - Garima Edoofa: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zimbabwe itself.
03/02/24, 3:11 pm - Garima Edoofa: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
03/02/24, 3:12 pm - +263 78 819 1268: Yes

particular University chosen by you.

The first part will be paid in Coming few months of (2024-2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).

03/02/24, 3:13 pm - Garima Edoofa: So now would you like to ask anything?

03/02/24, 3:31 pm - Garima Edoofa: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
03/02/24, 3:31 pm - Garima Edoofa: Mrs.Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)

03/02/24, 3:32 pm - Garima Edoofa: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
03/02/24, 3:32 pm - Garima Edoofa: And for any questions apart from whatever we have explained, I would appreciate it if you refer your family to the FAQ document which has all the answers to most of the queries which generally parents have.
03/02/24, 3:32 pm - Garima Edoofa: Also, have a look at some pictures of the students who came to India recently for their Academic Session.

Your scholarship journey is reaching a crucial juncture. *Monday on “05-02-24” at 10:00 AM CAT,* I will meticulously evaluate your application. This session is not just about answering your questions; it includes a vital Eligibility Check Interview.

We strongly recommend parents/guardians join, recognizing that higher education is a family decision. Prepare for a series of interviews, marking a significant phase in finalizing your scholarship application. As your counselor, I wish you the very best. It's been a pleasure guiding you through your career sessions.

If you qualify for the interview, *Senior Career Counselor Mr Sahil would be getting in touch*, we look forward to welcoming you to India. Please be proactive, as everyone's time is valuable. The Senior Counselor and Director will make decisions based on your interview and adhere strictly to the given time. Follow instructions diligently, and if the session is completed within the allotted time, your application will proceed.

Happy Family Discussion!
Stay Blessed!

I would like to ask you a few questions, but before that with immense pleasure, I would like to share the glimpses of the Africa Visit of our Founders which took place in June 2023! 

It was a much-awaited event and they were welcomed by Ministries, Educationalists, Edoofians, and Parents across different African Countries. This is a must-watch video depicting the Acceptance of the Program in the African Continent, especially in Zimbabwe!
05/02/24, 11:16 am - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
05/02/24, 11:17 am - Garima Edoofa: In the mean time can you please answer these questions.
05/02/24, 11:17 am - Garima Edoofa: Can you tell me:-

1. What is the name of the course which you would be studying through the Edoofa Program?

2. What is the country finalized for your higher education?

3. What is the average cost for studies in India without a scholarship?

4. What is the annual fee you will pay if found eligible for the program?

5. What is the enrollment fee of the Edoofa Program? 

6. If you are found eligible for the program in how many days you will have to pay the first part of your enrollment fee?

7. After receiving your offer letter from the University, you will have to pay your registration fee to finalize your university selection and reserve your scholarship seat in a particular university, this registration fee would be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?
05/02/24, 11:18 am - +263 78 819 1268: Wow that is nice
05/02/24, 11:19 am - Garima Edoofa: Can you please answer this question?
05/02/24, 11:20 am - +263 78 819 1268: Oky Ms Garima
05/02/24, 11:21 am - +263 78 819 1268: Wow, that's a lot of great questions! Let's take them one at a time.

1. The course that i would be studying through the Edoofa program depends on your interests and academic background. There are a variety of courses available, such as business, computer science, engineering, and more but I would like to study Supply chain management 

2. The country for your higher education is also dependent on your interests and academic background. There are a variety of countries available through the Edoofa program, such as the USA, UK, Canada, Germany, and more but i am going to study in India 🇮🇳
05/02/24, 11:24 am - Garima Edoofa: @263788191268 , you have to answer these questions as per your application. For eg, which course has been finalized for you?
05/02/24, 11:25 am - +263 78 819 1268: Oooohh there is Business administration so far
05/02/24, 11:25 am - +263 78 819 1268: Let me continue to answer these questions Ms Garima
05/02/24, 11:27 am - +263 78 819 1268: I'm glad you mentioned scholarships! If you are eligible for a scholarship through the Edoofa program, your annual fees will be significantly reduced. The exact amount of your scholarship will depend on your academic qualifications and the specific university you choose
05/02/24, 11:28 am - +263 78 819 1268: 4. If you are found eligible for the Edoofa program, the enrollment fee is usually around $500. This is a one-time fee that covers the cost of your application, processing, and support from the Edoofa team. It also helps to ensure that your scholarship is secured and that you are matched with the best possible university.
05/02/24, 11:29 am - +263 78 819 1268: 5. After receiving your offer letter from the university, you will have to pay your registration fee within 10 days to finalize your place at the university and to secure your scholarship. This registration fee is also the first part of your first year's annual fee after your scholarship, so it will be deducted from the total cost of your tuition

05/02/24, 12:28 pm - Garima Edoofa: Are your parents ready for the same?
05/02/24, 12:29 pm - +263 78 819 1268: How did i do so far

05/02/24, 12:35 pm - +263 78 819 1268: Like sending a voice note answering those questions or what ??

05/02/24, 12:38 pm - +27 84 893 9633: <Media omitted>
05/02/24, 12:38 pm - +263 78 819 1268: Oky well understood
05/02/24, 12:47 pm - Garima Edoofa: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
05/02/24, 12:47 pm - Garima Edoofa: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
05/02/24, 12:47 pm - Garima Edoofa: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.
05/02/24, 12:47 pm - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
05/02/24, 12:49 pm - Garima Edoofa: Ideally as you know, the tentative dates:
1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 12th or 13th February 2024 for $200 and the 12th or 13th of March  for the remaining $150.
2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 12th or 13th February 2024. Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?
05/02/24, 5:59 pm - Garima Edoofa: I was expecting your response in the counselling session, but you could not get back to me due to some reason so I am about to finish my second counselling slot for the day, I will have to schedule your session for *Tomorrow at 9:30 AM CAT.*

Please note that I have two counseling slots in a day which are during my working hours from *9:00 am to 4:30 pm on Monday to Friday, and from 9:00 am to 1:00 pm* on Saturday so to complete your application you would have to be present during the time. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning. Therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.
05/02/24, 7:20 pm - +27 84 893 9633: Noted
06/02/24, 8:49 am - Garima Edoofa: Good Morning @263788191268 @27848939633 @263779761576 , Hope you are doing well.

I am here to continue with our session, shall we start?
06/02/24, 11:20 am - +263 78 819 1268: Good morning how are youu
06/02/24, 11:43 am - Garima Edoofa: @27848939633 @263779761576, I would want you to answer this question, please.

06/02/24, 12:25 pm - +263 77 976 1576: We are not financially stable
06/02/24, 1:26 pm - Garima Edoofa: did discuss Marlvine’s application and your challenges with the Academic Board, but you see as per the acting policies and standards the Academic Board is not viable to change the 7-day deadline period. However, the Academic Board has mentioned that they are willing to consider Marlvine's Application if the family faces a challenge in completing the required $200 within the stipulated timeline. As a remedial you can complete a part fee of $100 within the first 7 days, then $100 by the next 21 days, and finally the remaining $150 would be completed in the next 30 days. All in all, for $350 you will have time of 58 days.

Looking at the current situation, I feel this would be convenient for you and your family, isn't it?
06/02/24, 1:28 pm - +263 77 976 1576: Yes it's convenient sure
06/02/24, 1:37 pm - Garima Edoofa: @263779761576   since you have answered all the questions, now a video call will be scheduled with the Program Director, once I submit the evaluation report of Marlvine's application. 

Shall I get you the slots for tomorrow and may I know at what time you are available for the same?
06/02/24, 1:43 pm - +263 77 976 1576: Let me ask the father maybe he will  be available for tomorrow slot me won't be available
06/02/24, 1:49 pm - Garima Edoofa: Yes, please ask.

Since we have limited slots and students are reserving their seats, so I would request you to take out time for tomorrow's interview.
06/02/24, 1:57 pm - +263 77 976 1576: Ok
06/02/24, 2:03 pm - Garima Edoofa: so, shall I give you the slot for 12:00PM CAT?
06/02/24, 2:26 pm - +263 77 976 1576: It's ok
