29/01/24, 8:44 am - Garima Edoofa: Good Morning @263716499268 @263713668818 , Hope you are doing well.

I am here to continue with our session, shall we start?
29/01/24, 8:45 am - +263 71 649 9268: Good morning to you too. We are doing well here.
29/01/24, 8:46 am - +263 71 649 9268: Yes please
29/01/24, 9:42 am - Garima Edoofa: Since you have understood the course properly.

Can you now tell me, if you are provided with this career option, how do you see yourself 5 years after the completion of this course?
And if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
29/01/24, 9:45 am - +263 71 649 9268: In 5 years time I see myself on another big level of being an Economist through the Edoofa Program.
29/01/24, 9:58 am - Garima Edoofa: I appreciate and admire your foresightedness at the same time, Tatenda.

However, as your concierge, I would like to share with you that the career path which you have chosen ahead, will require a lot of hard work and dedication.

So are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way in order to transform your career dear?
29/01/24, 10:02 am - +263 71 649 9268: I am willing to give more than 200% hard work to take the opportunities.
29/01/24, 10:44 am - Garima Edoofa: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
29/01/24, 10:46 am - +263 71 649 9268: Because in my country there are very few resources and also there are no opportunities and jobs.
The Economy is poor as well.
29/01/24, 12:17 pm - Garima Edoofa: Excuse me for the delay in my response, I was in a meeting with the academic board regarding your application.
29/01/24, 12:17 pm - Garima Edoofa: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
29/01/24, 12:25 pm - +263 71 649 9268: If am given the opportunity I can help my country through seminars and websites to share the learnings from abroad and also to write Economics Textbooks that helps the education system in Zimbabwe.
29/01/24, 12:51 pm - Garima Edoofa: I appreciate your sense of hardwork for your community Tatenda, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?
29/01/24, 2:13 pm - +263 71 649 9268: Yes I agree
29/01/24, 2:16 pm - Garima Edoofa: Okay so Tatenda as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
29/01/24, 2:24 pm - +263 71 649 9268: $1500-$2250
29/01/24, 2:24 pm - Garima Edoofa: Exactly Tatenda, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
29/01/24, 2:24 pm - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/01/24, 2:28 pm - +263 71 649 9268: Okay I get it.
29/01/24, 2:33 pm - Garima Edoofa: You see Tatenda this is an amazing aspect about the program itself because for all the students who are found eligible for the Edoofa Program they get the benefit of Edoofa guaranteeing them admission and scholarship by helping them create the statement of purpose along with that they get opportunities where you can apply to multiple universities and receive an offer letter from them without any additional fee, and majorly this enrollment fee also includes the SEELS's Earn While You Learn Program. So apart from the Enrollment fee they wouldn't pay anything separate for their application fee or SOP fee!

So for an Edoofian the Enrollment Fee would include:

*1. Guaranteed Scholarship*
*2. Application fee of all the Edoofa’s Associated Universities*
*3. Cost of Multiple Statement of Purposes drafted*
*4. Recommendation Letter drafted for the Student*
*5. Earn While You Learn Program’s Training*
*6. Visa Assistance*

I hope now you will be in a better position to relate how Exactly Edoofa is trying to bring the change in the Admission process for International Students?
29/01/24, 9:13 pm - +263 71 649 9268: Yes l am relating now.
30/01/24, 9:18 am - Garima Edoofa: Good Morning Tatenda
30/01/24, 9:18 am - Garima Edoofa: I was expecting your response since yesterday, may I know what happened?
30/01/24, 1:02 pm - +263 71 649 9268: Sorry I was out of bundle Ma'am so sorry
30/01/24, 2:15 pm - Garima Edoofa: @263716499268 as of now are we good to have a discussion?
30/01/24, 3:28 pm - +263 71 649 9268: Yes I am.
30/01/24, 3:28 pm - +263 71 649 9268: We can discuss
30/01/24, 4:37 pm - Garima Edoofa: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
30/01/24, 5:20 pm - +263 71 649 9268: Okay
01/02/24, 9:10 am - Garima Edoofa: Good day, @263716499268 @263713668818 ,

I regret the tardiness in my reply. I experienced some personal matters that required my immediate attention, thus delaying my response. Now that I have returned, we can commence our session now.
01/02/24, 9:22 am - +263 71 649 9268: Yes please
01/02/24, 9:31 am - Garima Edoofa: Tatenda Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
01/02/24, 9:31 am - Garima Edoofa: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
01/02/24, 9:39 am - +263 71 649 9268: Okay
01/02/24, 9:39 am - +263 71 649 9268: Understood
01/02/24, 9:41 am - Garima Edoofa: Tatenda, as we have discussed about the payment policy of the Enrollment fee and other finances of the program as well, so can you share with me what all did you understand about the financial aspect of the program and how Edoofa helps a student arrange and pay his finances all by himself (in 80 to 100 words)?
01/02/24, 10:04 am - +263 71 649 9268: Edoofa offers the SEEL's EWLP  that helps to reduce fees. It covers a part of the enrollment fee and gives a period of time for a student to pay.
01/02/24, 10:05 am - Garima Edoofa: Let me summarize the financial aspects for you
*Enrollment fee*
The enrollment fee is $350 out of which you need to pay only $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 is to be paid in next 30 days 
 
For all the services and assistance including Applications,SOP,Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection, and sessions etc all you need to pay is $350
 
 
*Cost of education*
The cost of education is reduced from $6000-$8000 to $2000-$3000 per annum which includes Tuition fee,Accommodation,Food,Wifi,Laundry,Library,Gym fee etc!
 
This cost can be further reduced through the earnings from Earn While You Learn program.
01/02/24, 10:05 am - Garima Edoofa: I hope now you are clear?
01/02/24, 10:08 am - +263 71 649 9268: So the cost of education is paid by the Earn While You Learn Program?
01/02/24, 10:17 am - Garima Edoofa: I would like to correct you that the Earn While You Learn Program is a program from which students can reduce their tuition fees and some students have even paid their tuition fees all by themselves by earning credits through The Earn While You Learn Program.
01/02/24, 10:18 am - +263 71 649 9268: Okay Ma'am
01/02/24, 10:19 am - Garima Edoofa: Yes Tatenda and I hope that you have understood how it totally depends upon the student to make his/her higher education affordable with the help of the Earn While You Learn Program's Scholarship Credits?
01/02/24, 10:25 am - +263 71 649 9268: So how can one starts the program
01/02/24, 10:38 am - Garima Edoofa: Let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
01/02/24, 10:38 am - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
01/02/24, 10:39 am - Garima Edoofa: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zimbabwe itself.
01/02/24, 10:39 am - Garima Edoofa: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
01/02/24, 10:42 am - +263 71 649 9268: Yes I do understand
01/02/24, 10:43 am - Garima Edoofa: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that 
particular University chosen by you.
01/02/24, 10:43 am - Garima Edoofa: Basically, this registration fee of ($500-$1000) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 instalments*. The first part will be paid in Coming few months of (2024-2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).

*After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
01/02/24, 10:44 am - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
01/02/24, 10:44 am - Garima Edoofa: So now would you like to ask anything?
01/02/24, 10:45 am - +263 71 649 9268: No questions
01/02/24, 10:47 am - Garima Edoofa: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
01/02/24, 10:47 am - Garima Edoofa: Mrs.Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)
01/02/24, 10:47 am - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
01/02/24, 10:48 am - Garima Edoofa: Do connect Mrs. Ruth with your parents as well Tatenda.
01/02/24, 10:48 am - Garima Edoofa: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
01/02/24, 10:48 am - Garima Edoofa: And for any questions apart from whatever we have explained, I would appreciate it if you refer your family to the FAQ document which has all the answers to most of the queries which generally parents have.

Your scholarship journey is reaching a crucial juncture. *Friday on “02-02-24” at 10:00 AM CAT,* I will meticulously evaluate your application. This session is not just about answering your questions; it includes a vital Eligibility Check Interview.

We strongly recommend parents/guardians join, recognizing that higher education is a family decision. Prepare for a series of interviews, marking a significant phase in finalizing your scholarship application. As your counselor, I wish you the very best. It's been a pleasure guiding you through your career sessions.

If you qualify for the interview, *Senior Career Counselor Mr Sahil would be getting in touch*, we look forward to welcoming you to India. Please be proactive, as everyone's time is valuable. The Senior Counselor and Director will make decisions based on your interview and adhere strictly to the given time. Follow instructions diligently, and if the session is completed within the allotted time, your application will proceed.

Mrs. Ruth's experience with Edoofa is a testament to the transformative impact our programs can have. She not only managed her family's needs but also seized the opportunity for her daughters to achieve higher education. The support and guidance she received from Edoofa were instrumental in her success.
The process was challenging, yet incredibly rewarding. Mrs. Ruth's determination, combined with Edoofa's assistance, has paved the way for a brighter future .

02/02/24, 5:59 pm - +263 71 366 8818: Yess we are
02/02/24, 6:00 pm - +263 77 815 6886: <Media omitted>
02/02/24, 6:00 pm - Garima Edoofa: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
02/02/24, 6:00 pm - Garima Edoofa: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
02/02/24, 6:00 pm - Garima Edoofa: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.
02/02/24, 6:00 pm - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
02/02/24, 6:02 pm - Garima Edoofa: Ideally as you know, the tentative dates:
1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 9th or 10th February  2024 for $200 and the 9th or 10th of march  for the remaining $150.
2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 9th or 10th February 2024. Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?
02/02/24, 6:15 pm - Garima Edoofa: I was expecting your response in the counselling session, but you could not get back to me due to some reason so I am about to finish my second counselling slot for the day, I will have to schedule your session for *Tomorrow at 9:30 AM CAT.*

Please note that I have two counseling slots in a day which are during my working hours from *9:00 am to 4:30 pm on Monday to Friday, and from 9:00 am to 1:00 pm* on Saturday so to complete your application you would have to be present during the time.

I am here to continue with our session, shall we start?
06/02/24, 5:39 pm - Garima Edoofa: Hi, I hope you are doing well.

I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons which I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship. 

I will be waiting for your response.
