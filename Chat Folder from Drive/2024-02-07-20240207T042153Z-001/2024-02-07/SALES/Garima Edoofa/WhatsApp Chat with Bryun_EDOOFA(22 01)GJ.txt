I am here to continue with our session, shall we start?
24/01/24, 8:55 am - +263 71 544 5511: I don't know about my mom and sister there will be working
24/01/24, 10:06 am - +27 61 820 6236: Good morning how are you
24/01/24, 10:07 am - +27 61 820 6236: On the pdf that you sent there are some issues that are not clear
24/01/24, 10:08 am - +27 61 820 6236: I wanted to understand if you still fund people if they want to further their education here in Zimbabwe and not India
24/01/24, 10:08 am - +27 61 820 6236: Also the percentage of funding is not stated.it only states that you do not do full funding as inky a few students get them
24/01/24, 10:11 am - Garima Edoofa: Can you please elaborate on this? what exactly you mean by this, please?
24/01/24, 10:14 am - +263 71 544 5511: Isn't edoofa for India studies only
24/01/24, 10:34 am - Garima Edoofa: May I know why do you want your child to study in Zimbabwe.
24/01/24, 10:54 am - +27 61 626 6440: For security reasons.since they are so many cases of children being abused
24/01/24, 11:02 am - +27 61 820 6236: Okay, sorry I just assumed it's a funding for any country one wants to study at
24/01/24, 12:45 pm - Garima Edoofa: I'd like to address your statement about India being an attractive destination for students from 128 countries. If there were concerns about child abuse, it seems unlikely that such a significant number of students would choose to study there. Our organization, with a 14-year history of working in Africa and assisting over 6000 families, has observed that students are content, and their families express satisfaction. This positive feedback contributes to the decision of many students to pursue tertiary education in India. Additionally, it's crucial to note that India maintains a zero-tolerance policy towards such activities, and those found guilty face legal consequences, including imprisonment.

If you wish, I can facilitate connections with students currently studying in India, allowing you to directly inquire about their experiences and the treatment they receive.

Can you now tell me, if you are provided with this career option, how do you see yourself 5 years after the completion of this course?
And if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
02/02/24, 11:58 am - +263 71 544 5511: Well india is one of the best nations in the world with a good space program
02/02/24, 12:01 pm - +263 71 544 5511: Well with the edoofa program I'm sure i will be good and i will get the necessary skills to be  a good aerospace engineer
02/02/24, 12:02 pm - +263 71 544 5511: And yes this program will archive my dreams
02/02/24, 12:03 pm - Garima Edoofa: I appreciate and admire your foresightedness at the same time, Bryun.

However, as your concierge, I would like to share with you that the career path which you have chosen ahead, will require a lot of hard work and dedication.

So are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way in order to transform your career dear?
02/02/24, 12:07 pm - +263 71 544 5511: 😂😂 i will truly give it my best 200 % as you said
02/02/24, 12:28 pm - Garima Edoofa: I would want you to be serious as this group is specially made for your counseling sessions.
02/02/24, 2:02 pm - +263 71 544 5511: As of course i am serious
02/02/24, 2:03 pm - +263 71 544 5511: This is a wonderful opportunity for my undergraduate studies
02/02/24, 2:17 pm - Garima Edoofa: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
02/02/24, 2:18 pm - +263 71 544 5511: Well it's because first of all the program is not taught in Zimbabwe
02/02/24, 2:19 pm - +263 71 544 5511: Because India does have space stations it would be great working with people who have experience in this field
02/02/24, 2:20 pm - +263 71 544 5511: And also the Zimbabwean school fees rise very day with no notices
02/02/24, 2:22 pm - Garima Edoofa: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
02/02/24, 2:26 pm - +263 71 544 5511: Well first i would like the program to be taught in my country so people would have degrees on it
To start a space station which creates rockets , satellites so we can explore the great universe
02/02/24, 2:28 pm - +263 71 544 5511: Well basically it's all about developing, education and employing my country
02/02/24, 2:29 pm - Garima Edoofa: I appreciate your sense of hardwork for your community Bryun, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?
02/02/24, 2:30 pm - +263 71 544 5511: Yes that's very true
02/02/24, 2:31 pm - Garima Edoofa: As you are aware, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
02/02/24, 2:32 pm - +263 71 544 5511: Yeah i would love to know

02/02/24, 2:33 pm - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
02/02/24, 2:33 pm - Garima Edoofa: May I know if you understood everything properly?
02/02/24, 2:38 pm - +263 71 544 5511: Wow India is a great country really
02/02/24, 2:39 pm - +263 71 544 5511: Truly it's a technology hub
02/02/24, 3:27 pm - Garima Edoofa: It is indeed.
02/02/24, 3:28 pm - Garima Edoofa: Okay well Bryun, since you have understood all the reasons properly as well, can you now tell me:-

1)How would studying in India implement a positive impact on your career?

2)How do you aim to achieve your career aspirations from studying in India?
02/02/24, 3:45 pm - +263 71 544 5511: 1) well since I'm learning in a country with both theory and practical experience i think i would have a better understanding in india and exploring new people and new culture
02/02/24, 3:47 pm - +263 71 544 5511: 2) Studying in India would be a great way to broaden my horizons and gain new perspectives on the world. India is a diverse and dynamic country with a rich culture and history, and I think it would be fascinating to experience this firsthand. I would also be able to learn from some of the best minds in the world, as India is home to many prestigious universities. And finally, I think that the experience of living and studying in India would make me a more well-rounded and cultured individual, which would be beneficial for my future career.
02/02/24, 3:48 pm - Garima Edoofa: That is remarkable, Bryun. I see that you understand the quality of higher education that Edoofa seeks to deliver to its students so that after completing their education, the students are capable of achieving their career goals and having a prosperous career ahead of them.

Okay, so are you or any of your family members aware of the expense of a comparable quality higher education for an international student without a scholarship in India?
02/02/24, 3:50 pm - +263 71 544 5511: Yes but money is a problem to everyone so we do consider that
02/02/24, 3:52 pm - Garima Edoofa: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is *around 6000-8000 USD. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from USD 15000 to USD 35000. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 6-year degree ranging from USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000*.

Now as we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with over 250+ Universities for the last 14 + years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 5 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
02/02/24, 3:52 pm - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
02/02/24, 3:53 pm - Garima Edoofa: Therefore, for the selected students who can qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year, but as some courses are niche in nature like *Aerospace Engineering* itself is a course which has fewer scholarships seats, which is why for you the Annual fee after the scholarship would be between *$2700-$3700*. This cost includes:
	1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)
	2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)
	3. Food
	4. Accommodation
02/02/24, 3:54 pm - Garima Edoofa: So, don't you think it is affordable for your family?
02/02/24, 3:55 pm - +263 71 544 5511: So you mean after scholarships it's 2700
02/02/24, 3:55 pm - +263 71 544 5511: If we can afford you can hear from my mother
02/02/24, 3:57 pm - +263 71 544 5511: I did understand
02/02/24, 3:57 pm - +263 71 544 5511: So is there like a payment plan
02/02/24, 4:09 pm - Garima Edoofa: May I know what do you exactly mean by the payment plan?
02/02/24, 4:10 pm - +263 71 544 5511: Do qe pay it all at once or we can pay per semester or monthly
02/02/24, 4:15 pm - Garima Edoofa: @263715445511 I would like to tell you since I mentioned above that Aerospace Engineering is a niche course so hence it will cost $2700-$3700, moreover in a niche course like Aerospace Engineering there are a limited number of seats, which is why Annual fee after the scholarship would be between *$2700-$3700*.
02/02/24, 4:24 pm - Garima Edoofa: @263715445511 I would advise you to exercise patience, as the information provided pertains solely to the annual fee range. Following the eligibility check interview with the Program Director, and upon successful completion thereof, our admissions team will guide you through the payment plan details.
02/02/24, 4:50 pm - +263 71 544 5511: Thank you truly
02/02/24, 4:50 pm - +263 71 544 5511: I think now my mother as a say on the fees part
02/02/24, 5:36 pm - Garima Edoofa: In simple words Bryun what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3700 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food, and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
02/02/24, 5:59 pm - Garima Edoofa: I was expecting your response in the counselling session, but you could not get back to me due to some reason so I am about to finish my second counselling slot for the day, I will have to schedule your session for *Tomorrow at 9:30 AM CAT.*

Please note that I have two counseling slots in a day which are during my working hours from *9:00 am to 4:30 pm on Monday to Friday, and from 9:00 am to 1:00 pm* on Saturday so to complete your application you would have to be present during the time. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning. Therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.
03/02/24, 9:31 am - Garima Edoofa: Good Morning @263715445511 @27616266440 , Hope you are doing well.

I am here to continue with our session, shall we start?
03/02/24, 9:32 am - +27 61 626 6440: Morning morning
03/02/24, 9:44 am - Garima Edoofa: So, shall I brief you about the The Earn While You Learn Program?
03/02/24, 9:44 am - +27 61 626 6440: Yes please
03/02/24, 9:45 am - Garima Edoofa: The Earn While You Learn Program or the *EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program*. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
03/02/24, 9:45 am - Garima Edoofa: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.


1. *Projects with Brands and Companies*: -

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0

-Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
03/02/24, 9:45 am - Garima Edoofa: 2. *Recruitment Partners*: -

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
03/02/24, 9:45 am - Garima Edoofa: 3. *Webinars*: -

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi
How to be industry ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu
It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje
Decoding the science of personal branding by Mr, Simon Maingi
03/02/24, 9:47 am - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
03/02/24, 9:47 am - Garima Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases. 

What are your views on the same? Do you think this will be benefiting you?
03/02/24, 10:01 am - +27 61 626 6440: Will reply soon when I finish reading
03/02/24, 10:14 am - Garima Edoofa: Alright, please.

I will be waiting for your response.
03/02/24, 11:05 am - +263 71 544 5511: Morning
03/02/24, 11:07 am - Garima Edoofa: Greetings @263715445511 , Hope you are doing well.
03/02/24, 11:08 am - +263 71 544 5511: I'm okay thanks
03/02/24, 11:10 am - +263 71 544 5511: This is good
03/02/24, 11:12 am - +263 71 544 5511: This would help in learning and financial
03/02/24, 11:12 am - Garima Edoofa: Can you please answer this question?
03/02/24, 11:12 am - Garima Edoofa: Yes definitely.
03/02/24, 11:17 am - +263 71 544 5511: Yes i think it definitely helps
03/02/24, 11:20 am - Garima Edoofa: That is great to know, so now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food, and accommodation*, which means for the monthly family cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
03/02/24, 11:20 am - Garima Edoofa: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

03/02/24, 11:21 am - +263 71 544 5511: Wow it's great i could help pay my own fees
03/02/24, 11:22 am - +263 71 544 5511: I think it's a great opportunity
03/02/24, 11:22 am - Garima Edoofa: Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :

1.*Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*​: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses,which is completely waived off.
 
2.*Employability through practical training*​: We believe Students shouldn't just learn in theory, they should gain real-world experience instead of academic theory. That is why we help them by designing a practical employment oriented curriculum that helps students pick up job skills needed to be employable.
 
 
3.*Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing and involving. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What’s more, students earn scholarship credits in the process, thereby further reducing the burden of the cost of their education.
 
 
4.*Higher Education Concierge*​: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.
03/02/24, 11:23 am - Garima Edoofa: So, after looking over the facts that distinguish Edoofa, which of the four points did you appreciate the most?
03/02/24, 11:25 am - +263 71 544 5511: Learning though practical experience 
Job guaranty after school 
Schoo fees cut 
Help pay my own fees
03/02/24, 11:30 am - Garima Edoofa: I am delighted to know that you have been looking for the same.


Alright Bryun, basically, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
03/02/24, 12:55 pm - +263 71 544 5511: Yes that's true
03/02/24, 12:56 pm - +263 71 544 5511: That's one of the most special parts
03/02/24, 1:02 pm - Garima Edoofa: Alright Bryun, basically once we complete your counseling session I would give you time to properly discuss about your entire application once again with your family members so that they too could have much better clarity regarding the same. Meanwhile, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
03/02/24, 1:05 pm - +263 71 544 5511: Not yet wd Don't have electricity at the moment  today being online is hard
03/02/24, 1:05 pm - +263 71 544 5511: My phone is at 15%
03/02/24, 1:20 pm - Garima Edoofa: Alright then in that case we will be reconnecting on Monday at 9:30 AM CAT.

05/02/24, 9:07 am - Garima Edoofa: Good Morning @263715445511 @27616266440 , Hope you are doing well.

I am here to continue with our session, shall we start?
05/02/24, 12:02 pm - +27 61 626 6440: Fine and you

05/02/24, 12:09 pm - Garima Edoofa: Shall we start?
05/02/24, 12:12 pm - +27 61 626 6440: Yes
05/02/24, 12:13 pm - Garima Edoofa: @27616266440 as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
05/02/24, 12:18 pm - +27 61 626 6440: 5 universities at 300$ is 1500$ and 5 at 450 is $2259
05/02/24, 12:25 pm - Garima Edoofa: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
05/02/24, 12:26 pm - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
05/02/24, 12:26 pm - Garima Edoofa: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
05/02/24, 12:26 pm - Garima Edoofa: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education.

Don’t you think so?
05/02/24, 12:54 pm - +27 61 626 6440: That's great u are helping a lot
05/02/24, 1:03 pm - Garima Edoofa: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
05/02/24, 1:04 pm - Garima Edoofa: @27616266440 basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
05/02/24, 1:04 pm - Garima Edoofa: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
05/02/24, 1:07 pm - +27 61 626 6440: Oh ok I understand everything now
05/02/24, 1:55 pm - Garima Edoofa: @27616266440 , as we have discussed about the payment policy of the Enrollment fee and other finances of the program as well, so can you share with me what all did you understand about the financial aspect of the program and how Edoofa helps a student arrange and pay his finances all by himself (in 80 to 100 words)?
05/02/24, 1:58 pm - +27 61 626 6440: Ok will reply soon now I am a bit tied up with work
05/02/24, 2:01 pm - Garima Edoofa: Let me summarize the financial aspects for you
*Enrollment fee*
The enrollment fee is $350 out of which you need to pay only $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 is to be paid in next 30 days 
 
For all the services and assistance including Applications,SOP,Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection, and sessions etc all you need to pay is $350
 
 
*Cost of education*
The cost of education is reduced from $6000-$8000 to $2700-$3700 per annum which includes Tuition fee,Accommodation,Food,Wifi,Laundry,Library,Gym fee etc!
 
This cost can be further reduced through the earnings from Earn While You Learn program. <This message was edited>
05/02/24, 2:02 pm - Garima Edoofa: I hope now you are clear?
05/02/24, 5:02 pm - +27 61 626 6440: Yes
05/02/24, 5:03 pm - Garima Edoofa: Yes @27616266440 and I hope that you have understood how it totally depends upon the student to make his/her higher education affordable with the help of the Earn While You Learn Program's Scholarship Credits?
05/02/24, 5:10 pm - +27 61 626 6440: Yes I did understand
05/02/24, 5:54 pm - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
05/02/24, 5:54 pm - Garima Edoofa: Let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
05/02/24, 5:55 pm - Garima Edoofa: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zimbabwe itself.
05/02/24, 5:55 pm - Garima Edoofa: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
05/02/24, 6:12 pm - Garima Edoofa: Are we still connected?
05/02/24, 6:26 pm - Garima Edoofa: I was expecting your response in the counselling session, but you could not get back to me due to some reason so I am about to finish my second counselling slot for the day, I will have to schedule your session for *Tomorrow at 9:30 AM CAT.*

Please note that I have two counseling slots in a day which are during my working hours from *9:00 am to 4:30 pm on Monday to Friday, and from 9:00 am to 1:00 pm* on Saturday so to complete your application you would have to be present during the time. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning. Therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.
