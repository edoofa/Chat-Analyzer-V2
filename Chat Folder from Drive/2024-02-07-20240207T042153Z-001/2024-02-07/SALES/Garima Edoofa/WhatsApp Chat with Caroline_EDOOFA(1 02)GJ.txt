Sleep well
03/02/24, 9:37 am - Garima Edoofa: Good Morning @263775339661 @263772433670 , Hope you are doing well.

I am here to continue with our session, shall we start?
03/02/24, 9:55 am - +263 77 533 9661: Good morning
We can start
03/02/24, 10:16 am - Garima Edoofa: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
03/02/24, 10:20 am - +263 77 533 9661: I think the are more opportunities and a wider  of choices outside my country
03/02/24, 11:18 am - Garima Edoofa: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
03/02/24, 11:29 am - +263 77 533 9661: The education system in my country as far as am concerned is not really bad. It is the opportunities and employment which are scarce. So learning from abroad will then maximise my chances and opportunity to improve the educational system and work industry in my country. In terms of technology Zimbabwe is a bit babbarick and backward as compared to other Asian and European countries. Studying abroad will definitely be of a benefit to me and others by applying what i have learnt abroad.
03/02/24, 11:32 am - Garima Edoofa: I appreciate your sense of hard work for your community Caroline, but to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?
03/02/24, 11:37 am - +263 77 533 9661: I agree with you
03/02/24, 11:52 am - Garima Edoofa: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
03/02/24, 12:59 pm - +263 77 533 9661: True
03/02/24, 12:59 pm - Garima Edoofa: The Edoofa Scholarship Program is only focused in India, because of the following reasons

05/02/24, 2:12 pm - Garima Edoofa: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is *around 6000-9000 USD. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from USD 15000 to USD 35000. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 6-year degree ranging from USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000*.

Now as we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with over 250+ Universities for the last 14 + years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 5 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
05/02/24, 2:13 pm - Garima Edoofa: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year, but as some courses are niche in nature like **Master of Legislative Laws** itself is a course which has fewer scholarship seats, which is why for you the Annual fee after the scholarship would be between *$3000-$4000*. This cost includes:
	1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)
	2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)
	3. Food
	4. Accommodation
05/02/24, 2:13 pm - Garima Edoofa: So, Don't you think it is affordable for your family?

06/02/24, 8:51 am - Garima Edoofa: Good Morning @263775339661 @263772433670 , Hope you are doing well.

I am here to continue with our session, shall we start?
06/02/24, 10:23 am - +263 77 533 9661: Yes we can start
06/02/24, 10:23 am - +263 77 533 9661: $3000-$4000 is quite alot
06/02/24, 11:35 am - Garima Edoofa: @263775339661 I would like to inform you that since your application was sent for evaluation I would like to tell you since you have not done a bachelor's degree in LAW so, therefore, you are not eligible for the master's degree in law, if you wish to pursue law then, in that case, you have pursued a bachelor's degree in LAW.

Since you have already pursued sociology in your graduation, As your counselor I would suggest you not pursue a Bachelor's degree again and instead do an MBA which is a master's in Business Administration, as you mentioned that after doing the bachelor's degree in sociology you were stilled unemployed, so I would suggest you to go for a degree that would reward you for your future. Considering the cost of doing an MBA will vary from $2000-$3000.
