05/02/24, 3:50 pm - Garima Edoofa: Good Afternoon, I hope this finds you well,

I am Ms. Garima, Career Counselor at Edoofa.

We have received an application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program for Hellen Madzamba

I hope I have contacted the right person?
05/02/24, 6:10 pm - Garima Edoofa: I was expecting your response in the counselling session, but you could not get back to me due to some reason so I am about to finish my second counselling slot for the day, I will have to schedule your session for *Tomorrow at 9:30 AM CAT.*

Please note that I have two counseling slots in a day which are during my working hours from *9:00 am to 4:30 pm on Monday to Friday, and from 9:00 am to 1:00 pm* on Saturday so to complete your application you would have to be present during the time. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning. Therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.
06/02/24, 8:52 am - Garima Edoofa: Good Morning @263783434161 , Hope you are doing well.

I am here to continue with our session, shall we start?
06/02/24, 5:40 pm - Garima Edoofa: Hi, I hope you are doing well.

I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons which I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship. 

I will be waiting for your response.
