*Required Skill-Set for BA LLB*
It is rightly said that learning is an on – going process and this holds true especially in the aspect of personal and professional development. Although an individual may possess certain skills they need to be improved and developed constantly. A few key skills that are of paramount importance in the field of law are:
*Good Written Communication*– Writing forms a major part of the work in in the legal profession. The written communication involves letters, documents, notices, and so on. The documents must be grammatically correct and error free. This requires a good level of English proficiency.
*Good Verbal Communication*– A lot depends on how well the legal professional can express his or her case, arguments and generally converse with clients and authorities. Good verbal communication ensures good expression and understanding which are crucial for a successful career in law.
*Good Time Management*– In the legal profession, time management is very crucial. The art of delegating tasks, working within deadlines, and prioritizing tasks to achieve success is very essential.
*A great degree of self-confidence*– This profession needs a high degree of self-confidence to win the clients’ trust. A strong belief in yourself will go a long way in winning arguments and cases.
*An analytical mind and good research skills*– A case with proper research and well-reasoned out and evaluated argument stands a very high chance of success.
*High EQ (Emotional Quotient)*– Individuals in the legal profession, especially lawyers, must learn to be empathetic.
*Tech Savvy*– In the rapidly developing and evolving technological world, they must be abreast of the latest technology to understand and use it, as and when needed. They need to use technology to their advantage to improve their efficiency and chances of success.

*A high degree of patience*– This is a much needed skill, since you deal with different types of people and some cases and procedures stretch over a period of time which need a lot of patience and careful handling.
*Team player skills*– Since a legal professional will deal with a lot of people therefore to be effective they need to bond with people. The art of getting work done and obtaining information though networking and working with people helps in attaining the objectives.
02/02/24, 1:11 pm - Garima Edoofa: I would want you to go through the course and understand it and inform me once it is done.
02/02/24, 2:05 pm - +263 78 988 8134: It seems like it's a bit different from the course I want
02/02/24, 2:08 pm - +263 78 988 8134: Because from my understanding when l was reading about the course it seems like l won't be dealing with casea on my own as l wished but rather working alongside other which l see being a disadvantage
02/02/24, 4:08 pm - Garima Edoofa: May I know why this course does not align with you since you only mentioned you wished to study Law.
02/02/24, 4:20 pm - +263 78 988 8134: According to how l understood the concept being nallified above abt the Bachelor's of Arts in legislative law if one studies the course the person does not get the full responsibility in ones case but act as an assistant beside the actual lawyer which is not with my passion as my greatest passion is to be the lawyer not an assistant
02/02/24, 5:41 pm - Garima Edoofa: I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you on *tomorrow again at 9:30 AM CAT* to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind.

03/02/24, 10:39 am - +263 78 988 8134: And also Edoofa will enable me to achieve my dreams because in terms of financial stability my parents might find it hard to get  all the finances needed in five years and one might find out that without Edoofa in five years l might end up not in school but tracking in streets without anything tangible <This message was edited>
03/02/24, 10:54 am - Garima Edoofa: I appreciate and admire your foresightedness at the same time, Tadiwanashe

However, as your concierge, I would like to share with you that the career path which you have chosen ahead, will require a lot of hard work and dedication.

So are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way in order to transform your career dear?

03/02/24, 11:22 am - Garima Edoofa: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
03/02/24, 11:27 am - +263 78 988 8134: Oky l would want to study abroad because l can get the chance to experience a different culture which will even make it easy for me to understand different perspectives of lives
03/02/24, 11:29 am - Garima Edoofa: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, me that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
03/02/24, 11:29 am - +263 78 988 8134: And also it strenthens and even create a stable relation between nations
03/02/24, 11:37 am - +263 78 988 8134: Oky if l get the opportunity to persue my higher education through Edoofa l will contribute my learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in my country by fostering the transferring of modern systems and ideas with a well informed mindset and wider perspectives towards other cultures and people thus the education in my country ends up being developed as people will now have the zill of other cultures <This message was edited>
03/02/24, 11:39 am - Garima Edoofa: I appreciate your sense of hard work for your community Tadiwanashe, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?
03/02/24, 11:44 am - +263 78 988 8134: Yes l do agree
03/02/24, 11:45 am - Garima Edoofa: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
03/02/24, 11:48 am - +263 78 988 8134: Yes it is and lead also going to ask on that
03/02/24, 11:51 am - Garima Edoofa: The Edoofa Scholarship Program is only focused in India, because of the following reasons

03/02/24, 11:52 am - +263 78 988 8134: Okay l will let you know
03/02/24, 11:53 am - Garima Edoofa: Yes, please.
I will be waiting for your response.
03/02/24, 11:54 am - +263 77 532 1563: I also want to knowa about tbat too. Why only India
03/02/24, 11:54 am - +263 78 988 8134: Oky
03/02/24, 11:57 am - Garima Edoofa: I would want you to go through the above message that I have send.
03/02/24, 12:22 pm - +263 78 988 8134: Have now understood the reason behind
03/02/24, 12:35 pm - Garima Edoofa: Alright, please.
03/02/24, 12:35 pm - Garima Edoofa: Okay well Tadiwanashe, since you have understood all the reasons properly as well, can you now tell me:-

1)How would studying in India implement a positive impact on your career?

2)How do you aim to achieve your career aspirations from studying in India?
03/02/24, 12:50 pm - +263 78 988 8134: Studying in india will implement a positive impact on my career as it provide one with innovative opportunities and also it has an advantage of using English as it is an international language which is basically acceptable in the whole world thereby providing one with the opportunity to communicate with a wider range of people in the world in cases of resolution and also it is affordable and offers schoolarships which is an advantage to students to study and improve their educational qualifications
03/02/24, 12:53 pm - Garima Edoofa: That is remarkable, Tadiwanashe. I see that you understand the quality of higher education that Edoofa seeks to deliver to its students so that after completing their education, the students are capable of achieving their career goals and having a prosperous career ahead of them.

Okay, so are you or any of your family members aware of the expense of a comparable quality higher education for an international student without a scholarship in India?
03/02/24, 12:56 pm - +263 78 988 8134: No we are not aware  u  help on that
03/02/24, 12:58 pm - Garima Edoofa: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is *around 6000-8000 USD. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from USD 15000 to USD 35000. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 6-year degree ranging from USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000*.

Now as we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with over 250+ Universities for the last 14 + years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 5 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
03/02/24, 12:59 pm - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
03/02/24, 12:59 pm - Garima Edoofa: So, don't you think it is affordable for your family?
03/02/24, 1:41 pm - +263 78 988 8134: If l say they can l will be lying to myself as the other reason which drove me into applying to Edoofa was Economic instabilities in terms of fonance
03/02/24, 2:07 pm - Garima Edoofa: In simple words Tadiwanashe, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
03/02/24, 2:07 pm - Garima Edoofa: However as per my experience, I can share with you that *if you are able to perform and clear all these criteria with a high passing grade, you would be eligible for higher quantum of Scholarship*, in which you will just have to pay a minimal fee of *$1200-$1800*, Which would cover your entire fees be it food, accommodation, Tuition etc.

What are your thoughts on the same?
03/02/24, 2:29 pm - +263 78 988 8134: Ooooh okay okay l get it and l suppose that after the schoolarship has been provided my parents are able to pay the money left on fees
03/02/24, 2:30 pm - +263 78 988 8134: Yeah yeah that is a loving proposition as it could lower the price of my total expenses
03/02/24, 2:31 pm - Garima Edoofa: Yes, indeed.
03/02/24, 2:31 pm - Garima Edoofa: So, now shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program?
03/02/24, 2:31 pm - +263 78 988 8134: Yes you can
03/02/24, 2:32 pm - Garima Edoofa: The Earn While You Learn Program or the *EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program*. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
03/02/24, 2:33 pm - Garima Edoofa: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.


1. *Projects with Brands and Companies*: -

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0

-Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
03/02/24, 2:33 pm - Garima Edoofa: 2. *Recruitment Partners*: -

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
03/02/24, 2:33 pm - Garima Edoofa: 3. *Webinars*: -

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi
How to be industry ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu
It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje
Decoding the science of personal branding by Mr, Simon Maingi
03/02/24, 2:33 pm - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
03/02/24, 2:33 pm - Garima Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases. 

What are your views on the same? Do you think this will be benefiting you?
03/02/24, 2:49 pm - Garima Edoofa: I was expecting your response in the counselling session, but you could not get back to me due to some reason so I am about to finish my second counselling slot for the day, I will have to schedule your session for *Monday at 9:30 AM CAT.*

Please note that I have two counseling slots in a day which are during my working hours from *9:00 am to 4:30 pm on Monday to Friday, and from 9:00 am to 1:00 pm* on Saturday so to complete your application you would have to be present during the time. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning. Therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.
03/02/24, 3:34 pm - +263 78 988 8134: Okay oky will be waiting for the Monday Counselling session ma'am by the way l am replying lately due to some reasons something came up that l could not stay online
05/02/24, 9:01 am - Garima Edoofa: Good Morning @263789888134 @263773422069 @263775321563 , Hope you are doing well.

I am here to continue with our session, shall we start?
05/02/24, 9:03 am - +263 78 988 8134: Good morning Ms hwu doing today
05/02/24, 9:05 am - +263 78 988 8134: Continueing from where we left l have seen this being beneficial as l could invest my own money to cater for my education
05/02/24, 9:09 am - +263 77 342 2069: Morning .. let's continue .. due to pressure of wrk l will be in and out ...
05/02/24, 9:16 am - Garima Edoofa: That is great to know, so now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food, and accommodation*, which means for the monthly family cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
05/02/24, 9:16 am - Garima Edoofa: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

05/02/24, 9:28 am - +263 78 988 8134: Ofcourse l have been looking for something like that who will not want such a great thing to happen to him or her where u are being paid for learning so as to sponsor your education l will be grateful to join the program after getting the schoolarship
05/02/24, 9:35 am - +263 78 988 8134: This video brings motivation in ones mind even if you were not interested in the Edoofa program u will end up being part of it kkkk because l can even see myself being financially independent in the future five years of my education being able to pay for my tuition fees on my own and even lowering the financial burden for my parents ....now l have seen why Edoofa is different from others
05/02/24, 9:43 am - +263 77 532 1563: Morning  this is good it just needs effort from the student
05/02/24, 10:37 am - Garima Edoofa: I am really glad that you are excited for the program.
05/02/24, 10:37 am - Garima Edoofa: That is great to know, so now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year.

05/02/24, 10:39 am - +263 78 988 8134: And l have commented on this one as it brings motivation in one
05/02/24, 10:40 am - Garima Edoofa: Certainly, I apologize for any confusion, as this message was intended for the other participant who is nearing completion of the enrollment process.
05/02/24, 10:40 am - +263 78 988 8134: How is the EWYL program registered
05/02/24, 10:41 am - Garima Edoofa: @263789888134 not to worry moving forward in our sessions, we will be answering all your questions.
05/02/24, 10:41 am - Garima Edoofa: Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :

1.*Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*​: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses,which is completely waived off.
 
2.*Employability through practical training*​: We believe Students shouldn't just learn in theory, they should gain real-world experience instead of academic theory. That is why we help them by designing a practical employment oriented curriculum that helps students pick up job skills needed to be employable.
 
 
3.*Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing and involving. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What’s more, students earn scholarship credits in the process, thereby further reducing the burden of the cost of their education.
 
 
4.*Higher Education Concierge*​: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.
05/02/24, 10:41 am - Garima Edoofa: So, after looking over the facts that distinguish Edoofa, which of the four points did you appreciate the most?
05/02/24, 10:43 am - +263 78 988 8134: Oooh okay it is fine
05/02/24, 10:44 am - +263 78 988 8134: Okay okay
05/02/24, 10:44 am - Garima Edoofa: Yes, please.
05/02/24, 10:44 am - Garima Edoofa: Can you please answer this question.
05/02/24, 10:47 am - +263 78 988 8134: I can't say l have any one to appreciate more than the others as all these four are appreciable l appreciate them all
05/02/24, 10:47 am - +263 78 988 8134: Ok
05/02/24, 10:48 am - Garima Edoofa: I am delighted to know that you have been looking for the same.


Alright Tadiwanashe, basically, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
05/02/24, 10:52 am - +263 78 988 8134: Yes they will be the one who will be supporting me
05/02/24, 11:05 am - Garima Edoofa: Alright @263789888134 , basically once we complete your counseling session I would give you time to properly discuss about your entire application once again with your family members so that they too could have much better clarity regarding the same. Meanwhile, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
05/02/24, 11:15 am - +263 78 988 8134: Yes l am ready
05/02/24, 11:16 am - Garima Edoofa: @263789888134 as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
05/02/24, 11:20 am - +263 78 988 8134: Will end up spending a lot of about 1500 to 2250
05/02/24, 11:21 am - Garima Edoofa: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
05/02/24, 11:21 am - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
05/02/24, 11:21 am - Garima Edoofa: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
05/02/24, 11:22 am - Garima Edoofa: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education.

Don’t you think so?
05/02/24, 11:24 am - +263 78 988 8134: Which will carter for all the applications right
05/02/24, 11:25 am - +263 78 988 8134: Do you mean to say that due to covid-19 pandemic lam onlytopay a 350 usd
05/02/24, 11:27 am - Garima Edoofa: Yes correct for the enrollment process.
05/02/24, 11:27 am - +263 78 988 8134: Yeah ofcourse it is true
05/02/24, 11:27 am - Garima Edoofa: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
05/02/24, 11:27 am - Garima Edoofa: @263789888134 basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
05/02/24, 11:27 am - +263 78 988 8134: Oky
05/02/24, 11:27 am - Garima Edoofa: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
05/02/24, 11:27 am - +263 78 988 8134: Oky
05/02/24, 11:33 am - +263 77 342 2069: Nice
05/02/24, 11:33 am - +263 78 988 8134: Okay and this is way much better and even makes it easier for parents to raise the money
05/02/24, 11:34 am - +263 78 988 8134: Pertaining this which Phase am l to indulge ini
05/02/24, 11:45 am - Garima Edoofa: Yes, indeed.
05/02/24, 11:45 am - Garima Edoofa: @263789888134 , as we have discussed about the payment policy of the Enrollment fee and other finances of the program as well, so can you share with me what all did you understand about the financial aspect of the program and how Edoofa helps a student arrange and pay his finances all by himself (in 80 to 100 words)?
05/02/24, 11:58 am - +263 78 988 8134: Okay so pertaining the financial aspect of the program Edoofa l have understood that the Edoofa program helps in offering a percentage discount on children's university fee as it pays the part payment of the children's fee and makes it easier for students to study at an affordable price and also as for the enrollment fee the Edoofa program also does the same and lowers the fee due to the covid-19 pandemic and also gives a suitable time for part payment of about 200 usd which is payed in seven days out of the 350usd. Nevertheless the Edoofa program also have the EWYL program which enables  a student to pay his finances on himself as one is offered a schoolarships credit
05/02/24, 12:07 pm - Garima Edoofa: Let me summarize the financial aspects for you
*Enrollment fee*
The enrollment fee is $350 out of which you need to pay only $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 is to be paid in next 30 days 
 
For all the services and assistance including Applications,SOP,Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection, and sessions etc all you need to pay is $350
 
 
*Cost of education*
The cost of education is reduced from $6000-$8000 to $2000-$3000 per annum which includes Tuition fee,Accommodation,Food,Wifi,Laundry,Library,Gym fee etc!
 
This cost can be further reduced through the earnings from Earn While You Learn program.
05/02/24, 12:08 pm - Garima Edoofa: I hope now you are clear?
05/02/24, 12:10 pm - +263 78 988 8134: Yes l now have the clear understand thank you
05/02/24, 12:13 pm - Garima Edoofa: Yes @263789888134 and I hope that you have understood how it totally depends upon the student to make his/her higher education affordable with the help of the Earn While You Learn Program's Scholarship Credits?
05/02/24, 12:24 pm - +263 78 988 8134: This message was deleted
05/02/24, 12:24 pm - +263 78 988 8134: Yes l have understood everything on that ma'am
05/02/24, 12:28 pm - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
05/02/24, 12:28 pm - Garima Edoofa: Let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
05/02/24, 12:28 pm - Garima Edoofa: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zimbabwe itself.
05/02/24, 12:29 pm - Garima Edoofa: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
05/02/24, 12:34 pm - +263 78 988 8134: Understood ma'am
05/02/24, 12:34 pm - Garima Edoofa: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that 
particular University chosen by you.
05/02/24, 12:35 pm - Garima Edoofa: Basically, this registration fee of ($500-$1000) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 instalments*. The first part will be paid in Coming few months of (2024-2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).

*After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
05/02/24, 12:35 pm - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
05/02/24, 12:35 pm - Garima Edoofa: So now would you like to ask anything?
05/02/24, 12:37 pm - +263 78 988 8134: Yes l would like to ask about the admission fee which you have stated to be 350 ,at which stage will l pay that amount
05/02/24, 12:38 pm - +263 78 988 8134: And also pertaining visa processing will Edoofa also cater for my visa processing finance or it will also work half and half with my parents
05/02/24, 12:38 pm - +263 78 988 8134: This is understandable
05/02/24, 12:39 pm - +263 78 988 8134: Does this mean that paying the registration fee will be part of my school fees
05/02/24, 12:39 pm - Garima Edoofa: Please refer to this message, the enrollment fee is $350, and once you clear the eligibility check interview with our Program Director, then the tentative dates will be shared with you to pay the enrollment fees.
05/02/24, 12:40 pm - +263 78 988 8134: Okay okay l get it
05/02/24, 12:44 pm - Garima Edoofa: If you understand the concept of International Education, the finances that play a major role are not visa fees or flight tickets because visa fee is given once in the whole program and the flight ticket is taken a limited number of times, maybe twice or once, because international students don't often travel back to their country.

They look forward to settling down and making sure education is not hampered. So they learn and do internships at breaks. But still, students can definitely visit their family during holidays and spend time with them.

But I personally have seen that students don't travel often, so considering the travel fee
*(air fare :-around $400,Visa fee:-$83) is to be borne by the student* which is mostly a one time investment.
05/02/24, 12:44 pm - Garima Edoofa: And hence our admission's team will provide all the assistance for the visa.
05/02/24, 12:45 pm - Garima Edoofa: This registration fee of $500 to $1000 is to be paid by the student/parent to reserve their scholarship seat with the university and it is not an additional cost, it is part of your first-year tuition fee which is paid while you are in your home country and it will be adjusted against yourfirst-yearr cost of education hence making your registration fee as zero.

I hope we are clear here?
05/02/24, 12:52 pm - +263 78 988 8134: Okay okay have understood
05/02/24, 12:52 pm - +263 78 988 8134: Yes we are now clear maam
05/02/24, 1:07 pm - Garima Edoofa: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
05/02/24, 1:07 pm - Garima Edoofa: Mrs.Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)
05/02/24, 1:07 pm - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
05/02/24, 1:07 pm - Garima Edoofa: Do connect Mrs. Ruth with our parents as well Tadiwanashe.
05/02/24, 1:08 pm - Garima Edoofa: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
05/02/24, 1:08 pm - Garima Edoofa: And for any questions apart from whatever we have explained, I would appreciate it if you refer your family to the FAQ document which has all the answers to most of the queries which generally parents have.
05/02/24, 1:08 pm - Garima Edoofa: Also, have a look at some pictures of the students who came to India recently for their Academic Session.

As a single parent of two daughters and a small-scale farmer, how did she successfully manage her responsibilities? Additionally, how did Edoofa assist her in overcoming any challenges she encountered, and what was her experience throughout the process?
06/02/24, 9:22 am - +263 78 988 8134: Yes we have managed to get in touch with her she made me understand some of the things l wasn't sure of for example the issue of the earn while learning programs she enlightened me by saying that the program act as points not that l will be receiving money and also she encouraged me to follow all your instructions as she has no problem with the Edoofa program as it has enabled her to handle the education of her children..... She even told me her experience throughout the process by saying that the Edoofa process isn't that tough  to encounter it is easy only if one follows the given instructions by the counselor which gave me motivation to over trust in Edoofa as it will change my world into a successful one

Mrs. Ruth's experience with Edoofa is a testament to the transformative impact our programs can have. She not only managed her family's needs but also seized the opportunity for her daughters to achieve higher education. The support and guidance she received from Edoofa were instrumental in her success.
The process was challenging, yet incredibly rewarding. Mrs. Ruth's determination, combined with Edoofa's assistance, has paved the way for a brighter future .

I would like to ask you a few questions, but before that with immense pleasure, I would like to share the glimpses of the Africa Visit of our Founders which took place in June 2023! 

It was a much-awaited event and they were welcomed by Ministries, Educationalists, Edoofians, and Parents across different African Countries. This is a must-watch video depicting the Acceptance of the Program in the African Continent, especially in Zimbabwe!
06/02/24, 9:38 am - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
06/02/24, 9:38 am - Garima Edoofa: In the mean time can you please answer these questions.
06/02/24, 9:38 am - Garima Edoofa: Can you tell me:-

1. What is the name of the course which you would be studying through the Edoofa Program?

2. What is the country finalized for your higher education?

3. What is the average cost for studies in India without a scholarship?

4. What is the annual fee you will pay if found eligible for the program?

5. What is the enrollment fee of the Edoofa Program? 

6. If you are found eligible for the program in how many days you will have to pay the first part of your enrollment fee?

7. After receiving your offer letter from the University, you will have to pay your registration fee to finalize your university selection and reserve your scholarship seat in a particular university, this registration fee would be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?
06/02/24, 9:54 am - +263 78 988 8134: 1. I would be study Bachelor of Arts in legislative law

2. India

3. The range is from 6000 to 8000

4.anual fee l will pay after found eligible for the program will be ranging from 2000 to 3000 usd

5. Enrollment fee is 350 usd

06/02/24, 9:56 am - +263 78 988 8134: Still downloading
06/02/24, 10:00 am - Garima Edoofa: Are your parents ready for the same?
06/02/24, 10:01 am - +263 78 988 8134: Yes l am sure they are ready
06/02/24, 10:03 am - +263 77 532 1563: Yes we are ready ma'am
06/02/24, 10:03 am - Garima Edoofa: I would want you to acknowledge the same using a voice note, please.
06/02/24, 10:04 am - +263 77 532 1563: <Media omitted>
06/02/24, 10:05 am - Garima Edoofa: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
06/02/24, 10:05 am - Garima Edoofa: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
06/02/24, 10:05 am - Garima Edoofa: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.
06/02/24, 10:05 am - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
06/02/24, 10:06 am - Garima Edoofa: Ideally as you know, the tentative dates:
1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 13th or 14th February  2024 for $200 and the 13th or 14th of march  for the remaining $150.
2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 13th or 14th February 2024. Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?
06/02/24, 10:10 am - +263 77 532 1563: That's true that we are going through
