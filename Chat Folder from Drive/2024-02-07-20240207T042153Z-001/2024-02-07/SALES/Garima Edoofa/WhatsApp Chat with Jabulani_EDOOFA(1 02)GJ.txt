02/02/24, 12:43 pm - Garima Edoofa: While there isn't a distinct degree dedicated solely to 'Social Work,' it is primarily a profession or vocational pursuit. Aspiring social workers can embark on this path with a diverse range of academic backgrounds. Nevertheless, when considering the initial steps toward a career in social work, it is customary for students to opt for degrees in fields such as Sociology or Law. May I know what intrigues you more, please?

02/02/24, 1:34 pm - +263 78 077 1448: Well I chose law because I feel like there are people who are serving long sentences for crimes they didn't commit mainly because no one is standing up for them to make sure that there isn't a miscarriage of Justice. I want to stand up for those people.
02/02/24, 2:15 pm - Garima Edoofa: That is great to know, May I know anyone in your family who has pursued this course?
02/02/24, 2:23 pm - +263 78 077 1448: I'm actually the first one, no one in my family has ever attempted to study law
02/02/24, 2:26 pm - Garima Edoofa: Alright! So going through your results which you've shared, I would recommend a course for you by analysis of your hobbies passion and career inclination and my expertise so the course is

The main role of a legal advisor or legal counsellor is to offer legal advice and work, for organizations and the employees of the organization. Their services can be utilized by the Government, NGOs, other associations or large organizations.

*Required Skill-Set for BA LLB*
It is rightly said that learning is an on – going process and this holds true especially in the aspect of personal and professional development. Although an individual may possess certain skills they need to be improved and developed constantly. A few key skills that are of paramount importance in the field of law are:

*Team player skills*– Since a legal professional will deal with a lot of people therefore to be effective they need to bond with people. The art of getting work done and obtaining information though networking and working with people helps in attaining the objectives.
02/02/24, 3:29 pm - Garima Edoofa: I would want you to go through the course and understand it and inform me once done.
02/02/24, 3:40 pm - +263 78 077 1448: I'm done, thank you so much for opening my mind
02/02/24, 3:40 pm - Garima Edoofa: May I know if this course aligns with you?

02/02/24, 3:44 pm - Garima Edoofa: Since you have understood the course properly.

02/02/24, 3:49 pm - Garima Edoofa: I appreciate and admire your foresightedness at the same time, Jabulani

However, as your concierge, I would like to share with you that the career path which you have chosen ahead, will require a lot of hard work and dedication.

So are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way in order to transform your career dear?
02/02/24, 3:53 pm - +263 78 077 1448: Absolutely, I am more than willing to give my all for that career
02/02/24, 3:55 pm - Garima Edoofa: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
02/02/24, 4:01 pm - +263 78 077 1448: I want to study abroad because I feel like there is more to explore about the program outside Zimbabwe plus by studying outside Zimbabwe my skills will be unique unlike other lawyers who studied in Zim. In addition to that, with the financial difficulties in Zimbabwe I can never find a Scholarship to study in Zim. So studying abroad is advantageous because there are scholarships like Edoofa which are willing to help students study abroad
02/02/24, 4:29 pm - Garima Edoofa: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, me that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
02/02/24, 4:45 pm - +263 78 077 1448: I am going to cross pollinate ideas from abroad to my mother country so that the legislative system can be more advanced
02/02/24, 5:39 pm - Garima Edoofa: I appreciate your sense of hardwork for your community Jabulani, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?
02/02/24, 5:54 pm - Garima Edoofa: I was expecting your response in the counselling session, but you could not get back to me due to some reason so I am about to finish my second counselling slot for the day, I will have to schedule your session for *Tomorrow at 9:30 AM CAT.*

Please note that I have two counseling slots in a day which are during my working hours from *9:00 am to 4:30 pm on Monday to Friday, and from 9:00 am to 1:00 pm* on Saturday so to complete your application you would have to be present during the time.

03/02/24, 10:26 am - Garima Edoofa: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
03/02/24, 10:30 am - +263 78 077 1448: Yes that's true

03/02/24, 11:14 am - +263 78 077 1448: Wow that's marvellous
03/02/24, 11:16 am - Garima Edoofa: Okay well Jabulani, since you have understood all the reasons properly as well, can you now tell me:-

1)How would studying in India have a positive impact on your career?

2)How do you aim to achieve your career aspirations from studying in India?
03/02/24, 11:31 am - +263 78 077 1448: Studying in India has a positive impact on my career because India as a country is highly valued in terms of education world wide and in that case my degree will be highly honoured wherever I go seeking employment worldwide. In addition, I have an opportunity of making money too since there are quite a number of current billionaires who studied in India

2) I think being a lawyer who studied in India can give me an upper hand when dealing with cases since it is top rated in terms of high quality education
03/02/24, 11:41 am - Garima Edoofa: That is remarkable, Jabulani. I see that you understand the quality of higher education that Edoofa seeks to deliver to its students so that after completing the education, the student is capable of achieving their career goals and having a prosperous career ahead of them.

Okay, so are you or any of your family members aware of the expense of a comparable quality higher education for an international student without a scholarship in India?
03/02/24, 11:41 am - +263 78 077 1448: No we got no idea about that
03/02/24, 11:46 am - Garima Edoofa: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is *around 6000-8000 USD. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from USD 15000 to USD 35000. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 6-year degree ranging from USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000*.

Now as we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with over 250+ Universities for the last 14 + years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 5 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
03/02/24, 11:46 am - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
03/02/24, 11:47 am - Garima Edoofa: So, don't you think it is affordable for your family?
03/02/24, 11:52 am - +263 78 077 1448: To be honest, as an orphan I'm not sure if my Guardian will afford that because he is also burdened by University fees of his children who are studying in South Africa, that will make it difficult for him to raise that amount for me. Thats the reason why I had looked for a scholarship, so that I can achieve my dreams despite the financial difficulties I am facing. Plus I had favoured the Earn while you learn program because I am a hard worker and thats the only way I can pay my fees. I hope you understand my situation
03/02/24, 12:48 pm - Garima Edoofa: I understand, please.
03/02/24, 12:48 pm - Garima Edoofa: This message was deleted
03/02/24, 12:48 pm - Garima Edoofa: In simple words Jabulani, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
03/02/24, 12:49 pm - Garima Edoofa: However as per my experience, I can share with you that *if you are able to perform and clear all these criteria with a high passing grade, you would be eligible for higher quantum of Scholarship*, in which you will just have to pay a minimal fee of *$1200-$1800*, Which would cover your entire fees be it food, accommodation, Tuition etc.

What are your thoughts on the same?
03/02/24, 12:51 pm - +263 78 077 1448: I want to ask something, is that 2000 paid in full at the same time
03/02/24, 1:18 pm - Garima Edoofa: @263780771448 I wish to communicate that I have apprised you of the spectrum of tuition fees. If you successfully pass the eligibility check interview with our program director during subsequent sessions, our admission team will guide and support you. Regarding your inquiry, it is possible to pay the tuition fee through installment payments.
03/02/24, 1:51 pm - +263 78 077 1448: That would be great, at least its affordable
03/02/24, 1:51 pm - +263 78 077 1448: I now understand you.
03/02/24, 1:53 pm - Garima Edoofa: Yes, please.
03/02/24, 1:54 pm - Garima Edoofa: Shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program?
03/02/24, 1:55 pm - +263 78 077 1448: Ok that sounds great
03/02/24, 1:56 pm - +263 78 077 1448: Yes go ahead
03/02/24, 1:58 pm - Garima Edoofa: The Earn While You Learn Program or the *EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program*. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
03/02/24, 1:58 pm - Garima Edoofa: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.


1. *Projects with Brands and Companies*: -

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0

-Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
03/02/24, 1:58 pm - Garima Edoofa: 2. *Recruitment Partners*: -

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
03/02/24, 1:58 pm - Garima Edoofa: 3. *Webinars*: -

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi
How to be industry ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu
It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje
Decoding the science of personal branding by Mr, Simon Maingi
03/02/24, 1:58 pm - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
03/02/24, 1:58 pm - Garima Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases. 

What are your views on the same? Do you think this will be benefiting you?
03/02/24, 2:04 pm - +263 78 077 1448: Absolutely, it will yield great benefits for me
03/02/24, 2:04 pm - Garima Edoofa: That is great to know, so now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food, and accommodation*, which means for the monthly family cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
03/02/24, 2:04 pm - Garima Edoofa: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

03/02/24, 2:11 pm - +263 78 077 1448: This is exactly what I had been looking for
03/02/24, 2:16 pm - Garima Edoofa: Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :

1.*Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*​: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses,which is completely waived off.
 
2.*Employability through practical training*​: We believe Students shouldn't just learn in theory, they should gain real-world experience instead of academic theory. That is why we help them by designing a practical employment oriented curriculum that helps students pick up job skills needed to be employable.
 
 
3.*Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing and involving. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What’s more, students earn scholarship credits in the process, thereby further reducing the burden of the cost of their education.
 
 
4.*Higher Education Concierge*​: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.
03/02/24, 2:16 pm - Garima Edoofa: So, after looking over the facts that distinguish Edoofa, which of the four points did you appreciate the most?
03/02/24, 2:22 pm - +263 78 077 1448: To be honest I appreciate all of them, especially the higher education concierge
03/02/24, 2:24 pm - Garima Edoofa: I am delighted to know that you have been looking for the same.


Alright Jabulani, basically, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
03/02/24, 2:25 pm - +263 78 077 1448: That's true
03/02/24, 2:32 pm - Garima Edoofa: Alright @263780771448 , basically once we complete your counseling session I would give you time to properly discuss about your entire application once again with your family members so that they too could have much better clarity regarding the same. Meanwhile, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
03/02/24, 2:39 pm - +263 78 077 1448: Yeah I am
03/02/24, 2:39 pm - +263 78 077 1448: The network is poor this side but I'm online
03/02/24, 2:40 pm - +263 78 077 1448: If u notice any delays its the network
03/02/24, 2:48 pm - Garima Edoofa: Alright, please.
03/02/24, 2:48 pm - Garima Edoofa: @263780771448 as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
03/02/24, 2:52 pm - +263 78 077 1448: Roughly around $1500 to $2250
03/02/24, 2:52 pm - Garima Edoofa: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
03/02/24, 2:53 pm - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
03/02/24, 2:53 pm - Garima Edoofa: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
03/02/24, 2:53 pm - Garima Edoofa: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education.

Don’t you think so?
03/02/24, 2:54 pm - +263 78 077 1448: That makes sense
03/02/24, 2:54 pm - Garima Edoofa: Can you please answer this question?
03/02/24, 2:57 pm - +263 78 077 1448: That's affordable indeed
03/02/24, 2:57 pm - +263 78 077 1448: Edoofa is a guardian engel indeed
03/02/24, 2:58 pm - Garima Edoofa: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
03/02/24, 2:58 pm - Garima Edoofa: Jabulani basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
03/02/24, 2:59 pm - Garima Edoofa: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
03/02/24, 3:04 pm - +263 78 077 1448: I do
03/02/24, 3:06 pm - Garima Edoofa: Jabulani, as we have discussed the payment policy of the Enrollment fee and other finances of the program as well, so can you share with me what you understand about the financial aspect of the program and how Edoofa helps a student arrange and pay his finances all by himself (in 80 to 100 words)?
03/02/24, 3:10 pm - +263 78 077 1448: Ok
03/02/24, 3:11 pm - Garima Edoofa: Yes, please.
03/02/24, 3:12 pm - +263 78 077 1448: That's fair enough
03/02/24, 3:14 pm - Garima Edoofa: Can you please answer this question?
03/02/24, 3:16 pm - +263 78 077 1448: This is good
03/02/24, 3:16 pm - +263 78 077 1448: Edoofa lowers the application fee from $1500 to $2250 and makes it affordable, thats $350 and this guarantee the student admission. If it happens that the student's results fail to meet the required range then it can be refunded. Students partake in the Earn While You Learn program whereby they are given online projects which can fuel up their chances of even contributing to their own fees, thus lessening the financial burden on the parents of paying fees
03/02/24, 3:22 pm - Garima Edoofa: Let me summarize the financial aspects for you
*Enrollment fee*
The enrollment fee is $350 out of which you need to pay only $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 is to be paid in next 30 days 
 
For all the services and assistance including Applications,SOP,Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection, and sessions etc all you need to pay is $350
 
 
*Cost of education*
The cost of education is reduced from $6000-$8000 to $2000-$3000 per annum which includes Tuition fee,Accommodation,Food,Wifi,Laundry,Library,Gym fee etc!
 
This cost can be further reduced through the earnings from Earn While You Learn program.
03/02/24, 3:22 pm - Garima Edoofa: I hope now you are clear?
03/02/24, 3:26 pm - +263 78 077 1448: Ok thanks for for the elaboration
03/02/24, 3:27 pm - +263 78 077 1448: Yes I am
03/02/24, 3:28 pm - Garima Edoofa: Yes Jabulani and I hope that you have understood how it totally depends upon the student to make his/her higher education affordable with the help of the Earn While You Learn Program's Scholarship Credits?
03/02/24, 3:37 pm - +263 78 077 1448: Yes I have understood
03/02/24, 3:38 pm - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
03/02/24, 3:38 pm - Garima Edoofa: Let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
03/02/24, 3:38 pm - Garima Edoofa: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zimbabwe itself.
03/02/24, 3:38 pm - Garima Edoofa: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
03/02/24, 3:44 pm - +263 78 077 1448: Please forgive me, the network is becoming worse
03/02/24, 3:45 pm - Garima Edoofa: I understand, please.
03/02/24, 3:45 pm - Garima Edoofa: May I know if you have gone through this?
03/02/24, 3:48 pm - +263 78 077 1448: Absolutely
03/02/24, 3:49 pm - Garima Edoofa: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that 
particular University chosen by you.
03/02/24, 3:49 pm - Garima Edoofa: Basically, this registration fee of ($500-$1000) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 instalments*. The first part will be paid in Coming few months of (2024-2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).

*After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
03/02/24, 3:49 pm - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
03/02/24, 3:49 pm - Garima Edoofa: So now would you like to ask anything?
03/02/24, 3:56 pm - +263 78 077 1448: Yes so does it mean that if I pay the registration fee, I will be enrolled and allowed to learn while the balance is yet to be paid, in two months time as you said
03/02/24, 3:58 pm - Garima Edoofa: Let me help you understand. This registration fee of $500 to $1000 is to be paid by the student/parent to reserve their scholarship seat with the university and it is not an additional cost, it is part of your first-year tuition fee which is paid while you are in your home country and it will be adjusted against your first-year cost of education hence making your registration fee as zero.

I hope we are clear here?
03/02/24, 4:02 pm - +263 78 077 1448: Ok ok I get the sense
03/02/24, 4:03 pm - Garima Edoofa: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
03/02/24, 4:03 pm - Garima Edoofa: Mrs.Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)
03/02/24, 4:03 pm - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
03/02/24, 4:03 pm - Garima Edoofa: Do connect Mrs. Ruth with your guardian as well Jabulani.
03/02/24, 4:03 pm - Garima Edoofa: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
03/02/24, 4:03 pm - Garima Edoofa: And for any questions apart from whatever we have explained, I would appreciate it if you refer your family to the FAQ document which has all the answers to most of the queries which generally parents have.
03/02/24, 4:03 pm - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
03/02/24, 4:03 pm - Garima Edoofa: Also, have a look at some pictures of the students who came to India recently for their Academic Session.

03/02/24, 4:04 pm - Garima Edoofa: Dear Jabulani,

Your scholarship journey is reaching a crucial juncture. *Monday on “05-02-24” at 10:00 AM CAT,* I will meticulously evaluate your application. This session is not just about answering your questions; it includes a vital Eligibility Check Interview.

We strongly recommend parents/guardians join, recognizing that higher education is a family decision. Prepare for a series of interviews, marking a significant phase in finalizing your scholarship application. As your counselor, I wish you the very best. It's been a pleasure guiding you through your career sessions.

If you qualify for the interview, *Senior Career Counselor Mr Sahil would be getting in touch*, we look forward to welcoming you to India. Please be proactive, as everyone's time is valuable. The Senior Counselor and Director will make decisions based on your interview and adhere strictly to the given time. Follow instructions diligently, and if the session is completed within the allotted time, your application will proceed.

Happy Family Discussion!
Stay Blessed!

As a single parent of two daughters and a small-scale farmer, how did she successfully manage her responsibilities? Additionally, how did Edoofa assist her in overcoming any challenges she encountered, and what was her experience throughout the process? <This message was edited>
05/02/24, 10:12 am - +263 78 077 1448: I texted her but the network was down during the weekend. I'm sure will respond today

05/02/24, 10:36 am - Garima Edoofa: You see, her story is truly remarkable. As a single parent, juggling the responsibilities of a small-scale farmer and the mother of two daughters, she has persevered. Her journey with Edoofa is a testament to how dedicated individuals can overcome obstacles.
Mrs. Ruth's experience with Edoofa is a testament to the transformative impact our programs can have. She not only managed her family's needs but also seized the opportunity for her daughters to achieve higher education. The support and guidance she received from Edoofa were instrumental in her success.
The process was challenging, yet incredibly rewarding. Mrs. Ruth's determination, combined with Edoofa's assistance, has paved the way for a brighter future .

05/02/24, 11:02 am - Garima Edoofa: Okay so in that case, @263780771448   
I would like to ask you a few questions, but before that with immense pleasure, I would like to share the glimpses of the Africa Visit of our Founders which took place in June 2023! 

It was a much-awaited event and they were welcomed by Ministries, Educationalists, Edoofians, and Parents across different African Countries. This is a must-watch video depicting the Acceptance of the Program in the African Continent, especially in Zimbabwe!

Are you clear about the same?

06/02/24, 8:49 am - Garima Edoofa: Good Morning @263780771448 @263713556557 , Hope you are doing well.

I am here to continue with our session, shall we start?
06/02/24, 11:56 am - +263 78 077 1448: Yes we may start
06/02/24, 11:56 am - +263 78 077 1448: Good morning to you too
06/02/24, 12:04 pm - Garima Edoofa: Can your Guardian, please answer this question?
06/02/24, 12:06 pm - +263 71 355 6557: <Media omitted>
06/02/24, 12:07 pm - Garima Edoofa: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
06/02/24, 12:07 pm - Garima Edoofa: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
06/02/24, 12:07 pm - Garima Edoofa: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.
06/02/24, 12:07 pm - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
06/02/24, 12:08 pm - Garima Edoofa: Ideally as you know, the tentative dates:
1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 13th or 14th February  2024 for $200 and the 13th or 14th of march  for the remaining $150.
2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 13th or 14th February 2024. Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?

06/02/24, 12:17 pm - +263 71 355 6557: <Media omitted>
06/02/24, 12:20 pm - Garima Edoofa: @263780771448 @263713556557  since you have answered all the questions, now a video call will be scheduled with the Program Director, once I submit the evaluation report of Jabulani's application. 

Shall I get you the slots for tomorrow and may I know at what time you are available for the same?
06/02/24, 12:21 pm - +263 71 355 6557: <Media omitted>
06/02/24, 12:25 pm - Garima Edoofa: Parents and Students Your interview has been scheduled for 10:00 AM CAT time tomorrow . Please set an alarm to ensure you're available at least 10 minutes before the call. Also, make the necessary preparations for a video call. Please note that the director will only conduct the interview once, and missing it may lead to application cancellation. Best of luck!
