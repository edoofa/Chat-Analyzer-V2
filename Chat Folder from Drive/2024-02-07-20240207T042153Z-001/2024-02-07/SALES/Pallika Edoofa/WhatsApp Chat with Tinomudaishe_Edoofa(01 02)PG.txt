01/02/24, 2:35 pm - +263 78 810 0698: OK I will keep on research
01/02/24, 2:38 pm - +263 78 810 0698: Like you said before that I will be an international student it will help  me to be accepted in many counties when looking for an employment it will be very easy to get the job where ever I go Furthermore to study in India is good because of your programme which allow student to earn while studying
01/02/24, 2:42 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Thank you for highlighting the benefits of being an international student and the advantages of studying in India, especially through programs like Edoofa that offer opportunities to earn while studying. Your insights underscore the value of global education and its impact on future employment prospects.
01/02/24, 2:42 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Also,  I can see, you have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead.

*By any chance are you familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship?*
01/02/24, 2:42 pm - +263 78 810 0698: You are welcome
01/02/24, 2:42 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Please address this
01/02/24, 2:44 pm - +263 78 810 0698: No I can't afford without scholarship
01/02/24, 2:44 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That’s alright, Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India compared to other global hubs.

In India, international students face an average expense of *$6000-$8000 annually.* While this is very low as compared to the Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc where the cost of education ranges from $15000-$35000 annually, it is still beyond the reach of many.

With the Edoofa Scholarship Program, the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000 per annum* for the students who are found eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility Check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Laundry, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
01/02/24, 2:45 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
01/02/24, 2:45 pm - Pallika Edoofa: In simple words what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost $3000 or less a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well. 

However, as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even after this we allow the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.

*So do you feel the reduced cost of education is affordable to your family?*
01/02/24, 2:46 pm - +263 78 810 0698: Yes is affordable
01/02/24, 2:46 pm - +263 78 810 0698: May I know about travelling expenses and visa applications you help or
01/02/24, 2:48 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Good to know, 
So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians. Looking at this cost of education as well, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits which can help in reducing their fees further.

Do you know how that is done?
01/02/24, 3:18 pm - +263 78 810 0698: May you explain further
01/02/24, 3:22 pm - Pallika Edoofa: sure
01/02/24, 3:22 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That’s alright, Let me tell you how Edoofa helps Edoofians bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the *Earn While You Learn Program*

The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that are equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.The Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies and needs, converting an Individual into a market-ready professional. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
01/02/24, 3:22 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Projects with Brands and Companies: -*
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, such as:
*Africa Global Radio-* The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project and hear from the CEO about the exposures of the Edoofa program.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0
*Skooqs-* This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

*Recruitment Partners:-*
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

*Webinars:-*
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars regularly with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
-Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
-How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi
-How to be industry-ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu
-It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje
-Decoding the science of personal branding by Mr, Simon Maingi
01/02/24, 3:22 pm - Pallika Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field. These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.

*What are your views on the same? Do you think you will be benefiting from the Earn While You Learn Program?*
01/02/24, 3:55 pm - +263 78 810 0698: I will benefit because it will be better for paying tuition fee through that program  its have many benefits I support it
01/02/24, 3:56 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
01/02/24, 3:56 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Absolutely,
If I have to help you explain how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable compared to Local Universities, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now, if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, bringing the cost further down to $1000 per year including the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month. *This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*

*You can see this even in this scholarship credit certificate where one of our star performers, our Proud Edoodians  Masinire Miriam earned $1965 within a year.* I hope you can now realize the power of the EWYL program to reduce the financial pressure on families.
01/02/24, 3:58 pm - +263 78 810 0698: I really understand it it is useful to a greater extent
01/02/24, 3:58 pm - +263 78 810 0698: May I know about traveling expenses from my origin to India you help pr
01/02/24, 3:59 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Tinomudaishe, not visa fees and flight tickets. The flight ticket is required a very limited number of times as the students don't travel that often. I don't mean to say that students can not go back to their country, they can definitely go back to enjoy the holidays. What I have personally seen is, the students do not travel that often.

So, considering the main finance which plays the most important role in international education is the annual fees. So, to reduce this annual fee, Edoofa helps a student with the Earn While You Learn Program. This program provides the students with an opportunity to earn scholarship credits which in return help them to make their education more affordable.

Visa fees and flight tickets are to be bought just a month before they plan to come to India. So, let's say the student wants to come to India in August 2024, This means that his family has to cater the Visa fee and the ticket in July 2024. If you understand the concept properly, till July 2024, the student will be working in the Earn While You Learn program and will be earning Scholarship credits. Now, with this opportunity, you can save a lot of money on the annual fee which in return helps you to make your flight ticket and the Visa fee affordable.

As mentioned to you already, the scholarship covers the tuition fees as you see, the Edoofa scholarship is basically the scholarship seats acquired from the universities for their good work in the past 14 years in the higher education space. So the travel costs will have to be covered by the student, But our admission team assist you in all the steps. So that you get the cheapest air travel tickets and also easily acquire the visa.

The cost of the visa is $83 for the entire course, and the flight cost will be around $400 to $500. But you need not worry about that yet as you will be coming to India in the month of July-August and till them the team would be helping you with your preparations.
01/02/24, 4:02 pm - +263 78 810 0698: Olk OK sir/madam I really appreciate with your assistance I leant a lot through this discussion
01/02/24, 4:02 pm - Pallika Edoofa: You are most welcome, Tinomudaishe
01/02/24, 4:03 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Also, You can address me as Ms. Pallika
01/02/24, 4:03 pm - +263 78 810 0698: OK OK thanks
01/02/24, 4:03 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Great, As we are proceeding towards the end of the session, Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, a few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :

*1. Expert Career Counselling:* We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counsellors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.

*2. Affordability through guaranteed scholarships:* Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off.

*3. Earn While You Learn:* The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing our students for the real world. 

*4.Higher Education Concierge:* A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.*

After going through these facts that make Edoofa different, which one out of the 4 did you feel is the most significant?
01/02/24, 4:03 pm - +263 78 810 0698: May I know about time of  discussion starting from tomorrow onwards so that I will available online

01/02/24, 4:05 pm - Pallika Edoofa: As you see, there is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it depends upon his/her hard work. However, who will be helping you with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
01/02/24, 4:06 pm - +263 78 810 0698: My blood relatives uncle,  brother and biological father
01/02/24, 4:07 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That’s understandable,I believe you'll be discussing everything with your family after we complete today's session. Also, after our counselling session, I would connect to some of our beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know their experiences and proceedings well.

May I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
01/02/24, 4:09 pm - +263 78 810 0698: At first my mother discouraged me because of bad news she heard about studying abroad but later on my all relatives were exhilarated when I told them I'm in touch with Edoofa so they are so happy and they will be happy
01/02/24, 4:10 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Tinomudaishe, It's understandable that your mother initially had concerns about studying abroad, given the uncertainties and challenges often associated with it. However, it's heartwarming to hear that your relatives are now excited and supportive of your journey, especially with the assistance of Edoofa. Having the encouragement and happiness of your family behind you will undoubtedly be a source of strength and motivation as you pursue your educational goals.
01/02/24, 4:11 pm - Pallika Edoofa: May I know which bad news are you referring to?
01/02/24, 4:12 pm - +263 78 810 0698: Like rituals which are performed with those so-called agent like killing of people and using their organs even using them in dirty music and slavery
01/02/24, 4:14 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Tinomudaishe, I completely understand your concerns regarding the negative activities sometimes associated with agents. Rest assured, our organization has been deeply rooted in this field for over 14 years, fostering strong relationships and connections with reputable institutions and individuals. We prioritize the safety and well-being of our students above all else. Throughout your academic journey, we will be there to provide unwavering support and guidance. You can trust in our commitment to ensuring a secure and positive experience for every student
01/02/24, 4:15 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Also, Being a parent, the concern regarding the welfare and personal development of their child is absolutely understandable. 

To give a glimpse, we have a community of more than 2500 Zimbabweans with  300+ associate schools from Zimbabwe with a panel of Headmasters, teachers, and parents, who have been bringing success stories of Edoofians for the past 14+ years due to the kind of foster and care that we provide throughout their course!

With UGC-approved Universities whose degrees are Globally accredited, and which have all security and healthcare facilities including counselling departments, Edoofians are exposed to a conducive environment that motivates them to focus on their career and achieve their dreams. There are Zimbabwean Communities at Every University so no child will feel lonely. Moreover, our Admission Team, EWYL(Earn While You Learn) mentor and counsellor of a student will be available to him/her throughout the course. At any point, if the student or parent needs assistance we will be readily accessible. This is the reason why Edoofa is known as a *Higher Education Concierge!*

The Universities are strict in terms of the welfare of children. Being in Zimbabwe itself, your parents will be able to track the happenings, academic performance, and University details
01/02/24, 4:15 pm - +263 78 810 0698: But mom was happy when I told her that an agent that approached me is a Zimbabwean and I know the people of his clan

01/02/24, 4:16 pm - +263 78 810 0698: That's why I chose this programme because it's not a criminal programme and India is not a criminal country through my research
01/02/24, 4:17 pm - +263 78 810 0698: I will view it when I reach the WIFI now network is a challenge because of bad weather

01/02/24, 4:19 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright!
01/02/24, 4:19 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Also, *As we move to the last part of the session, let me highlight a few requirements while a student applies alone* 

*1) Application Form* -An online or offline form that asks for your personal details and academic background.

*2) Statement of Purpose-* An essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and your aspirations for your career.

*3) Letter of Recommendation-* from Senior authorities, School Heads or others on why they recommend you to be a right fit for an international university.
Do you know about other requirements?
01/02/24, 4:54 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
01/02/24, 6:17 pm - +263 78 810 0698: No I know those requirements only
01/02/24, 7:01 pm - +263 78 810 0698: Sorry network became a challenge because of precarious weather which had obliterated operations of electricity
02/02/24, 9:36 am - Pallika Edoofa: Greetings,

*"If you can dream it, you can do it."*

On this positive note, are we good to begin today's session?
02/02/24, 9:44 am - +263 78 810 0698: Morning Ms  Pallika
02/02/24, 9:45 am - +263 78 810 0698: Yeah but I will be busy at 11.00 am to 06.00 pm
02/02/24, 9:54 am - Pallika Edoofa: That's alright
02/02/24, 9:54 am - Pallika Edoofa: We will going to end our session!
02/02/24, 9:55 am - Pallika Edoofa: I hope that you have understood upto this, Continuing that please note, When a student applies alone for an international University, on average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose costs between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally and act as a major parameter to decide the child’s eligibility. If you apply to 5 Universities, the average costs for the mentioned would be $1350-$1750, *without even receiving a guarantee to be selected*

*Edoofa has identified a solution for this uncertainty and unaffordability.* If a student qualifies after the eligibility check, not only does Edoofa help them draft their statement of purpose but also helps in terms of Visa Documentation Assistance, University Session and selection, Individual mentorship, etc, reducing the costs significantly to $750 which is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
02/02/24, 9:55 am - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
02/02/24, 10:09 am - +263 78 810 0698: Yes inform me
02/02/24, 10:18 am - Pallika Edoofa: Sure
02/02/24, 10:18 am - Pallika Edoofa: The enrollment fee is to be paid only if a child is found eligible for the Edoofa Scholarship Program after passing the eligibility check stage, it includes, 

*Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
*Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
*Earn While You Learn Program and training*
*University sessions and selection*
*A guaranteed scholarship seat*
*Visa Documentation Assistance*
*The Foster and Care throughout the course of an Edoofian*
02/02/24, 10:18 am - Pallika Edoofa: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge due to which parents might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short period of 7 days and for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option wherein if the student is found eligible, instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, *parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days thereby reducing the financial pressure.*
02/02/24, 10:39 am - +263 78 810 0698: OK I get it so after this session there will be another session ?
02/02/24, 10:46 am - +263 78 810 0698: It's a good programme because parents take time to pay fees
02/02/24, 11:02 am - Pallika Edoofa: Tinomudaishe, Please note that as we end our today's session, your eligibility check test and interview will be scheduled and if you found eligible and gets enrolled your EWYL and Admission Process will be started!

So shall I explain them to you? <This message was edited>
02/02/24, 9:18 pm - +263 78 810 0698: Yeah explain them I'm ready for everything
02/02/24, 9:19 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright!
02/02/24, 9:19 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 5:* After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors. They will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. will be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by paying the registration fee within a few weeks.

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education and the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).
02/02/24, 9:19 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 6:* Once you are done with the registration fee payment, you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.
 
I hope you are clear with the process.
02/02/24, 9:20 pm - +263 78 810 0698: So I will pay registration fee while I'm in Zimbabwe
02/02/24, 9:21 pm - +263 78 810 0698: Yeah it's clear
02/02/24, 9:23 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Please note that The registration fee($500-$1000) is to be paid after you receive the Offer letter from University after the University sessions and then you receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. 

*The registration fee isn't an additional fee as it is waived off from the cost of education.*
 
For example, if your cost of education after the scholarship is $2200 per annum and the registration fee is $600, then while you are in India you need to pay only the remaining amount which is $2200-600= $1600
02/02/24, 9:24 pm - +263 78 810 0698: OK OK I get the point

Even though, the cost of education through the Edoofa Scholarship ranges from $2000-$3000 per annum, based on your performance in the eligibility check stage and evaluation of our Admissions team, you can be considered for a higher quantum of scholarship which can reduce the costs even below $2000 inclusive of tuition and living. <This message was edited>

04/02/24, 9:47 am - Pallika Edoofa: Good afternoon Tinomudaishe,
How are you doing today?
04/02/24, 11:18 am - +263 78 810 0698: I'm fine how are you too
05/02/24, 8:51 am - Pallika Edoofa: Good afternoon Everyone,
I hope that you all are doing well
05/02/24, 8:52 am - Pallika Edoofa: Kindly excuse for the delay as we were having a weekend!
05/02/24, 8:52 am - +263 78 810 0698: I'm absolutely good
05/02/24, 8:52 am - +263 78 810 0698: OK no problem we have patience
05/02/24, 8:53 am - Pallika Edoofa: Thank you for understanding!
05/02/24, 8:53 am - Pallika Edoofa: I had discussed everything with your father as well
05/02/24, 8:53 am - +263 78 810 0698: You are welcome
05/02/24, 8:53 am - +263 78 810 0698: OK so are you satisfied
05/02/24, 8:54 am - Pallika Edoofa: So, as to proceed, @263712291915 @263773367179 you see as per my experience over the last couple of years, I have been fortunate to have assisted over hundreds of students in achieving their career aspiration through the Edoofa Program. 

One of my key observations during helping out these students was regarding what was the common trait amongst students who are today having the best of their time in India through the Edoofa Program, and honestly I was able to come down to only one aspect that is FAMILY SUPPORT.
05/02/24, 8:54 am - Pallika Edoofa: You see in this journey of any child's higher education, there are three major contributors 

1. Student himself/herself
2. FAMILY
3. EDOOFA PROGAM

Now all the students who are today successfully a part of the Edoofa Program, had all these three contributors working together towards the common goal which is student's success and ensuring that by the time student completes his/her higher education they should be able to get good paying jobs. 

Even if any one of the contributor does not perform to the best of their abilities, Student's overall success is hampered. Let me give you a few examples

*In the event if student wishes to work hard, Edoofa is willing to support but the Family is not willing to support, the student will not be successful under the program*

*In the event if student wishes to work hard, Family is willing to support, but Edoofa's academic Board doesn't find the student worthy, the student will not be successful under the program*

*In the event if Family is willing to support, Edoofa's Academic Board is willing to support but the student doesn't wishes to work hard, then also the student will not be successful under the program*
05/02/24, 8:54 am - Pallika Edoofa: During the evaluation of your child's application so far, the Academic Board has evaluated a few aspects, such as student's willingness to work hard, and family's willingness to support the student so that the student can achieve what he/she has aspired. However now in your interview ahead, the Academic Board would be strictly be evaluating the Family's support towards the child higher education. 

*As you know in the event if your child is found eligible, you would have to complete a certain part of the formalities within the 7 day timeline, so may I know regarding the same, are you willing to support your child to the fullest?*

06/02/24, 2:27 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
06/02/24, 2:28 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I understand the network challenges, but  I do appreciate your understanding of the current circumstances with the large number of applicants and the restricted number of scholarship slots, particularly during this time when the A-level results are being announced. Given the significance of this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and the volume of applications we are presently receiving, it would be greatly appreciated if you could respond to be considered for a scholarship seat. 
*I believe you are a deserving candidate!*
06/02/24, 2:29 pm - +263 78 810 0698: That's so good
06/02/24, 2:30 pm - +263 78 810 0698: Yeah I know the current situations
06/02/24, 2:31 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Indeed!
06/02/24, 2:32 pm - Pallika Edoofa: So, Tinomudaishe, Please ask them and let me know when will I expect to hear from them so as I can schedule an interview for you!
06/02/24, 2:33 pm - +263 78 810 0698: Olk let me call them right now so that u will chat with them
