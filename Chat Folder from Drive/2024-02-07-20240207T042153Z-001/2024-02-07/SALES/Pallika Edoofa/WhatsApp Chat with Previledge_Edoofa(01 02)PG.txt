How are you doing?
01/02/24, 10:00 am - Pallika Edoofa: Ms. Blessing,  I will be guiding you through all the aspects of the Edoofa Program. However, just before we delve into that, I would like to get to know you better as a parent.

01/02/24, 11:30 am - Pallika Edoofa: *The Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4000 students from different African countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
01/02/24, 11:30 am - Pallika Edoofa: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program. We are associated with more than 200 schools in Zimbabwe with some of the most elite schools. In Harare, we collaborate with *St. Dominic’s Chishawasha, Dominican Convent High, Christ Ministries, Harare High, Mablereigh Girls High, St Ignatius, St John’s* and many others. To name a few from *Manicaland, St. David’s Girls Bonda, Hartzell High, First Class Academy, Chibuwe High, Nagle House* and so on with the children of the DEOs of Chipinge and Mutare having their children under the Edoofa Scholarship. Masvingo has 24 Schools that collaborated with over 300 students from some of the best schools such as *Pamushana, St. Antony’s, Reformed Church Gutu, Dewure High, Chiredzi High* and many others. The program is also appreciated by the Education Inspector of Bikita- Madam Makomeke. We have more than 500 students from Mashonaland (West, Central and East) Province, *Midlands Province(Fletcher, Regina Mundi, etc). Mathebeland(North, South) we have St Mark’s, Usher High, Plumtree, Sizane High etc.* Our collaborations with the UCE College Bulawayo add a feather to the Cap of trust that Edoofa has built in 14 years. 

The Schools, Institutions and Educationists who have made efforts to train the students for this prestigious Scholarship Program are also the Authorized Dignitaries of EDOOFA in Zimbabwe. *We have Mr. Shorwi Kawadza (Retd. Headmaster Hartzell), Mr. Charles Jerera (Retd. Ministry of Education), Mrs. Christina Rockson (Founder and Principal of Hilltop Christian College in SA)* who have shown relentless efforts to guide students on the right path to success.EDOOFA boasts a proud students and parents community of more than 2500+ Zimbabweans who are happy with the quality of education and the employability outcomes.

*I believe you are looking forward to such an opportunity for your child’s career, aren't you?*

01/02/24, 12:10 pm - +263 77 779 1633: Where are offices located in zimbabwe so that I can visit
01/02/24, 12:30 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Please note that we don't have an office in Zimbabwe since it would be challenging to set up an office in the 29+ countries from which we receive applications. The nearest office to you would be in Kitwe, Zambia. If you have known people in Zambia, I can guide you to visit our office. We have visits to Zimbabwe every year to prepare our Edoofians for their intake and since your child is studying in Harare, let me tell you that Harare is very close to us as our founders hosted Education summits last year as well as this year. We are associated with many schools in Harare, some of them are the Nation's best schools, including *St. Dominic’s Chishawasha, Dominican Convent High, Christ Ministries, Mablereigh Girls High, St Ignatius, St John's, Harare High, Advent Hope Academy etc*

01/02/24, 12:48 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Mrs Blessing, let me help you have a clarity here, 

1. Edoofa Scholarship Program doesn't have admission agents. Our associates are reputed educationists who are proud beneficiary of the program themselves. 
2. The purpose of this group is to evaluate Previledge's application and I am a Career Counsellor, who is conducting the counselling session over here, we have Head of Counselling and Head of Admissions present in this group for evaluation purposes. 
If you need contacts of our associates, surely towards the completion of the counselling session I would share the same so that you can have a word with them.

02/02/24, 4:29 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Thank you for sharing this, I would like to know what specific plans and preparations you and your parents have made for your tertiary education abroad?
02/02/24, 4:34 pm - +263 77 774 7127: We haven't made any preparations yet
02/02/24, 4:34 pm - +263 77 774 7127: Still waiting for my A level results
02/02/24, 4:35 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Please note that the Edoofa Scholarship offers 50-100% scholarship on the tuition fees and based on the performance and evaluations of our Academic Board, one can even achieve a higher quantum of the scholarship but the remaining cost after the scholarship such as Living and Transportation is catered by a student's family.  I will be guiding you through the financial aspects of the program.

Will they be able to manage the remaining expenses?
02/02/24, 4:36 pm - +263 77 774 7127: How much are the expenses

On this positive note, are we good to begin today's session?
03/02/24, 12:37 pm - +263 77 774 7127: Sure
03/02/24, 1:08 pm - Pallika Edoofa: How are you doing today
03/02/24, 1:11 pm - +263 77 774 7127: I'm doing great hope you are fine too
03/02/24, 1:11 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I am also doing well
03/02/24, 1:12 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Have you gone through the document?
03/02/24, 1:23 pm - +263 77 774 7127: Yh I did but its unfortunate that my parents can't afford the remaining expenses
03/02/24, 1:23 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I understand, But May I know the concern, please?
03/02/24, 1:34 pm - +263 77 774 7127: According to them it's just the same as studying in a university here in Zimbabwe because the fees and accommodation are just equal to the expenses they should take care of when I get admitted in an Indian university
03/02/24, 1:37 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Priviledge, I do understand the challenges, did you manage to compare the cost of education in Zimbabwe with that through the Edoofa Scholarship Program?
03/02/24, 1:37 pm - Pallika Edoofa: See, Being honest with you,  Our Senior Academician was in Zimbabwe for 4 months last year and let me highlight the importance of this opportunity for Zimbabwean students. I want you to think about this situation, where you are studying at UZ. The Tuition fee at UZ ranges from $1000-$1200 per annum with hikes most of the years. The living expenses in Zimbabwe are much more costly than in India. Even the staple diet sadza costs $1 per meal. So you have to spend around $3 per or more per day for meals. A taxi ride for a short distance costs $1, Wi-Fi costs $120 per month, the living rents are high with hikes and the unemployment rates are increasing. Many students work at petrol pumps, markets, selling SIM cards etc after graduation. You might have observed this. All in all, students studying in Zimbabwe have informed us they have to meet an expense of about $3000 or more per annum.
03/02/24, 1:37 pm - Pallika Edoofa: At the same time, Edoofians are studying here in India at a cost much less than that of Zimbabwe and even self-sponsoring their education through the Earn While You Learn Program. We also ensure they develop employability skills so that they are job-ready by the time they graduate. I believe you are looking forward to such an opportunity for your career, aren't you?
03/02/24, 1:38 pm - +263 77 774 7127: I really am
03/02/24, 1:40 pm - +263 77 774 7127: They did compare adding on the registration fee and transport
03/02/24, 10:14 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
05/02/24, 1:09 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Good Morning,

06/02/24, 10:29 am - Pallika Edoofa: So, may I know if they are willing to support you?
06/02/24, 11:48 am - +263 77 774 7127: Sure they have reconsidered and they are willing to support
06/02/24, 11:50 am - Pallika Edoofa: Will they be able to manage the remaining expenses?
06/02/24, 11:54 am - +263 77 774 7127: Surely they will try to
06/02/24, 11:58 am - Pallika Edoofa: ALright!
06/02/24, 11:59 am - Pallika Edoofa: I would like to know about the profession of your parents as well
06/02/24, 11:59 am - Pallika Edoofa: Also, Moving forward, please send your O level and term results with me, preferably in picture format for your academic evaluation.
