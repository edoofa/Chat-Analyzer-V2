You can go ahead
25/01/24, 1:28 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Please go through this and address this!
25/01/24, 1:48 pm - +263 78 066 7844: As a young student girl it is impactful to me because of the diverse rich cultural experience, quality education, affordable costs of education, diverse academic opportunities, global career prospects , network and connections , use of English language in teaching, research opportunities, exposure to mega diversity, Scholarships and financial assistance, and personal growth will help me to shape and achieve my goals
25/01/24, 1:49 pm - +263 78 066 7844: Also opportunity to learn one or two foreign languages eg Hind or French
25/01/24, 1:51 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Shannet, Your perspective on the impact of studying abroad is truly insightful and inspiring. The diverse cultural experience, quality education, and numerous academic opportunities available, coupled with the affordability and global career prospects, make it an enriching journey. The use of English as the teaching language, coupled with research opportunities and exposure to mega diversity, further enhances the experience.
25/01/24, 1:51 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *By any chance are you familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship?*
25/01/24, 2:00 pm - +263 78 066 7844: I was told without scholarships it ranges and varies with the university between $16000 and $3000 or slightly above
25/01/24, 2:05 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That’s alright, Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India compared to other global hubs.

In India, international students face an average expense of *$6000-$8000 annually.* While this is very low as compared to the Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc where the cost of education ranges from $15000-$35000 annually, it is still beyond the reach of many.

With the Edoofa Scholarship Program, the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000 per annum* for the students who are found eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility Check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Laundry, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
25/01/24, 2:05 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
25/01/24, 2:05 pm - Pallika Edoofa: In simple words what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost $3000 or less a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well. 

However, as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even after this we allow the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.

*So do you feel the reduced cost of education is affordable to your family?*
25/01/24, 2:10 pm - +263 78 066 7844: Yes it is affordable
25/01/24, 2:11 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Good to know, 
So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians. Looking at this cost of education as well, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits which can help in reducing their fees further.

Do you know how that is done?
25/01/24, 2:17 pm - +263 78 066 7844: No I don't know how it is done
25/01/24, 3:52 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for the delay as I was having my lunch!
25/01/24, 3:52 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That’s alright, Let me tell you how Edoofa helps Edoofians bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the *Earn While You Learn Program*

The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that are equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.The Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies and needs, converting an Individual into a market-ready professional. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
25/01/24, 3:52 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Projects with Brands and Companies: -*
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, such as:
*Africa Global Radio-* The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project and hear from the CEO about the exposures of the Edoofa program.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0
*Skooqs-* This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

*Recruitment Partners:-*
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

*Webinars:-*
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars regularly with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
-Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
-How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi
-How to be industry-ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu
-It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje
-Decoding the science of personal branding by Mr, Simon Maingi
25/01/24, 3:52 pm - Pallika Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field. These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.

*What are your views on the same? Do you think you will be benefiting from the Earn While You Learn Program?*
25/01/24, 4:18 pm - +263 78 066 7844: As for now I won't be ready for earn while learn program. May kindly use the other option of directly entry without having to go the EWYL program
25/01/24, 4:23 pm - Pallika Edoofa: May I know the reason?
25/01/24, 4:37 pm - +263 78 066 7844: Since I have stated before that my parents can afford the costs I would rather choose another option.
25/01/24, 5:10 pm - +263 78 066 7844: Takes time to have points accumulate and reduce quantum on the fees

Getting accepted letter will depend on student having paid up the required sum inclusive of EWYL points
26/01/24, 9:21 am - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
26/01/24, 9:26 am - +263 77 324 8242: Noted with thanks, Good morning.

Today it's Mr Chibura And her daughter Shannet's   birthday
26/01/24, 9:28 am - Pallika Edoofa: Good morning, Ms. Kerina!

26/01/24, 10:01 am - +263 77 224 4216: Thank you so much
26/01/24, 10:03 am - +263 78 066 7844: Thank you so much 🙏.I really do appreciate
29/01/24, 9:46 am - Pallika Edoofa: Greetings to you all,
As scheduled, I am here to continue your sessions and evaluate your application.
29/01/24, 9:48 am - +263 78 066 7844: Greetings to you too
29/01/24, 9:50 am - +263 77 324 8242: Fine thanks and how are you
29/01/24, 9:50 am - +263 77 324 8242: It's alright
29/01/24, 10:12 am - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Everyone!
29/01/24, 10:12 am - Pallika Edoofa: I hope that you are doing eell today and had a great weekend!
29/01/24, 10:13 am - Pallika Edoofa: Also, How did your birthday go? I hope that you have enjoyed that too!
29/01/24, 10:23 am - +263 78 066 7844: It was a great day.. I really enjoyed it
29/01/24, 10:28 am - Pallika Edoofa: Good to hear that!
29/01/24, 10:30 am - +263 77 324 8242: It was great needed
29/01/24, 10:30 am - Pallika Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your preferences regarding the financial aspect of studying abroad. It's commendable that your parents can afford the costs, and your desire to explore alternative options is understandable. The Earn While You Learn (EWYL) program sounds like a promising opportunity to gradually reduce the financial burden through point accumulation. However, participation in this program is entirely optional and ultimately up to the student's discretion. Whether you choose to participate or not, I'm confident that you'll make the best decision for your academic journey.
29/01/24, 10:30 am - Pallika Edoofa: So, continuing the discussion, Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, a few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :

*1. Expert Career Counselling:* We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counsellors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.

*2. Affordability through guaranteed scholarships:* Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off.

*3. Earn While You Learn:* The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing our students for the real world. 

*4.Higher Education Concierge:* A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.*

After going through these facts that make Edoofa different, which one out of the 4 did you feel is the most significant?
29/01/24, 10:31 am - Pallika Edoofa: That's great!
29/01/24, 10:48 am - +263 78 066 7844: 4
29/01/24, 10:53 am - Pallika Edoofa: Great! 
So now I know you focus more on quality education, services and guidance
Let me also show you some monthly earnings of students through Earn While You Learn.

29/01/24, 10:54 am - Pallika Edoofa: As you see, there is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it depends upon his/her hard work. However, who will be helping you with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
29/01/24, 10:59 am - +263 78 066 7844: My mom and daddy
29/01/24, 11:04 am - Pallika Edoofa: That’s understandable,I believe you'll be discussing everything with your family after we complete today's session. Also, after our counselling session, I would connect to some of our beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know their experiences and proceedings well.

May I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
29/01/24, 11:23 am - +263 77 324 8242: We feeling great honored and excited
29/01/24, 11:24 am - +263 77 224 4216: We feel excited
29/01/24, 11:29 am - Pallika Edoofa: Dear Parents, I am glad to hear that, studying Internationally would make your child’s career advance at an even greater pace, as your child will be transformed into a professional with a Greater Paying Job, which would help in uplifting your family and provide a hassle-free life.
29/01/24, 11:29 am - Pallika Edoofa: *As we move to the last part of the session, let me highlight a few requirements while a student applies alone* 

*1) Application Form* -An online or offline form that asks for your personal details and academic background.

*2) Statement of Purpose-* An essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and your aspirations for your career.

*3) Letter of Recommendation-* from Senior authorities, School Heads or others on why they recommend you to be a right fit for an international university.
Do you know about other requirements?
29/01/24, 11:30 am - +263 78 066 7844: The are excited
29/01/24, 11:33 am - +263 78 066 7844: They are excited
29/01/24, 11:35 am - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Shannet!
29/01/24, 11:35 am - Pallika Edoofa: I hope that you have gone through this!
29/01/24, 11:35 am - Pallika Edoofa: So,  When a student applies alone for an international University, on average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose costs between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally and act as a major parameter to decide the child’s eligibility. If you apply to 5 Universities, the average costs for the mentioned would be $1350-$1750, *without even receiving a guarantee to be selected*

*Edoofa has identified a solution for this uncertainty and unaffordability.* If a student qualifies after the eligibility check, not only does Edoofa help them draft their statement of purpose but also helps in terms of Visa Documentation Assistance, University Session and selection, Individual mentorship, etc, reducing the costs significantly to $750 which is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
29/01/24, 11:36 am - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/01/24, 11:37 am - +263 78 066 7844: Yes you can
29/01/24, 11:48 am - Pallika Edoofa: Alright!
29/01/24, 11:49 am - Pallika Edoofa: The enrollment fee is to be paid only if a child is found eligible for the Edoofa Scholarship Program after passing the eligibility check stage, it includes, 

*Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
*Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
*Earn While You Learn Program and training*
*University sessions and selection*
*A guaranteed scholarship seat*
*Visa Documentation Assistance*
*The Foster and Care throughout the course of an Edoofian*
29/01/24, 11:49 am - Pallika Edoofa: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge due to which parents might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short period of 7 days and for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option wherein if the student is found eligible, instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, *parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days thereby reducing the financial pressure.*
29/01/24, 12:02 pm - +263 77 324 8242: Understood,, I  really appreciate that you have people at heart you cater for individual different
29/01/24, 12:07 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright!
29/01/24, 12:07 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/01/24, 12:33 pm - +263 78 066 7844: We are in stage 4
29/01/24, 12:34 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Well, Shannet,
We also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.

*Step 1:Connect with a counsellor-* As your counsellor, now we are going through the counselling process discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Edoofa Scholarship.                        

*Step 2:Eligibility Check-* The eligibility check includes the interviews with the Academic Board and Scholarship Test.

*Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa-* If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter.

*Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program-* This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.

We are left with steps 5 and 6.
So shall I explain them to you?
29/01/24, 12:41 pm - +263 78 066 7844: Yes 
Go ahead
29/01/24, 1:01 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Sure
29/01/24, 1:01 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 5:* After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors. They will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. will be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by paying the registration fee within a few weeks.

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education and the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).
29/01/24, 1:01 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 6:* Once you are done with the registration fee payment, you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.
 
I hope you are clear with the process.
29/01/24, 1:13 pm - +263 78 066 7844: Yes you have made it clear
29/01/24, 1:18 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Do you have any questions for me now?
29/01/24, 1:23 pm - +263 78 066 7844: As for now I don't have any questions
29/01/24, 1:23 pm - +263 78 066 7844: Everything was well explain
29/01/24, 1:32 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Shannet, we have come to the end of your counselling session. Before I guide you Step 2 of the Eligibility Check, I want you to have a full-fledged discussion of the Edoofa program within your family as higher education is supposed to be a family decision. Ensure to include these aspects during the discussions:-

*About the EDOOFA Program and its vision of making Education Affordable and Edoofians Employment Ready.*
*Value of the career of an Edoofian after pursuing higher education in India.*
*The financial aspects and how Edoofa brings in affordability and self-financing opportunities for students.*
29/01/24, 1:32 pm - Pallika Edoofa: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences,

*Edoofa’s Website- www.edoofa.com* 
*Pictures (Edoofians from Africa studying in India): https://tinyurl.com/3ke35s35*

*Please ensure to go through the FAQ document before the next stage and refer the same to your family as it has answers to most of the queries.* Furthermore, if you have any other queries I would suggest that you note them down and we will discuss them in the next session.

Let me also share a few pictures of the students who are studying in India through the Edoofa Program so that you can witness the exposures and their experiences.

Are you clear about the same?

6) It is a program in which the students are given real time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits that are equivalent to physical cash. However the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of education fees and make their university education more affordable to pay  

7) Yes it is clear
30/01/24, 11:48 am - Pallika Edoofa: Well done, Shannet!
30/01/24, 11:49 am - Pallika Edoofa: @263773248242 @263772244216 Dear Parents, you see as per my experience over the last couple of years, I have been fortunate to have assisted over hundreds of students in achieving their career aspiration through the Edoofa Program. 

One of my key observations during helping out these students was regarding what was the common trait amongst students who are today having the best of their time in India through the Edoofa Program, and honestly I was able to come down to only one aspect that is FAMILY SUPPORT.
30/01/24, 11:49 am - Pallika Edoofa: You see in this journey of any child's higher education, there are three major contributors 

1. Student himself/herself
2. FAMILY
3. EDOOFA PROGAM

Now all the students who are today successfully a part of the Edoofa Program, had all these three contributors working together towards the common goal which is student's success and ensuring that by the time student completes his/her higher education they should be able to get good paying jobs. 

Even if any one of the contributor does not perform to the best of their abilities, Student's overall success is hampered. Let me give you a few examples

*In the event if student wishes to work hard, Edoofa is willing to support but the Family is not willing to support, the student will not be successful under the program*

*In the event if student wishes to work hard, Family is willing to support, but Edoofa's academic Board doesn't find the student worthy, the student will not be successful under the program*

*In the event if Family is willing to support, Edoofa's Academic Board is willing to support but the student doesn't wishes to work hard, then also the student will not be successful under the program*
30/01/24, 11:49 am - Pallika Edoofa: During the evaluation of your child's application so far, the Academic Board has evaluated a few aspects, such as student's willingness to work hard, and family's willingness to support the student so that the student can achieve what he/she has aspired. However now in your interview ahead, the Academic Board would be strictly be evaluating the Family's support towards the child higher education. 

*As you know in the event if your child is found eligible, you would have to complete a certain part of the formalities within the 7 day timeline, so may I know regarding the same, are you willing to support your child to the fullest?*
30/01/24, 11:53 am - +263 77 324 8242: We are more than  200% willing to support her
30/01/24, 11:55 am - Pallika Edoofa: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need
30/01/24, 11:55 am - Pallika Edoofa: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
30/01/24, 11:55 am - Pallika Edoofa: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below
30/01/24, 11:55 am - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
30/01/24, 11:55 am - Pallika Edoofa: I hope now you know Ideally, the tentative dates:

1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 1st or 2nd of February 2024 for $200 and the 1st or 2nd of March for the remaining $150.

2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 1st or 2nd of February 2024

Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?
30/01/24, 12:01 pm - +263 77 324 8242: 1
30/01/24, 12:02 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That is well noted!
30/01/24, 12:03 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Dear Parents, @263772244216 @263773248242, If we begin the eligibility check stage of your child today, it would be of 1-2 days after which the results will be out which means if your child qualifies for the Edoofa Scholarship, the due date for the first part of the enrollment fee ($200)will fall on the First week of February. Are you confident and comfortable with the timeframe?
30/01/24, 12:14 pm - +263 77 324 8242: Yes, very confident and comfortable
30/01/24, 12:15 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Thank you for the acknowledgement, dear parent!

02/02/24, 11:40 am - +263 77 324 8242: 200 to be paid before 8 February
The Remaining 150 to be cleared  by 8 March.. We use Mr Jerera's FBC account. I stand to be corrected
02/02/24, 11:41 am - Pallika Edoofa: Absolutely!
That is well noted!
02/02/24, 11:42 am - Pallika Edoofa: Are you clear with the modes of enrollment fee payment?
02/02/24, 11:45 am - +263 77 324 8242: I understand that if the Edoofa fails to get the university the enrollment fees is refunded but if the student fails to turn up no refund is made
02/02/24, 11:47 am - Pallika Edoofa: Can you elaborate on what exactly do you mean by student fails to turn up please?
02/02/24, 11:56 am - +263 77 324 8242: May you please help by explaining it for me maybe I did not get it well
02/02/24, 12:08 pm - Pallika Edoofa: @263773248242, If I understand you well, you would like me to explain the refund clause mentioned in your Letter of Acceptance right?
02/02/24, 12:11 pm - +263 77 324 8242: Yes please
02/02/24, 12:12 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Let me explain!
02/02/24, 12:12 pm - Pallika Edoofa: You see refund is applicable when Edoofa fails to provide an admission to the student, now if you remember, during your counselling session I did brief you that Edoofa only fails to provide an admission to the student who has successfully enrolled in the Program, when the student ends up failing in their A Level or Bachelor's results.
02/02/24, 12:14 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Therefore because of Edoofa's rigorous evaluation process, only the student who are competent for the Program are found eligible, therefore chances of a student failing their final A Level in quite marginal. However incase if a student does end up failing then they explore this option.
02/02/24, 12:19 pm - +263 77 324 8242: I thank you
02/02/24, 12:19 pm - Pallika Edoofa: You are most welcome!
02/02/24, 12:20 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Is there anything else you would like me to ask?
02/02/24, 12:21 pm - +263 77 324 8242: No more questions
02/02/24, 12:23 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright,
