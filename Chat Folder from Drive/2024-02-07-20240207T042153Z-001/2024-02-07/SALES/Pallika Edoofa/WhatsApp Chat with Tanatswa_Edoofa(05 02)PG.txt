06/02/24, 10:41 am - Pallika Edoofa: Ms. Chikafu, Continuing the session, Before proceeding towards the course discussion, I would like to know that if Tanatswa is interested in the medical field so why haven't she opted for Biology in her A level?
06/02/24, 10:47 am - +263 77 227 3336: Local universities preferes Chemistry for Medical Sciences that is why
06/02/24, 10:49 am - Pallika Edoofa: Ms. Chifaku, I understand!

Let me tell you that the requirements vary depending on the country Since Medical Education and Engineering are two aspects for which the Indian Education System is known, both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level: Physics, Chemistry, and Biology. If they want to study any Engineering Course, they should have Physics and Mathematics at their A level mandatorily.
06/02/24, 10:49 am - Pallika Edoofa: Since your child does not have Biology, I regret to inform you that you are not eligible for Medicine and Pharmacy, but considering your interest there are better courses from the Medical Field itself that you are eligible for and which can help fulfill your dreams of working in this field

*B.Sc. in Medical Laboratory Technology*

*Bachelor of Pharmacy(B.Pharm.)*

*BTech in Biomedical Engineering*

*B.Sc. in Nutrition and Dietetics*

Would you like me to explain any of these programs for her?
06/02/24, 10:53 am - +263 77 227 3336: Besides Medical Field what are the best courses that she can.do with her combination
06/02/24, 11:00 am - Pallika Edoofa: Ms. Chifaku, please note that she can pursue the courses like engineering, social work, law, and business management as well
06/02/24, 11:04 am - +263 77 227 3336: Please give me the Engineering courses so she can choose
06/02/24, 11:18 am - Pallika Edoofa: May I know in which specific field of engineering you are interested for her as it is a vast field!
06/02/24, 11:30 am - +263 77 227 3336: I would need to consult her first then come back to you
06/02/24, 11:36 am - Pallika Edoofa: Sure!

06/02/24, 11:40 am - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, I do appreciate your understanding of the current circumstances with the large number of applicants and the restricted number of scholarship slots, particularly during this time when the A-level results are being announced. Given the significance of this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and the volume of applications we are presently receiving, it would be greatly appreciated if you could respond to be considered for a scholarship seat.
