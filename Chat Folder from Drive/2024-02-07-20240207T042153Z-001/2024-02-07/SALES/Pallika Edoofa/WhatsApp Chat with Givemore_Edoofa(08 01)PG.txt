How are you doing today?

12/01/24, 2:22 pm - +263 71 852 4406: Hope I find you well
12/01/24, 2:24 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Continuing the discussion, Let me brief you that, I want to brief you that the criteria before the pandemic was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is *a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.
12/01/24, 2:24 pm - Pallika Edoofa: And, As your evaluation progresses, I appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country. In this process did you do any prior research on foreign education or applied to any University abroad?
12/01/24, 2:25 pm - +263 71 852 4406: Yes I am so confident
12/01/24, 2:28 pm - +263 71 852 4406: Yeah I did a research on foreign education but not yet applied
12/01/24, 2:28 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
12/01/24, 2:45 pm - +263 71 852 4406: Oky
12/01/24, 3:04 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Givemore, Based on my evaluation, considering your subjects, interests, and passion, you are eligible to pursue

22/01/24, 2:32 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I am sure after seeing all these amazing facts, you will be intrigued to study in India. So can you now tell me, How would studying in India have a positive impact on your career and help you achieve your goals?
22/01/24, 2:36 pm - +263 71 852 4406: My father will be only available on Sunday and sometimes around 9 and 10 pm and it will be past your working hours
22/01/24, 2:40 pm - +263 71 852 4406: On my career side I will be a well qualified worker since I got better education and knowledge on such activities for example onBBA
22/01/24, 2:43 pm - +263 71 852 4406: Can I ask you something
22/01/24, 3:02 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Sure
22/01/24, 3:02 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Please ask!
22/01/24, 10:19 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
22/01/24, 10:26 pm - +263 71 852 4406: Sorry for such a question but I want to know is the Edoofa scholarship program gonna assist for flight fees or one can do at his or her own
22/01/24, 10:27 pm - +263 71 852 4406: About visa and many more
23/01/24, 10:06 am - Pallika Edoofa: Good Afternoon to you all,
How are you doing today?
23/01/24, 1:53 pm - +263 71 852 4406: How are you
23/01/24, 1:56 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I am doing well, what about you?
23/01/24, 1:57 pm - +263 71 852 4406: So far so good
23/01/24, 1:58 pm - +263 71 852 4406: Please
23/01/24, 2:00 pm - Pallika Edoofa: If you understand the concept of International Education, the finances that play a major role is not visa fee or flight ticket because visa fee is given once in the whole program and the flight ticket is taken a limited number of times,maybe twice or once,because international students don't often travel back to their country.

They look forward to settling down and making sure education is not hampered.So they learn and do internships at breaks.But still students can definitely visit their family during holidays and spend time with them.

But I personally have seen that students don't travel often,so considering these the traveling fee
*(air fare :-around $400,Visa fee:-$83) is to be borne by the student* which is mostly a one time investment.
23/01/24, 8:56 pm - +263 71 852 4406: Oky thanks if you say so because my father was so worried about the visa and flight fees
23/01/24, 9:03 pm - +263 71 852 4406: Because of his salary he could not afford to pay flight fees and visa because here in Zimbabwe it cost about $2000 usd
23/01/24, 9:05 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Givemore, I understand that!
23/01/24, 9:06 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I would like to share with you that the Edoofa scholarship program not only provides you the scholarship up to 50-100% but also provides you an opportunity to self finance your higher education!
23/01/24, 9:34 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
24/01/24, 4:58 am - +263 71 852 4406: Oky sir
24/01/24, 9:42 am - Pallika Edoofa: Good afternoon Givemore and Dear Parents,
I hope that this message finds you well today.

Shall we continue our discussion, please?
24/01/24, 10:50 am - +263 71 852 4406: Ojy
24/01/24, 10:50 am - +263 71 852 4406: Oky
24/01/24, 12:25 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Kindly excuse for the delay my network is acting up today.
24/01/24, 12:26 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Before proceeding towards self financing your higher education by earning 50-100$ worth scholarship credits I would like to know that *By any chance are you familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship?*
24/01/24, 2:23 pm - +263 71 852 4406: No I wasn't sure Sir
24/01/24, 3:10 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That’s alright, Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India compared to other global hubs.

In India, international students face an average expense of *$6000-$8000 annually.* While this is very low as compared to the Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc where the cost of education ranges from $15000-$35000 annually, it is still beyond the reach of many.

With the Edoofa Scholarship Program, the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000 per annum* for the students who are found eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility Check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Laundry, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
24/01/24, 3:10 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
24/01/24, 3:10 pm - Pallika Edoofa: In simple words what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost $3000 or less a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well. 

However, as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even after this we allow the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.

*So do you feel the reduced cost of education is affordable to your family?*
24/01/24, 3:12 pm - +263 71 852 4406: Is the cost in us dollars or Indian currency
24/01/24, 3:22 pm - Pallika Edoofa: This cost is in USD
24/01/24, 4:35 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
24/01/24, 4:36 pm - Pallika Edoofa: _*In tomorrow's session I will be guiding you through a program to self-finance your Own education!!*_
24/01/24, 9:48 pm - +263 71 852 4406: Oky sir
24/01/24, 9:48 pm - +263 71 852 4406: As for my father I don't think so he could afford since he is the one working at the moment
25/01/24, 9:58 am - Pallika Edoofa: Greeting Everyone,
How are you all doing today?
25/01/24, 2:11 pm - +263 71 852 4406: I am good
25/01/24, 3:51 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for the delay as I was having my lunch!
25/01/24, 3:51 pm - Pallika Edoofa: May I know the reason for the delay?
25/01/24, 6:45 pm - +263 71 852 4406: Oky sir
25/01/24, 6:45 pm - +263 71 852 4406: I was at school
26/01/24, 9:35 am - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
26/01/24, 2:38 pm - +263 71 852 4406: Same to you
29/01/24, 9:48 am - Pallika Edoofa: Greetings to you all,
As scheduled, I am here to continue your sessions and evaluate your application.
29/01/24, 10:21 am - +263 71 852 4406: How are you
29/01/24, 10:26 am - +263 71 852 4406: Oky sir we can proceed
29/01/24, 10:31 am - Pallika Edoofa: How are you doing today, Givemore?
29/01/24, 10:31 am - Pallika Edoofa: Good to know, 
So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians. Looking at this cost of education as well, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits which can help in reducing their fees further.

Do you know how that is done?
29/01/24, 10:32 am - +263 71 852 4406: I am good
29/01/24, 10:32 am - +263 71 852 4406: Hope I find you well
29/01/24, 10:34 am - +263 71 852 4406: Earn while you learn program
29/01/24, 10:34 am - +263 71 852 4406: But you can also tell me as well
29/01/24, 10:40 am - Pallika Edoofa: That's right!
29/01/24, 10:40 am - Pallika Edoofa: That’s alright, Let me tell you how Edoofa helps Edoofians bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the *Earn While You Learn Program*

The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that are equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.The Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies and needs, converting an Individual into a market-ready professional. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
29/01/24, 10:40 am - Pallika Edoofa: *Projects with Brands and Companies: -*
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, such as:
*Africa Global Radio-* The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project and hear from the CEO about the exposures of the Edoofa program.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4DAP24ZuY4&authuser=0
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0
*Skooqs-* This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

*Recruitment Partners:-*
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

*Webinars:-*
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars regularly with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
-Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
-How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi
-How to be industry-ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu
-It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje
-Decoding the science of personal branding by Mr, Simon Maingi
29/01/24, 10:40 am - Pallika Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field. These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.

*What are your views on the same? Do you think you will be benefiting from the Earn While You Learn Program?*
29/01/24, 10:44 am - +263 71 852 4406: Yeah I will be more beneficial from the earn while you learn program since I will be helping my father
29/01/24, 10:49 am - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/01/24, 10:49 am - Pallika Edoofa: Absolutely,
If I have to help you explain how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable compared to Local Universities, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now, if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, bringing the cost further down to $1000 per year including the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month. *This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*

*You can see this even in this scholarship credit certificate where one of our star performers, our Proud Edoodians  Masinire Miriam earned $1965 within a year.* I hope you can now realize the power of the EWYL program to reduce the financial pressure on families.
29/01/24, 10:52 am - +263 71 852 4406: Yeah I am now realizing
29/01/24, 10:59 am - Pallika Edoofa: Great, Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, a few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :

*1. Expert Career Counselling:* We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counsellors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.

*2. Affordability through guaranteed scholarships:* Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off.

*3. Earn While You Learn:* The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing our students for the real world. 

*4.Higher Education Concierge:* A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.*

After going through these facts that make Edoofa different, which one out of the 4 did you feel is the most significant?

05/02/24, 6:35 pm - Pallika Edoofa: As you see, there is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it depends upon his/her hard work. However, who will be helping you with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
05/02/24, 6:40 pm - +263 71 852 4406: My father
05/02/24, 6:40 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That’s understandable,I believe you'll be discussing everything with your family after we complete today's session. Also, after our counselling session, I would connect to some of our beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know their experiences and proceedings well.

May I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
05/02/24, 6:41 pm - +263 71 852 4406: As for my family it is their wish as well
05/02/24, 6:42 pm - +263 71 852 4406: They all wish me a brighter future even sometime money become a challenge
05/02/24, 6:42 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, as studying Internationally would make your career advance at an even greater pace, as you will be transformed into a professional with a well-paying job, which would help you in uplifting your family there by yourself, and provide a peaceful and hassle-free life to your parents.
05/02/24, 6:42 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *As we move to the last part of the session, let me highlight a few requirements while a student applies alone* 

*1) Application Form* -An online or offline form that asks for your personal details and academic background.

*2) Statement of Purpose-* An essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and your aspirations for your career.

*3) Letter of Recommendation-* from Senior authorities, School Heads or others on why they recommend you to be a right fit for an international university.
Do you know about other requirements?
05/02/24, 6:45 pm - +263 71 852 4406: Would be a pleasure if you kindly notify other requirements
05/02/24, 6:45 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Sure, Please note When a student applies alone for an international University, on average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose costs between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally and act as a major parameter to decide the child’s eligibility. If you apply to 5 Universities, the average costs for the mentioned would be $1350-$1750, *without even receiving a guarantee to be selected*

*Edoofa has identified a solution for this uncertainty and unaffordability.* If a student qualifies after the eligibility check, not only does Edoofa help them draft their statement of purpose but also helps in terms of Visa Documentation Assistance, University Session and selection, Individual mentorship, etc, reducing the costs significantly to $750 which is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
05/02/24, 6:45 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
05/02/24, 6:47 pm - +263 71 852 4406: Of course you may Sir
05/02/24, 6:47 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright!
05/02/24, 6:48 pm - Pallika Edoofa: There are 3 phases to the enrollment process.
 
*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation
If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Acceptance Letter. You are supposed to pay the enrollment fee of $350 in 7 days for the scholarship seat reservation and to begin the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2*: Once the students complete Phase 1 they will be starting the Earn While You Learn program session(Each student will have an opportunity to earn scholarship credits that can be used to reduce their fee even before their A-Level result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final A-level results are out and the student has passed the requirement as per Edoofa, then their final university evaluation and Admission will continue. However, if the student wouldn’t meet the requirements as per the university and Edoofa, then the $350 will be refunded to the parent.

The amount of credits earned by the student in phase 2 can be used for the first year’s annual fee itself so that parents are relieved from financial stress paving the way for proper financial planning for higher education.
05/02/24, 6:48 pm - Pallika Edoofa: The enrollment fee is to be paid only if a child is found eligible for the Edoofa Scholarship Program after passing the eligibility check stage, it includes, 

*Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
*Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
*Earn While You Learn Program and training*
*University sessions and selection*
*A guaranteed scholarship seat*
*Visa Documentation Assistance*
*The Foster and Care throughout the course of an Edoofian*
05/02/24, 6:48 pm - Pallika Edoofa: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge due to which parents might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short period of 7 days and for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option wherein if the student is found eligible, instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, *parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days thereby reducing the financial pressure.*
05/02/24, 6:51 pm - +263 71 852 4406: Well noted Sir
05/02/24, 6:52 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
05/02/24, 6:54 pm - +263 71 852 4406: Stage 1
05/02/24, 6:54 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's right!
05/02/24, 6:54 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Well, Givemore,
We also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.

*Step 1:Connect with a counsellor-* As your counsellor, now we are going through the counselling process discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Edoofa Scholarship.                        

*Step 2:Eligibility Check-* The eligibility check includes the interviews with the Academic Board and Scholarship Test.

*Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa-* If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter.

*Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program-* This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.

We are left with steps 5 and 6.
So shall I explain them to you?
05/02/24, 6:55 pm - +263 71 852 4406: Oky sir
05/02/24, 6:55 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Please let me explain the remaining steps
05/02/24, 6:56 pm - +263 71 852 4406: Oky explain
05/02/24, 6:56 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 5:* After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities. 

August 2025 intake applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 instalments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.
05/02/24, 6:56 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 6 :* Once you are done with the registration fee payment, you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.

I hope you are clear with the process.
05/02/24, 6:56 pm - +263 71 852 4406: Yeah thanks
05/02/24, 6:57 pm - +263 71 852 4406: Thank you sir
05/02/24, 6:59 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Do you have any queries?
05/02/24, 7:01 pm - +263 71 852 4406: No at the moment
05/02/24, 7:04 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright!
05/02/24, 7:20 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Givemore, we have come to the end of your counselling session. Before I guide you Step 2 of the Eligibility Check, I want you to have a full-fledged discussion of the Edoofa program within your family as higher education is supposed to be a family decision. Ensure to include these aspects during the discussions:-

*About the EDOOFA Program and its vision of making Education Affordable and Edoofians Employment Ready.*
*Value of the career of an Edoofian after pursuing higher education in India.*
*The financial aspects and how Edoofa brings in affordability and self-financing opportunities for students.*
05/02/24, 7:22 pm - Pallika Edoofa: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences,

*Edoofa’s Website- www.edoofa.com* 
*Pictures (Edoofians from Africa studying in India): https://tinyurl.com/3ke35s35*

*Please ensure to go through the FAQ document before the next stage and refer the same to your family as it has answers to most of the queries.* Furthermore, if you have any other queries I would suggest that you note them down and we will discuss them in the next session.

Let me also share a few pictures of the students who are studying in India through the Edoofa Program so that you can witness the exposures and their experiences.

06/02/24, 12:24 pm - +263 71 852 4406: As for now I don't think so since it is their wish for me to study abroad
06/02/24, 12:25 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That is fine, 

May I know the thoughts and opinions of your family regarding the financial aspects such as enrollment fees and cost of education, please
06/02/24, 12:26 pm - +263 71 852 4406: They thought the scholarship program was a 100%
06/02/24, 12:27 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Please note that Edoofa is a partially funded scholarship program! 

The final percentage of the scholarship will be decided after the University Sessions of an Edoofian after his/her enrollment

The percentage of scholarships is determined by the following factors

1) Academic Excellence
2) Merit
3) Previous Experiences
4) Recommendations from Edoofa
5) Statement of Purpose(SOP) 
6) Extracurricular Activities

So the universities will evaluate them to decide the final quantum of the scholarship
06/02/24, 12:28 pm - +263 71 852 4406: Yeah I already told them
06/02/24, 12:29 pm - +263 71 852 4406: And it is their wish for me to get higher%
06/02/24, 12:29 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's great!

06/02/24, 12:30 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Givemore, Before we move to the Eligibility Procedures, can you tell me?

1. What is the name of the course that you would be studying through the Edoofa Program?

2. In which country will you be studying through the Edoofa program?

3. What is the average cost of studies in India without a scholarship?

4. What is the annual fee you will pay if found eligible for the program?

5. What is the enrollment fee of the Edoofa Program and in how many days is it paid if you are found eligible?

6. Please elaborate on your understanding of the Earn While You Learn program in 75-100 words.

7. After receiving your offer letter from the University, you will have to pay your registration fee to finalize your university selection and reserve your scholarship seat in a particular university, this registration fee will be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?
06/02/24, 12:30 pm - +263 71 852 4406: Oky sir and I also appreciate your willingness even during hard time

06/02/24, 2:40 pm - +263 71 852 4406: 5 $200 in seven days then 150 within 3 weeks
6 Earn while you learn program is a program that gives Scholarship credits . The scholarship credit can be used to finance a portion of the fees.
06/02/24, 2:41 pm - +263 71 852 4406: During the program .
06/02/24, 2:42 pm - +263 71 852 4406: Yes
06/02/24, 2:45 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Givemore!
06/02/24, 2:46 pm - Pallika Edoofa: @263773667389 you see as per my experience over the last couple of years, I have been fortunate to have assisted over hundreds of students in achieving their career aspiration through the Edoofa Program. 

One of my key observations during helping out these students was regarding what was the common trait amongst students who are today having the best of their time in India through the Edoofa Program, and honestly I was able to come down to only one aspect that is FAMILY SUPPORT.
06/02/24, 2:46 pm - Pallika Edoofa: You see in this journey of any child's higher education, there are three major contributors 

1. Student himself/herself
2. FAMILY
3. EDOOFA PROGAM

Now all the students who are today successfully a part of the Edoofa Program, had all these three contributors working together towards the common goal which is student's success and ensuring that by the time student completes his/her higher education they should be able to get good paying jobs. 

Even if any one of the contributor does not perform to the best of their abilities, Student's overall success is hampered. Let me give you a few examples

*In the event if student wishes to work hard, Edoofa is willing to support but the Family is not willing to support, the student will not be successful under the program*

*In the event if student wishes to work hard, Family is willing to support, but Edoofa's academic Board doesn't find the student worthy, the student will not be successful under the program*

*In the event if Family is willing to support, Edoofa's Academic Board is willing to support but the student doesn't wishes to work hard, then also the student will not be successful under the program*
06/02/24, 2:46 pm - Pallika Edoofa: During the evaluation of your child's application so far, the Academic Board has evaluated a few aspects, such as student's willingness to work hard, and family's willingness to support the student so that the student can achieve what he/she has aspired. However now in your interview ahead, the Academic Board would be strictly be evaluating the Family's support towards the child higher education. 

*As you know in the event if your child is found eligible, you would have to complete a certain part of the formalities within the 7 day timeline, so may I know regarding the same, are you willing to support your child to the fullest?*
