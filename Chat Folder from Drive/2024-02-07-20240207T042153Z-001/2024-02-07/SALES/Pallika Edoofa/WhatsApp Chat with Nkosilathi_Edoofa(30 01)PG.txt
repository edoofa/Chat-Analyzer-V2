Please go ahead, and tell me about yourself: your strengths, your weaknesses, your hobbies, and a detailed description of your family background. Also do share the following details:
*1. Your current educational level (O Level/ L5/ U6) and subject combination**
*2. The course you would like to study and your area of interest in higher education?*
*3. What do your parents do (their profession)?*
*4. What is your parent’s highest education level?*
*5. Do you have any siblings? if yes, what do they do?*
*6. Who has been financially supporting you for your Education so far?*

*8. Which province in Zimbabwe are you from?*
*9. What is the name of your O-level and A-level school and how much was your per-term fee in school in USD($)?*
*10. The year in which your A level will end?*
03/02/24, 7:02 pm - +263 77 749 7730: Based on self assessment, I would say my biggest strength is the ability to absorb knowledge dominantly through practical experiences rather than theoretical ones. While I have no problem with theoretical knowledge, I always feel the zeal to turn that theory into practice for my own better understanding. 
My weakness, as an introvert, is the inability to function within a team. This has been my longest lasting drawback and due to this, I have been working tireless to eradicate this tendency. 
Lack of immense physique repelled me from any sports thus my hobbies are more technologically inclined. I am more than interested in the fascinating world of science and engineering dominantly in creating small projects that uplifts my community and the world at large. 
My background is just like any other family. Both parents are equal financial contributors to the family, with my father working as the Procurement Manager, while my mother is self empowered. 


1. I am currently U6 taking Mathematics, Physics, Computer Science and Geography. 
2. ⁠I am interested in studying Mechatronics Engineering.
