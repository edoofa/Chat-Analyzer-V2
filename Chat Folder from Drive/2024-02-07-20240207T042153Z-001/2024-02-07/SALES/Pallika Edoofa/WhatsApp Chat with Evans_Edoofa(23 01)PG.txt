On this positive note, are we good to begin today's session?
24/01/24, 9:33 am - +263 77 254 1679: Good morning. Yes l'm ready
24/01/24, 9:45 am - Pallika Edoofa: How are you doing today?
24/01/24, 9:45 am - +263 77 254 1679: I'm doing well thanks
24/01/24, 4:14 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
25/01/24, 9:55 am - Pallika Edoofa: Greeting Everyone,
How are you all doing today?
25/01/24, 10:23 am - +263 77 254 1679: Greetings. I am alright thanks
25/01/24, 10:26 am - Pallika Edoofa: Glad to know that!
25/01/24, 10:27 am - Pallika Edoofa: Kindly excuse for yesterday, please!
25/01/24, 10:35 am - +263 77 254 1679: Ok thanks
25/01/24, 10:54 am - Pallika Edoofa: Mrs. Katiyo, Continuing the discussion, Please note that the Edoofa Scholarship offers 50-100% scholarship on the tuition fees and based on the performance and evaluations of our Academic Board, one can even achieve a higher quantum of the scholarship but the remaining cost after the scholarship such as Living and Transportation is catered by a student's family.  I will be guiding you through the financial aspects of the program.

Will you as a Family be able to manage the remaining expenses?
25/01/24, 10:57 am - +263 77 254 1679: Greetings once again. Foe the expenses it's difficult to meet them since both Evans parents are just peasant farmers without employment. It would be difficult to meet financial expenses for him.
25/01/24, 11:31 am - Pallika Edoofa: I understand, Mrs. Katiyo. Please take into consideration that once Evans becomes eligible, he can participate in the "Earn While You Learn" program. This initiative enables students to self-finance their education, thereby reducing the financial burden on their parents. By earning $50-100 a month through this program, Evans can contribute towards lowering his tuition fees.
25/01/24, 11:32 am - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
25/01/24, 11:42 am - +263 77 254 1679: This is actually a good initiative. We appreciate it.
25/01/24, 12:01 pm - Pallika Edoofa: So, Do you think you will be able to manage?
25/01/24, 2:37 pm - +263 77 254 1679: I suggest he will do the Earn while you learn program. It's good that way
25/01/24, 4:14 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for the delay as I was having my lunch!
25/01/24, 4:14 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright!

30/01/24, 12:05 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright Evans
30/01/24, 12:05 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Considering your interests, Let me tell you that we do not offer Actuarial science as a course, while Actuarial Science is indeed an independent and specialized degree program, there are certain aspects to consider that make a Bachelor of Commerce (BCom) a favorable alternative for students
While Actuarial Science is a field with a unique focus on risk management and financial security, the comprehensive nature of a BCom degree can offer a strong foundation for a successful and diverse career in various other sectors including risk management and financial security.
30/01/24, 12:06 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Shall I explain the course depth to you?
30/01/24, 12:07 pm - +263 78 076 9299: Okay...you can go ahead
30/01/24, 12:07 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Sure
30/01/24, 12:07 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Let me explain BCOM in depth to you, please!
30/01/24, 12:08 pm - +263 78 076 9299: Okay  ..fine thank you
30/01/24, 12:08 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Bachelor of Commerce (B.com)* is a three year long undergraduate course that is evenly distributed into 6 half-yearly semesters. 

A high number of jobs are available for B.com graduates in industries such as Information Technology, Manufacturing, Telecommunications and Banking.The most sought after B.Com. jobs are Financial Manger, Accountant, Lecturer, Chartered Accountant, Human Resource Development etc.

The 3 year B.com degree program aims to facilitate a deep understanding of how business organizations work. It develops knowledge and skills in core B.com subjects like Accounting, Finance, Banking & Insurance, Marketing, Human Resources and Taxation.
The entire B.com syllabus is designed in a manner which develops competency in students, allowing them to pursue higher level programs. It also increases practical knowledge and employability.

*B.Com graduates can pursue post-graduation courses such as M.Com (Master of Commerce), MBA (Master of Business Administration), CA (Chartered Accountant), CS (Company Secretary), Actuarial Scientist, and ACCA (Association of Chartered Accountants).*

*B.Com graduates have a plethora of job positions in government as well as private sectors to choose from provided that they are not limited to careers in accounts and finance*
30/01/24, 12:17 pm - +263 78 076 9299: Okay ...i understand but cant i specialise in a certain trade like telecommunications  and banking .According to your explanation  im getting you from this angle, B.com is covering a wide array of courses ounder it ...
30/01/24, 12:19 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Absolutely, I understand your desire to specialize, and it's a great consideration. However, pursuing a Bachelor of Commerce (B.Com) does offer a wide range of courses that encompass various fields, including telecommunications and banking. B.Com provides a solid foundation in business and finance, making it versatile and applicable to different industries.

While actuarial science is a specialized field, B.Com can still be a strategic choice as it equips you with a comprehensive understanding of business principles, economics, and financial management. This broader knowledge base can enhance your flexibility and marketability in the professional world, allowing you to explore diverse career paths within the business and financial sector. Additionally, B.Com provides a valuable platform from which you can later choose to specialize further through postgraduate studies or professional certifications if desired.
30/01/24, 12:21 pm - +263 78 076 9299: Okay thank u i understand...
30/01/24, 12:30 pm - Pallika Edoofa: So, are you willing to pursue this?

30/01/24, 12:40 pm - +263 78 076 9299: Okay..in five years , according to my view about this course i would  be working since this course covers a myriad of trades under it therefore i will be very markatable in the job industry.Moreso being an Edoofian will impart more skills to me and this therefore will help me to give back to my country or even my community through imparting the skills to others.
30/01/24, 12:47 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I appreciate and admire your insight.

However, as your concierge, I would like to inform you that the professional path you have selected will need a significant amount of hard work and attention.

So, are you prepared to put in *200%* effort and seize any possibilities that come your way in order to alter your career?

30/01/24, 4:16 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career. I believe you will be researching about the course in detail.

This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*

31/01/24, 9:51 am - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
31/01/24, 9:51 am - Pallika Edoofa: In simple words what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost $3000 or less a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well. 

However, as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even after this we allow the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.

*So do you feel the reduced cost of education is affordable to your family?*
31/01/24, 9:53 am - +263 78 076 9299: Okay i understand but this 1500-2300 is paid annually .how much will be paid per semester..
31/01/24, 9:56 am - Pallika Edoofa: Evans, Please note that our admissions team will be guiding you for the same, as it will be decided once you found eligible and the percentage of the scholarship
31/01/24, 9:58 am - +263 78 076 9299: Okay i understand
31/01/24, 10:04 am - Pallika Edoofa: Yes Evans!
31/01/24, 10:04 am - Pallika Edoofa: Also, let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians. Looking at this cost of education as well, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits which can help in reducing their fees further.

Do you know how that is done?
31/01/24, 10:05 am - +263 78 076 9299: Yes i know
31/01/24, 10:19 am - Pallika Edoofa: Please let me know how!
31/01/24, 10:23 am - +263 78 076 9299: Edoofa provides programmes like earn while you learn .this therefore will help students to cover some of the expenses like transport and part of their fees
31/01/24, 10:41 am - Pallika Edoofa: That’s alright, Let me tell you how Edoofa helps Edoofians bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the *Earn While You Learn Program*

The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that are equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.The Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies and needs, converting an Individual into a market-ready professional. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
31/01/24, 10:41 am - Pallika Edoofa: *Projects with Brands and Companies: -*
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, such as:
*Africa Global Radio-* The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project and hear from the CEO about the exposures of the Edoofa program.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0
*Skooqs-* This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

*Recruitment Partners:-*
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

*Webinars:-*
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars regularly with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
-Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
-How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi
-How to be industry-ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu
-It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje
-Decoding the science of personal branding by Mr, Simon Maingi
31/01/24, 10:41 am - Pallika Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field. These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.

*What are your views on the same? Do you think you will be benefiting from the Earn While You Learn Program?*
31/01/24, 10:48 am - +263 78 076 9299: Yes ...the Earn while you learn programme is very beneficial since it helps me to learn and develop the skills necessary for digital workspace environment-which namely include reasearch; content writing ,SEO,digital marketing jus to mention a few.this will help my innovative and entrepreneurship  skills .
31/01/24, 10:49 am - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
31/01/24, 10:49 am - Pallika Edoofa: Absolutely,
If I have to help you explain how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable compared to Local Universities, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now, if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, bringing the cost further down to $1000 per year including the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month. *This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*

*You can see this even in this scholarship credit certificate where one of our star performers, our Proud Edoodians  Masinire Miriam earned $1965 within a year.* I hope you can now realize the power of the EWYL program to reduce the financial pressure on families.
31/01/24, 10:50 am - +263 78 076 9299: Yes
31/01/24, 10:51 am - Pallika Edoofa: Great, Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, a few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :

*1. Expert Career Counselling:* We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counsellors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.

*2. Affordability through guaranteed scholarships:* Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off.

*3. Earn While You Learn:* The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing our students for the real world. 

*4.Higher Education Concierge:* A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.*

After going through these facts that make Edoofa different, which one out of the 4 did you feel is the most significant?
31/01/24, 10:56 am - +263 78 076 9299: I just feel the earn while you learn to be the most significant  ...as it imparts a lot of skills to students at the same time tgey will be in a position of rising part of their fees thereby helping their parents especially  for those with a poorly backed financial  background
31/01/24, 11:05 am - Pallika Edoofa: Great! 
So now I know you focus more on affordability and employability.
Let me also show you some monthly earnings of students through Earn While You Learn.

31/01/24, 11:06 am - Pallika Edoofa: As you see, there is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it depends upon his/her hard work. However, who will be helping you with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
31/01/24, 11:09 am - +263 78 076 9299: My parents..
31/01/24, 11:10 am - Pallika Edoofa: That’s understandable,I believe you'll be discussing everything with your family after we complete today's session. Also, after our counselling session, I would connect to some of our beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know their experiences and proceedings well.

May I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
31/01/24, 11:11 am - +263 78 076 9299: Actually...everyone feels great about  that
31/01/24, 11:12 am - Pallika Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, as studying Internationally would make your career advance at an even greater pace, as you will be transformed into a professional with a well-paying job, which would help you in uplifting your family there by yourself, and provide a peaceful and hassle-free life to your parents.
31/01/24, 11:12 am - Pallika Edoofa: *As we move to the last part of the session, let me highlight a few requirements while a student applies alone* 

*1) Application Form* -An online or offline form that asks for your personal details and academic background.

*2) Statement of Purpose-* An essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and your aspirations for your career.

*3) Letter of Recommendation-* from Senior authorities, School Heads or others on why they recommend you to be a right fit for an international university.
Do you know about other requirements?
31/01/24, 11:14 am - +263 78 076 9299: No ...
31/01/24, 11:20 am - Pallika Edoofa: That's alright, When a student applies alone for an international University, on average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose costs between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally and act as a major parameter to decide the child’s eligibility. If you apply to 5 Universities, the average costs for the mentioned would be $1350-$1750, *without even receiving a guarantee to be selected*

*Edoofa has identified a solution for this uncertainty and unaffordability.* If a student qualifies after the eligibility check, not only does Edoofa help them draft their statement of purpose but also helps in terms of Visa Documentation Assistance, University Session and selection, Individual mentorship, etc, reducing the costs significantly to $750 which is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.

01/02/24, 9:35 am - Pallika Edoofa: Greetings,
I am here to begin the session,
Are you ready for the same?
01/02/24, 8:43 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Evans, I was expecting a response from you, May I know if everything is alright?
01/02/24, 8:45 pm - +263 78 076 9299: Everything  is fine....im icurring network challenges sometimes ...its raining where i am.so sometimes i just go offline as result of  network problems
01/02/24, 8:48 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Oh That's alright, I understand!
01/02/24, 8:49 pm - +263 78 076 9299: Okay thank you for understanding
01/02/24, 8:49 pm - Pallika Edoofa: May I know if you can be available tomorrow?
01/02/24, 8:50 pm - +263 78 076 9299: Yes ...i will be available ...
02/02/24, 9:44 am - Pallika Edoofa: Greetings Evans and Dear Parents,
How are you all doing?
02/02/24, 10:01 am - +263 78 076 9299: We are doing great
02/02/24, 10:08 am - Pallika Edoofa: Glad to know that!
02/02/24, 10:09 am - Pallika Edoofa: Please let me share that *why and when the enrollment fee is paid*
02/02/24, 10:09 am - Pallika Edoofa: The enrollment fee is to be paid only if a child is found eligible for the Edoofa Scholarship Program after passing the eligibility check stage, it includes, 

*Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
*Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
*Earn While You Learn Program and training*
*University sessions and selection*
*A guaranteed scholarship seat*
*Visa Documentation Assistance*
*The Foster and Care throughout the course of an Edoofian*
02/02/24, 10:09 am - Pallika Edoofa: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge due to which parents might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short period of 7 days and for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option wherein if the student is found eligible, instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, *parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days thereby reducing the financial pressure.*

06/02/24, 2:46 pm - Pallika Edoofa: How are you doing today?
06/02/24, 2:47 pm - +263 78 076 9299: Im very great and you
06/02/24, 2:47 pm - Pallika Edoofa: May I know the reason for the inactiveness?
06/02/24, 2:48 pm - +263 78 076 9299: Power shortages to charge the phones ...
06/02/24, 2:49 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Oh I understand!
06/02/24, 2:49 pm - +263 78 076 9299: Thank you for understanding

06/02/24, 2:51 pm - Pallika Edoofa: May I know the what do you mean by this?
06/02/24, 2:53 pm - +263 78 076 9299: Sorry i did not read the question  properly
06/02/24, 2:53 pm - +263 78 076 9299: We had discussed  stage 1 and 2
06/02/24, 2:54 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Well, Evans,
We also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.

*Step 1:Connect with a counsellor-* As your counsellor, now we are going through the counselling process discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Edoofa Scholarship.                        

*Step 2:Eligibility Check-* The eligibility check includes the interviews with the Academic Board and Scholarship Test.

*Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa-* If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter.

*Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program-* This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.

We are left with steps 5 and 6.
So shall I explain them to you?
06/02/24, 2:54 pm - +263 78 076 9299: Yes ...go ahead
06/02/24, 2:55 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 5:* After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors. They will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. will be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by paying the registration fee within a few weeks.

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education and the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).
06/02/24, 2:55 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 6:* Once you are done with the registration fee payment, you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.
 
I hope you are clear with the process.
06/02/24, 2:56 pm - +263 78 076 9299: Very clear...
06/02/24, 2:59 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Do you have any question?
06/02/24, 3:00 pm - +263 78 076 9299: No its clear...
06/02/24, 3:00 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright!
06/02/24, 3:00 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Evans, we have come to the end of your counselling session. Before I guide you Step 2 of the Eligibility Check, I want you to have a full-fledged discussion of the Edoofa program within your family as higher education is supposed to be a family decision. Ensure to include these aspects during the discussions:-

*About the EDOOFA Program and its vision of making Education Affordable and Edoofians Employment Ready.*
*Value of the career of an Edoofian after pursuing higher education in India.*
*The financial aspects and how Edoofa brings in affordability and self-financing opportunities for students.*
06/02/24, 3:01 pm - Pallika Edoofa: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences,

*Edoofa’s Website- www.edoofa.com* 
*Pictures (Edoofians from Africa studying in India): https://tinyurl.com/3ke35s35*

*Please ensure to go through the FAQ document before the next stage and refer the same to your family as it has answers to most of the queries.* Furthermore, if you have any other queries I would suggest that you note them down and we will discuss them in the next session.

Let me also share a few pictures of the students who are studying in India through the Edoofa Program so that you can witness the exposures and their experiences.
