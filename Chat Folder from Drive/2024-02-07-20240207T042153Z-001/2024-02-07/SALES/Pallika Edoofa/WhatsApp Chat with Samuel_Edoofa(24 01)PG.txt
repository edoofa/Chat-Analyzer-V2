In India, international students face an average expense of *$6000-$8000 annually.* While this is very low as compared to the Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc where the cost of education ranges from $15000-$35000 annually, it is still beyond the reach of many.

With the Edoofa Scholarship Program, the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000 per annum* for the students who are found eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility Check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Laundry, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
29/01/24, 1:36 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/01/24, 1:36 pm - Pallika Edoofa: In simple words what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost $3000 or less a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well. 

However, as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even after this we allow the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.

*So do you feel the reduced cost of education is affordable to your family?*
29/01/24, 1:45 pm - +265 983 65 00 01: The reduced cost of education is affordable to my family
29/01/24, 1:45 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Good to know, 
So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians. Looking at this cost of education as well, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits which can help in reducing their fees further.

Do you know how that is done?
29/01/24, 1:46 pm - +265 983 65 00 01: Can you briefly explain about the earn while you learn program.
29/01/24, 1:46 pm - Pallika Edoofa: sure
29/01/24, 1:47 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That’s alright, Let me tell you how Edoofa helps Edoofians bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the *Earn While You Learn Program*

The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that are equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.The Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies and needs, converting an Individual into a market-ready professional. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
29/01/24, 1:47 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Projects with Brands and Companies: -*
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, such as:
*Africa Global Radio-* The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project and hear from the CEO about the exposures of the Edoofa program.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4DAP24ZuY4&authuser=0
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0
*Skooqs-* This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

*Recruitment Partners:-*
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

*Webinars:-*
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars regularly with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
-Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
-How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi
-How to be industry-ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu
-It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje
-Decoding the science of personal branding by Mr, Simon Maingi
29/01/24, 1:47 pm - Pallika Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field. These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.

*What are your views on the same? Do you think you will be benefiting from the Earn While You Learn Program?*
29/01/24, 2:00 pm - +265 983 65 00 01: Earn while you learn program will be beneficial to my course. because to my own understanding it's like you work to pay for your course and other expenses.
29/01/24, 2:01 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/01/24, 2:01 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Absolutely,
If I have to help you explain how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable compared to Local Universities, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now, if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, bringing the cost further down to $1000 per year including the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month. *This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*

*You can see this even in this scholarship credit certificate where one of our star performers, our Proud Edoodians  Masinire Miriam earned $1965 within a year.* I hope you can now realize the power of the EWYL program to reduce the financial pressure on families.
29/01/24, 2:05 pm - +265 983 65 00 01: I understand everything
29/01/24, 2:05 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Great, Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, a few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :

*1. Expert Career Counselling:* We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counsellors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.

*2. Affordability through guaranteed scholarships:* Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off.

*3. Earn While You Learn:* The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing our students for the real world. 

*4.Higher Education Concierge:* A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.*

After going through these facts that make Edoofa different, which one out of the 4 did you feel is the most significant?
29/01/24, 2:11 pm - +265 983 65 00 01: The earn while you learn program is the most significant.
29/01/24, 2:11 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Great! 
So now I know you focus more on affordability and employability.
Let me also show you some monthly earnings of students through Earn While You Learn.

29/01/24, 2:12 pm - Pallika Edoofa: As you see, there is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it depends upon his/her hard work. However, who will be helping you with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
29/01/24, 2:16 pm - +265 983 65 00 01: My parents will be helping me with the remaining fees after the Edoofa scholarship and the earn while you learn program.
29/01/24, 2:17 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That’s understandable,I believe you'll be discussing everything with your family after we complete today's session. Also, after our counselling session, I would connect to some of our beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know their experiences and proceedings well.

May I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
29/01/24, 2:21 pm - +265 983 65 00 01: My family feel relieved about  me studying abroad since education here is expensive compared to the edoofa program.
29/01/24, 2:21 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, as studying Internationally would make your career advance at an even greater pace, as you will be transformed into a professional with a well-paying job, which would help you in uplifting your family there by yourself, and provide a peaceful and hassle-free life to your parents.
29/01/24, 2:22 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *As we move to the last part of the session, let me highlight a few requirements while a student applies alone* 

*1) Application Form* -An online or offline form that asks for your personal details and academic background.

*2) Statement of Purpose-* An essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and your aspirations for your career.

*3) Letter of Recommendation-* from Senior authorities, School Heads or others on why they recommend you to be a right fit for an international university.
Do you know about other requirements?
29/01/24, 3:15 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Samuel, Are we connected?
29/01/24, 3:29 pm - +265 983 65 00 01: Yes we are I just had issues with the network
29/01/24, 3:31 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's alright, I understand!
29/01/24, 3:31 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Also, When a student applies alone for an international University, on average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose costs between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally and act as a major parameter to decide the child’s eligibility. If you apply to 5 Universities, the average costs for the mentioned would be $1350-$1750, *without even receiving a guarantee to be selected*

*Edoofa has identified a solution for this uncertainty and unaffordability.* If a student qualifies after the eligibility check, not only does Edoofa help them draft their statement of purpose but also helps in terms of Visa Documentation Assistance, University Session and selection, Individual mentorship, etc, reducing the costs significantly to $750 which is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee
29/01/24, 3:31 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/01/24, 3:39 pm - +265 983 65 00 01: Please inform me when the  enrollment fee is paid.
29/01/24, 3:40 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Sure
29/01/24, 3:40 pm - Pallika Edoofa: The enrollment fee is to be paid only if a child is found eligible for the Edoofa Scholarship Program after passing the eligibility check stage, it includes, 

*Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
*Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
*Earn While You Learn Program and training*
*University sessions and selection*
*A guaranteed scholarship seat*
*Visa Documentation Assistance*
*The Foster and Care throughout the course of an Edoofian*
29/01/24, 3:40 pm - Pallika Edoofa: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge due to which parents might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short period of 7 days and for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option wherein if the student is found eligible, instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, *parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days thereby reducing the financial pressure.*
29/01/24, 4:42 pm - +265 983 65 00 01: Understood
29/01/24, 8:42 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Samuel
29/01/24, 8:57 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
30/01/24, 9:32 am - Pallika Edoofa: Greetings,

*"With a dream, comes the potential for achievement."*

On this positive note, are we good to begin today's session?
30/01/24, 4:37 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Hello Samuel, I hope you are doing well.

Because of the high number of applications we have received for the 2024 & 2025 intake, Edoofa Academic Board has recommended all sincere higher education aspirants to proceed for the Eligibility Check Interviews, if you are one of these feel free to enquire about the eligibility criteria. 

In this large number of applications, I have identified you as a genuine higher education seeker, so it's recommended that you follow this instruction diligently.

Will you be able to complete the next step in the next 36 hours?
30/01/24, 4:37 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
31/01/24, 9:41 am - Pallika Edoofa: Good Morning,

*“If there is no struggle, there is no progress.” —Frederick Douglass*

On a positive note, I am here to begin our session
Are you ready?
31/01/24, 4:27 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Hi Samuel, I hope you are in good health.

I was hoping to connect with you and take your application forward to check your eligibility for the Edoofa Scholarship Program as we have discussed your application, but since you didn’t respond, I am afraid I will have to put your application on hold temporarily. However please Note by Thursday, I would have to submit my final response regarding your application, so failure to get back to me would mean cancellation of your application after which you would have to re-apply  

Feel free to connect with me again, when you think you are ready to proceed further. Below is a video explaining the details of the Edoofa Program

05/02/24, 2:13 pm - Pallika Edoofa: May I know the reason for the previous inactiveness, please?
05/02/24, 4:04 pm - +265 983 65 00 01: I went to my grandfather's funeral that's why I was inactive
05/02/24, 4:05 pm - +265 983 65 00 01: So I went to our village for burial.we had no network
05/02/24, 4:18 pm - Pallika Edoofa: please note that we currently have a high volume of applicants participating in one-on-one counseling sessions, and there is a queue of individuals awaiting their turn. However, as we have a limited number of available seats, it is crucial for you to actively engage in the session and follow through with the necessary steps to secure your spot.
05/02/24, 4:18 pm - Pallika Edoofa: So, Samuel, I can make a request on your behalf!
05/02/24, 4:19 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
05/02/24, 5:09 pm - +265 983 65 00 01: After going through the image we are on stage 02 Eligibility check test and interview
05/02/24, 5:24 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Well, Samuel,
We also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.

*Step 1:Connect with a counsellor-* As your counsellor, now we are going through the counselling process discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Edoofa Scholarship.                        

*Step 2:Eligibility Check-* The eligibility check includes the interviews with the Academic Board and Scholarship Test.

*Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa-* If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter.

*Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program-* This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.

We are left with steps 5 and 6.
So shall I explain them to you?
05/02/24, 6:30 pm - +265 983 65 00 01: Please explain them to me
05/02/24, 6:31 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Sure
05/02/24, 6:31 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 5:* After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors. They will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. will be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by paying the registration fee within a few weeks.

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education and the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).
05/02/24, 6:31 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 6:* Once you are done with the registration fee payment, you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.
 
I hope you are clear with the process.

5.the enrollment fee is ($500-$1000) the first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025.
6.Under Earn While You Learn, the students are required to put in extra hours after college in learning the important skills required to excel in their professional lives. When a student becomes a part of Edoofa, they graduatue with not just enough knowledge about their course but also learn how to put that knowledge into use professionally. Financial rewards notwithstanding, the Earn While You Learn Projects afford our students the opportunity for hands-on learning. While working on live industry projects, our students regularly interact with domain experts, making them well-versed with the industry dynamics. This helps them develop a sharp acumen, surpassing that of their peers pursuing normal higher education courses.
7.i am clear about the same.

4)The annual fee after the scholarship is $2000-$3000
Even though, the cost of education through the Edoofa Scholarship ranges from $2000-$3000 per annum, based on your performance in the eligibility check stage and evaluation of our Admissions team, you can be considered for a higher quantum of scholarship which can reduce the costs even below $2000 inclusive of tuition and living. <This message was edited>

06/02/24, 1:30 pm - +265 983 65 00 01: I understand
06/02/24, 1:30 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright!
06/02/24, 1:30 pm - Pallika Edoofa: @265999566911 @265888611718 you see as per my experience over the last couple of years, I have been fortunate to have assisted over hundreds of students in achieving their career aspiration through the Edoofa Program. 

One of my key observations during helping out these students was regarding what was the common trait amongst students who are today having the best of their time in India through the Edoofa Program, and honestly I was able to come down to only one aspect that is FAMILY SUPPORT.
06/02/24, 1:31 pm - Pallika Edoofa: You see in this journey of any child's higher education, there are three major contributors 

1. Student himself/herself
2. FAMILY
3. EDOOFA PROGAM

Now all the students who are today successfully a part of the Edoofa Program, had all these three contributors working together towards the common goal which is student's success and ensuring that by the time student completes his/her higher education they should be able to get good paying jobs. 

Even if any one of the contributor does not perform to the best of their abilities, Student's overall success is hampered. Let me give you a few examples

*In the event if student wishes to work hard, Edoofa is willing to support but the Family is not willing to support, the student will not be successful under the program*

*In the event if student wishes to work hard, Family is willing to support, but Edoofa's academic Board doesn't find the student worthy, the student will not be successful under the program*

*In the event if Family is willing to support, Edoofa's Academic Board is willing to support but the student doesn't wishes to work hard, then also the student will not be successful under the program*
06/02/24, 1:31 pm - Pallika Edoofa: During the evaluation of your child's application so far, the Academic Board has evaluated a few aspects, such as student's willingness to work hard, and family's willingness to support the student so that the student can achieve what he/she has aspired. However now in your interview ahead, the Academic Board would be strictly be evaluating the Family's support towards the child higher education. 

*As you know in the event if your child is found eligible, you would have to complete a certain part of the formalities within the 7 day timeline, so may I know regarding the same, are you willing to support your child to the fullest?*
