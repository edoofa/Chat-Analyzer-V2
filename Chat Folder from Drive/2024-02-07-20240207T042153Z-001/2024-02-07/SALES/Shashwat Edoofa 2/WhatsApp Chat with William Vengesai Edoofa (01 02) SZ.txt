06/02/24, 10:55 am - +263 78 284 8332: So it started when I was in form 3, I heard a friend who lived at an orphanage, he would tell me what he experienced and the living conditions that he was experiencing at that time, so I would always find a way to help him and also the guy was very intelligent. I always thought that they are many children of his age at that time who are very intelligent and they don’t have an opportunity to learn and be someone some day in life. That’s what ignited me to become a social worker and help such people in need
