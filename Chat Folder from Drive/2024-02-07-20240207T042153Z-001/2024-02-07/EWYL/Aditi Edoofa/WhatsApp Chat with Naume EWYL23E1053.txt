6/2/24, 1:33 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Well, I can see that there are some other people who have joined the group besides you. May I learn a little about each of them? I would appreciate it if we could engage in a quick conversation and get to know each other a bit.
6/2/24, 1:35 PM - +263 77 616 8836: Am Naume's sister.
6/2/24, 1:37 PM - +263 77 616 8836: We also make a conversation in place of our Father especially whenever he is busy like now
6/2/24, 1:39 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, and what about Naume?
6/2/24, 1:40 PM - +263 77 616 8836: She will be busy during the whole week only except for the weekend.She is at school now
6/2/24, 1:42 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, noted!
6/2/24, 1:42 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Thank you for introducing yourselves in such detail. Can you now share with me what are your long-term goals for Naume and how do you think this EWYL Program will help in achieving them?
6/2/24, 1:47 PM - +263 77 616 8836: Naume believes that when you facilitates her to proceed with education abroad she will surely be a great, diligent and strong legislative Lawyer of the world.
6/2/24, 1:50 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Naume's aspirations are truly admirable! Pursuing education abroad can indeed pave the way for her to become an exceptional legislative lawyer, known for her diligence and strength in advocating for justice on a global scale. With dedication and determination, there's no doubt she'll make significant contributions to the legal profession and beyond. Wishing her all the best on this promising journey ahead!
6/2/24, 1:53 PM - +263 77 616 8836: We still believe in you that you will assist her to fulfill her dreams.
6/2/24, 1:54 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Sure!
6/2/24, 1:54 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Moving ahead, I'd like to tell you about the *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
6/2/24, 1:59 PM - +263 77 616 8836: I think one of your goals is to ensure sure that high quality education offered not only education but only changes student's the standards of living as well but equiping them with sharp brains
6/2/24, 2:00 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
6/2/24, 2:00 PM - Aditi Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
6/2/24, 2:02 PM - +263 77 616 8836: Waal sound very great
6/2/24, 2:04 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
6/2/24, 2:05 PM - +263 77 616 8836: Ok Thank you so much.I am Ruth Sabiti.
6/2/24, 2:09 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Sure!
6/2/24, 2:09 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once *Naume* forms a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 05 minutes should be enough.
6/2/24, 2:10 PM - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
