So let's begin with our session🚀
25/1/24, 1:28 PM - +263 77 185 2421: Afternoon maam
25/1/24, 1:28 PM - +263 77 185 2421: Okay
25/1/24, 1:29 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Well, I can see that there is someone else who has joined the group besides you. May I learn a little about them? I would appreciate it if we could engage in a quick conversation and get to know each other a bit.
25/1/24, 1:29 PM - +263 77 185 2421: I am Phillis Chigonero
25/1/24, 1:30 PM - +263 77 185 2421: Anesu's sister
25/1/24, 1:44 PM - Aditi Edoofa: @263771852421 I extend a warm welcome to you for the exciting and incredible EWYL journey.
25/1/24, 1:45 PM - +263 77 185 2421: Thank you sir
25/1/24, 1:57 PM - Aditi Edoofa: So Anesu, I would like to begin this journey by knowing you beyond the _Statement of Purpose._ Can you share with me what are your long-term goals and how do you think this EWYL Program will help you in achieving them?
25/1/24, 2:01 PM - +263 77 185 2421: Anesu is at school right now so i will be responding on his behalf
25/1/24, 2:03 PM - +263 77 185 2421: His strength are mainly in the Arts side of the education. 

He wishes to study Law, and his long term goal is for him to be able to establish his own law firm and he strongly believes the EWYL programme will assist him in achieving this goal.
25/1/24, 2:06 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, sure!
25/1/24, 2:08 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the information about Anesu. It's great to know about his strengths in the Arts side of education. Pursuing a career in Law is a commendable choice, and I appreciate his ambitious long-term goal of establishing his own law firm.

The Earn While You Learn (EWYL) program indeed provides valuable opportunities for students to gain practical skills and financial support to pursue their academic goals. I'm confident that with his dedication and participation in the program, he'll make significant strides towards achieving his dream.
25/1/24, 2:08 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Moving ahead, I'd like to tell you about the *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
25/1/24, 2:11 PM - +263 77 185 2421: No sir. Please do explain the objectives
25/1/24, 2:17 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring that *Anesu* is prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach his professional goals.
25/1/24, 2:20 PM - +263 77 185 2421: Olryt understood
25/1/24, 2:22 PM - Aditi Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of the student’s tuition fees.
25/1/24, 2:25 PM - +263 77 185 2421: Understood
25/1/24, 2:30 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skillset through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
25/1/24, 2:32 PM - +263 77 185 2421: Noted sir. We appreciate their efforts in this journey
25/1/24, 2:36 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I wanted to inform you that tomorrow i.e. 26th January marks Indian Republic Day🇮🇳, a significant occasion celebrating the adoption of our nation's constitution. In observance of this special day, our institution will be closed tomorrow, and there will be no official activities.
Let's reconvene and continue our discussions on Monday🚀
25/1/24, 2:37 PM - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
25/1/24, 2:42 PM - +263 77 185 2421: Noted sir. Enjoy your holiday
25/1/24, 2:44 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Thank you, though I would like to mention that I am a female <This message was edited>
25/1/24, 3:01 PM - +263 77 185 2421: Ohhh 🙈 my apologies noted maam
25/1/24, 7:05 PM - +263 71 983 6130: Evening maam I was just going through today's conversation

I have read and understood everything thank u maam

Hope you are well.

That's amazing!
29/1/24, 1:35 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Embrace the new week with enthusiasm. Your attitude determines your direction, and your positive mindset can turn challenges into opportunities. Make this Monday a stepping stone to success!☀️

So are you ready for the session?🚀
29/1/24, 1:36 PM - +263 77 185 2421: Hello maam.
29/1/24, 1:36 PM - +263 77 185 2421: Yes i will be responding Anesu is at school
29/1/24, 1:38 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, noted!
29/1/24, 1:42 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates *Anesu* to connect with us over a minimum of 4 times a week the student will be having 2 sessions on either *Monday/Thursday* or *Tuesday/Friday*. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that the students practically execute what they learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
29/1/24, 1:43 PM - +263 77 185 2421: Okay noted
29/1/24, 1:49 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once *Anesu* forms a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 05 minutes should be enough. <This message was edited>

29/1/24, 2:05 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Indeed!

30/1/24, 1:57 PM - +263 77 185 2421: Thank you
30/1/24, 1:58 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how *Anesu* can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-
1. Give best in the projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss EWYL sessions without informing the mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share challenges and the things *Anesu* is good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make mentor trust the student fully
30/1/24, 1:58 PM - +263 77 185 2421: Okay okay noted
30/1/24, 2:02 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Moving towards the end, I wanted to take a few minutes to explain to you the different stages that Anesu has crossed in the complete journey of  being an Edoofian

30/1/24, 2:07 PM - Aditi Edoofa: After that, he was contacted by the_Admissions Officer_. I hope you are in contact with the admissions officer, so by now, you must be aware that all the admissions-related queries like _VISA process, Registration fees, AAL, etc. would be addressed/handled by the Admissions Team._

The mentor will be the closest point of contact who will help to build his personality along with a diversified skill set. All queries related to EWYL program will be addressed by the mentor.
30/1/24, 2:12 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Note: The EWYL mentor will not be addressing the admission queries
