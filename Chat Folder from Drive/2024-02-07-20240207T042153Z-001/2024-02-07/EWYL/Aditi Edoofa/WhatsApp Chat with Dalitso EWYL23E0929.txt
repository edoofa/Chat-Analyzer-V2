31/1/24, 8:40 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Yes, I am great. Thanks for asking.
31/1/24, 8:40 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Well, I can see that there are some other people who have joined the group besides you. May I learn a little about each of them? I would appreciate it if we could engage in a quick conversation and get to know each other a bit.
31/1/24, 8:47 AM - +265 999 95 37 21: Good morning
Myself and Dr Elizabeth Gomani Chindebvu are parents to Dalitso Chindebvu. The others must be your colleagues at Edoofa.
31/1/24, 8:55 AM - +265 999 96 51 01: Is there anything else you would like to know?
31/1/24, 8:56 AM - Aditi Edoofa: It's wonderful to connect with you. I extend a warm welcome to you for the exciting and incredible EWYL journey
31/1/24, 8:56 AM - Aditi Edoofa: I would like to begin this journey by knowing you beyond the _Statement of Purpose._ Can you share with me what are your long-term goals and how do you think this EWYL Program will help you in achieving them?
31/1/24, 9:02 AM - +265 999 96 51 01: My parents have always encouraged me to work hard so that I should not live a struggling life in the future. Thus my primary goal is to build a stable foundation that I can stand on while supporting those around me whenever I am needed. 

The EWYL program gives me the opportunity to learn interactive skills while building my connections with people. It also allows me to lessen the financial burden on my parents
31/1/24, 9:04 AM - Aditi Edoofa: It's truly commendable to have such a strong and supportive foundation from your parents. Your dedication to building a stable future and supporting those around you is inspiring. The Earn While You Learn program aligns perfectly with your goals, providing not only interactive skills but also easing the financial load on your parents. This dual benefit will undoubtedly contribute to your personal and professional growth. Wishing you success in your endeavors!
31/1/24, 9:04 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
31/1/24, 9:06 AM - +265 999 96 51 01: Thank you very much. I am looking forward to it.
31/1/24, 9:06 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Great! <This message was edited>
31/1/24, 9:06 AM - +265 999 96 51 01: I am not certain if I do know the objective, could you tell me more?
31/1/24, 9:07 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
31/1/24, 9:07 AM - Aditi Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
31/1/24, 9:11 AM - +265 999 96 51 01: I understand the objectives of the program
31/1/24, 9:14 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skillset through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
31/1/24, 9:16 AM - +265 999 96 51 01: Glad to get to know them. I am in your care and I am grateful for their time.
31/1/24, 9:19 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Awesome!
31/1/24, 9:19 AM - Aditi Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
31/1/24, 9:30 AM - +265 999 96 51 01: Yes, it does draw my interest a lot
31/1/24, 9:49 AM - Aditi Edoofa: So as the session time is over we are concluding our discussion, let's meet tomorrow for an engaging session🌟
31/1/24, 10:17 AM - +265 999 96 51 01: Thank you for you time today. Have a great day

1/2/24, 6:25 AM - +265 888 89 92 09: Good morning Ms Aditi
Please find herewith a swift copy of the payment for last instalment of Dalitso Chindebvu's registration.  Please confirm receipt of the same
1/2/24, 8:07 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Good Morning @265888899209 
Hope you are well.

That's great, I would recommend you to share it with Dalitso's admissions officer as well for moving the process further.
1/2/24, 8:28 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Let's begin with today's session🚀
1/2/24, 8:29 AM - +265 999 96 51 01: Good morning 
I am ready to proceed with today's session
1/2/24, 8:33 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Alright, that's amazing!!
1/2/24, 8:33 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 10 minutes should be enough.
1/2/24, 8:33 AM - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
1/2/24, 8:33 AM - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
1/2/24, 8:45 AM - +265 999 96 51 01: This is really mind opening and inspirational. The questions are  so deep and it let's one adjust their point of view
1/2/24, 8:45 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Amazing, did you notice the _Edoofa Hall of Inspiration_? I am sure you would one day want yourself to be celebrated in this section, the entire Student community reads this newsletter and it's a great deal to be mentioned by the founder himself, isn't it?
1/2/24, 8:47 AM - +265 999 96 51 01: It would be an honour.
1/2/24, 8:48 AM - Aditi Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound?
1/2/24, 8:50 AM - +265 999 96 51 01: This sounds fantastic.
1/2/24, 8:54 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Great, now I would like to ask you a few questions to understand how much from our discussion you could retain and if there is anything for us to discuss again.
1/2/24, 8:54 AM - Aditi Edoofa: So here are the questions, answer them in detail:

1. Share a small introduction of everyone on your  EWYL team.
2. What goals has your mentor set for your EWYL journey?
3. How does Mr. Angad Singh, founder of Edoofa, interact with all students?
A. Newsletter       B. Youtube

4. Explain in your own words what the Hall of Inspiration is.
1/2/24, 9:05 AM - +265 999 96 51 01: 1. My EWYL mentor is Ms. Adit, other members of the EWYL team include; the Head of the Department, Ms. Sanjana and the Head coach Ms. Davi

2. My mentor has set three goals for me; firstly, to ensure that my academic journey is great. Secondly, to provide me with enough opportunities to self-finance my higher education in India. Lastly, to help me learn and evolve with relevant 21st venture skills that will prepare me for the real world workplace and grow holistically.

3. Mr. Angad Singh interacts with the Edoofians through Newsletters

4. The hall of inspiration is where aspiring students who have shown brilliantly resulting or inspiring achievement share their stories so that they can motivate their fellow students.
1/2/24, 9:08 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Fantastic!
1/2/24, 9:08 AM - Aditi Edoofa: We’re ready to begin your EWYL program now, and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you.

6/2/24, 8:44 AM - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
6/2/24, 8:45 AM - +265 999 96 51 01: Very well
6/2/24, 8:51 AM - +265 999 96 51 01: I have listened to the audio and I have understood
6/2/24, 8:52 AM - +265 999 96 51 01: I am downloading the LinkedIn application now
6/2/24, 9:00 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, so very quickly-can you summarize whatever you learned in the audio for me? Just so we’re on the same page about it.
6/2/24, 9:04 AM - +265 999 96 51 01: Cooperate alliance I will gain an understanding of the market I will enter at an early stage have to connect Edoofa with Technology development and digital companies in my region. I can do this through family friends or LinkedIn app to get in contact with such companies.
6/2/24, 9:06 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Amazing, I’m happy with your understanding.
6/2/24, 9:06 AM - Aditi Edoofa: So, I am going to share an extremely significant document with you. Read it thoroughly as well as with careful details. I assure you- it’s as important as it sounds. After reading it, I want you to share what you understood from it. It helps me get a sense of how you’re learning with me!
6/2/24, 9:06 AM - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
6/2/24, 9:34 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Concluding our session, I want to say it's been an amazing conversation.
Have a good day!
6/2/24, 2:48 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Also, as I have been reading that there have been *reports of a potential cholera outbreak in the Malawi region recently*, so I wanted to reach out to make sure that you and your loved ones are safe and doing well.🩵

As our regular sessions are currently on hold, I wanted to take this opportunity to connect with you personally and express my concern.
6/2/24, 4:26 PM - +265 999 96 51 01: When searching for companies I should keep in mind of the nature of the company, it should be student-centric or recreational. The scale of the company, considering the number of employees the company has and it should be 50-200. The financial stability of the company. The background of the founder, the founder should have a solid background.

The recommended platforms to do all this are Google, LinkedIn, Crunchbase, Inc4media, Intershala or social media pages.
6/2/24, 4:28 PM - +265 999 96 51 01: We are taking necessary hygiene measure to ensure safety here
Thank you for showing concern
