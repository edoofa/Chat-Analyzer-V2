6/2/24, 8:27 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Hello Ashley, I hope you are doing well. 
I am *Ms. Aditi* and I will be your *EWYL mentor*.
I apologize for my absence as I wasn't feeling well and couldn't be online. 

So we will resume our session today onwards from 1:30 PM to 2:30 PM and your sessions will be held from Monday to Friday. 
No sessions will be held on Saturday and Sunday.
As now you are an Edoofian, being punctual should be an inherent trait and I hope that as the clock strikes 1:30, you come for the sessions for your fruitful EWYL Journey. <This message was edited>
