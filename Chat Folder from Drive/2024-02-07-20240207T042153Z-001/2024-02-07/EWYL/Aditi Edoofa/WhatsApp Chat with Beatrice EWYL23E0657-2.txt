I hope this message finds you and your family in good health and spirits. As I have been reading that there have been *reports of a potential cholera outbreak in the Zambia region recently*, so I wanted to reach out to make sure that you and your loved ones are safe and doing well.🩵

As our regular sessions are currently on hold, I wanted to take this opportunity to connect with you personally and express my concern.

We are well. Still in New Delhi recovering after surgery.
Regards
