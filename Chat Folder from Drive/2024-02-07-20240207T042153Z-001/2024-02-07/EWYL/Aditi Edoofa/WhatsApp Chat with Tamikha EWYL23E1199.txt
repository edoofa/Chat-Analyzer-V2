30/1/24, 8:54 AM - +263 71 214 7249: Thank you very much
30/1/24, 8:57 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Tamikha, I would like to begin this journey by knowing you beyond the _Statement of Purpose._ Can you share with me what are your long-term goals and how do you think this EWYL Program will help you in achieving them?
30/1/24, 9:09 AM - +263 71 214 7249: In the long term,l wish to succeed in my career and the EWYL Program will help as Edoofa helps Edoofians bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the Earn While You Learn Program.
It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that are equivalent to physical cash, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.The Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop more skills necessary.

The EWYL Program helps in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies and needs.
30/1/24, 9:14 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your long-term aspirations with me. It's wonderful to hear about your commitment to succeeding in your career.

Your understanding of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program and how it aligns with your goals is impressive. Edoofa's approach to making education more affordable through real-time live online projects and scholarship credits is indeed a valuable initiative.

The combination of gaining work experience, earning scholarship credits, and developing essential skills is a holistic approach that contributes to the overall growth of students. It's fantastic to see how the EWYL Program supports students in adapting to changing market strategies and needs.
30/1/24, 9:16 AM - +263 71 214 7249: You are welcome!
Thank you very much
30/1/24, 9:20 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
30/1/24, 9:21 AM - +263 71 214 7249: l have no idea about the two key objectives
30/1/24, 9:23 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
30/1/24, 9:24 AM - Aditi Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
30/1/24, 9:25 AM - +263 71 214 7249: okay, gotten
30/1/24, 9:25 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skillset through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
30/1/24, 9:27 AM - +263 71 214 7249: Thank you, it is great to know them
30/1/24, 9:27 AM - Aditi Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
30/1/24, 9:29 AM - +263 71 214 7249: Yes,very interesting
30/1/24, 9:29 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 10 minutes should be enough.

2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!

It is essentially a level of mental development or wisdom that has a bearing on all areas of an individual’s life, right from their conduct to their relationships with others'.

The nature of the company whereby it is student-centric , for example, career development platforms or it could be recreational for example, virtual gaming platforms and music apps.
Also ,the scale of the company where the scale of the selected company should not be either too big or too small.
Also,financial stablity where companies selected must be financially sound, checking the recent funding updates from various sources like Crunchbase.
There is also the background of the Founder which will be clear from his experience and background on the work.

There are also steps which keeps factors into consideration and at step 1 it is about searching, for example, one can search for start-up news and get links for various media platforms that update constant activities of all the start-ups. 
For step 2 ,after getting a few details about the nature of the company one may start studying a little.
