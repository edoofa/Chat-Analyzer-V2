Hope you are well.

I am *Ms. Aditi* and I will be your *EWYL mentor*.
I apologize for my absence as I wasn't feeling well and couldn't be online. Can you please share the above message again as I am unable to access it due to a technical glitch.

No sessions will be held on Saturday and Sunday.
As now you are an Edoofian, being punctual should be an inherent trait and I hope that as the clock strikes 8:30, you come for the sessions for your fruitful EWYL Journey.
