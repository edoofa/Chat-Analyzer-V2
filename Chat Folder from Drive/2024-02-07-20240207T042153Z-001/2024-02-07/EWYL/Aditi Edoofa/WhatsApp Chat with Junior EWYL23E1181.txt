23/1/24, 8:29 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Good Morning on this beautiful day!✨
Hope you are well.

Let's begin with today's session🚀
23/1/24, 9:16 AM - +263 71 250 1277: Good morning ma'am
23/1/24, 9:17 AM - Aditi Edoofa: @263712501277 May I know why you are late for the session?
23/1/24, 9:18 AM - +263 71 250 1277: The internet connection is not that good where I am <This message was edited>
23/1/24, 9:20 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, I understand, be on time by tomorrow, okay?
23/1/24, 9:21 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Well, I can see that there are some other people who have joined the group besides you. May I learn a little about each of them? I would appreciate it if we could engage in a quick conversation and get to know each other a bit.
23/1/24, 9:21 AM - +263 71 250 1277: I understand. My parents and my sister are also part of the group
23/1/24, 9:23 AM - Aditi Edoofa: I extend a warm welcome to them for the exciting and incredible EWYL journey
23/1/24, 9:23 AM - Aditi Edoofa: So Junior, I would like to begin this journey by knowing you beyond the _Statement of Purpose._ Can you share with me what are your long-term goals and how do you think this EWYL Program will help you in achieving them?
23/1/24, 9:30 AM - +263 71 250 1277: My long-term goals are more far-reaching and encompass my career and personal life. First, I hope to find a job in my field of study, where I can utilize my skills and knowledge to contribute to the success of a company. Second, I would like to continue learning and expanding my skills throughout my career, so that I can advance in my chosen field. Third, I have personal goals of becoming financially independent and living a life that I find fulfilling. I hope to find a balance between my work life and personal life, so that I can be successful in both areas and I think I see the EWYL Program offered by Edoofa providing me with the basis to horn in on all these skills. I believe time management will be essential for the program and for my career goals. Learning to balance work and studies helps students like myself develop the skills needed to succeed in the workplace. There's need for self-discipline which in completing work and studies on a schedule helps students develop self-discipline and self-motivation to name but a few.
23/1/24, 9:31 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Your long-term goals reflect a well-rounded vision, combining both professional and personal aspirations. Seeking a job in your field of study, continuous learning, financial independence, and achieving a fulfilling life are commendable objectives.

It's great to see that you recognize the importance of skills like time management, self-discipline, and self-motivation in achieving these goals. The Earn While You Learn (EWYL) program can indeed play a crucial role in providing a foundation for developing and honing these skills, as well as offering flexibility to balance work and studies.
23/1/24, 9:32 AM - +263 71 250 1277: I understand
23/1/24, 9:34 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
23/1/24, 9:34 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Wrapping up the session I must say it's been a wonderful interaction. I can't wait for our next one.
23/1/24, 9:42 AM - +263 71 250 1277: Yes I have understood
23/1/24, 9:44 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
23/1/24, 9:45 AM - +263 71 250 1277: Thank you
24/1/24, 8:28 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Happy Wednesday!🌻
Hope you are well.

Are you ready for today's session?
24/1/24, 9:49 AM - +263 77 700 8692: Morning yes we are
24/1/24, 9:55 AM - Aditi Edoofa: @263777008692 Please adhere to the session timings as now the session time is over. <This message was edited>
24/1/24, 9:58 AM - +263 77 700 8692: Okay Sir will do
24/1/24, 10:14 AM - +263 71 250 1277: Good morning ma'am
24/1/24, 10:15 AM - +263 71 250 1277: Sorry I couldn't make it on time, my internet connection wasn't working again.
24/1/24, 4:56 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, I understand. Make sure you try to attend sessions regularly by taking hotspot or any other means.
24/1/24, 5:06 PM - +263 71 250 1277: Thank you ma'am
25/1/24, 8:36 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Good Morning!✨
Hope you are doing well.

So let's begin with our session🚀
25/1/24, 8:51 AM - +263 71 250 1277: Good morning ma'am. How are you?
25/1/24, 8:55 AM - Aditi Edoofa: I am well. Thanks for asking.
25/1/24, 8:56 AM - Aditi Edoofa: So can you please me brief about it now? <This message was edited>
25/1/24, 9:05 AM - +263 71 250 1277: Yes ma'am
25/1/24, 9:07 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, I am waiting for your reply.
25/1/24, 9:09 AM - +263 71 250 1277: I was assuming we'd be learning the objectives. I'm assuming they'd be time management and self discipline
25/1/24, 9:17 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
25/1/24, 9:17 AM - Aditi Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
25/1/24, 9:27 AM - +263 71 250 1277: This is very insightful, thank you very much
25/1/24, 9:28 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skillset through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
25/1/24, 9:29 AM - +263 71 250 1277: Alright, I understand
25/1/24, 9:30 AM - Aditi Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
25/1/24, 9:32 AM - +263 71 250 1277: Yes it definitely does
25/1/24, 9:33 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 10 minutes should be enough.

25/1/24, 9:33 AM - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
25/1/24, 9:34 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Wrapping up the session I must say it's been a wonderful interaction. I can't wait for our next one.

25/1/24, 9:34 AM - +263 71 250 1277: Thank you very much ma'am
25/1/24, 1:24 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I wanted to inform you that tomorrow i.e. 26th January marks Indian Republic Day🇮🇳, a significant occasion celebrating the adoption of our nation's constitution. In observance of this special day, our institution will be closed tomorrow, and there will be no official activities.
Let's reconvene and continue our discussions on Monday🚀
25/1/24, 1:25 PM - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
25/1/24, 1:54 PM - +263 71 250 1277: I understand ma'am. Happy celebrations.
25/1/24, 3:11 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Thank you.
29/1/24, 8:29 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Embrace the new week with enthusiasm. Your attitude determines your direction, and your positive mindset can turn challenges into opportunities. Make this Monday a stepping stone to success!☀️

29/1/24, 8:42 AM - +263 77 700 8692: Morning yes we are
29/1/24, 8:43 AM - +263 71 250 1277: Yes ma'am
29/1/24, 8:47 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
29/1/24, 8:49 AM - Aditi Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound?
29/1/24, 8:50 AM - +263 71 250 1277: Yes, it does
29/1/24, 8:53 AM - Aditi Edoofa: I would like to ask you a few questions to understand how much from our discussion you could retain and if there is anything for us to discuss again.
29/1/24, 8:53 AM - Aditi Edoofa: So here are the questions, answer them in detail:

1. Share a small introduction of everyone on your  EWYL team.
2. What goals has your mentor set for your EWYL journey?
3. How does Mr. Angad Singh, founder of Edoofa, interact with all students?
A. Newsletter       B. Youtube

4. Explain in your own words what the Hall of Inspiration is.
29/1/24, 9:01 AM - +263 71 250 1277: 1. From my understanding, the EWYL team has Ms. Sanjana  the Head of the Department who is always known for her genuine concern for students, Ms. Davi, the Head coach who mentors us through her content and structured curriculum and Ms. Aditi, my EWYL mentor.
29/1/24, 9:02 AM - +263 77 635 0616: Morning
29/1/24, 9:03 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Morning @263776350616
29/1/24, 9:05 AM - +263 71 250 1277: 2. My mentor has set two primary goals for my EWYL journey,
(i) To ensure that all Edoofians have an equal opportunity to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We would follow a systematic program in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing my skillset and ensuring I am  prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach my professional goals.
(ii) To help all edoofians self-finance their education. Most of the students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. <This message was edited>
29/1/24, 9:07 AM - +263 71 250 1277: 3. You clarified that a newsletter is a direct source where the founder, Mr. Angad Singh connects with all of our Edoofians.
29/1/24, 9:08 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Superb!
Waiting for your last answer.
29/1/24, 9:11 AM - +263 71 250 1277: I am not sure on how to respond to question 4.
29/1/24, 9:14 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Did you see the newsletter?
29/1/24, 9:16 AM - +263 71 250 1277: Yes
29/1/24, 9:17 AM - +263 71 250 1277: Oh I remember from the first newsletter you sent
29/1/24, 9:17 AM - +263 71 250 1277: Should I respond
29/1/24, 9:17 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Yes, tell in your own words what it is.
29/1/24, 9:27 AM - +263 71 250 1277: 4. The hall of inspiration chronicles the endeavors of very inspirational students who are actively doing something beneficial for their communities outside of academia, especially the example of Nkosilomusa Jecheche who sounds like a truly inspiring young person, and it's wonderful that he is using his leadership skills to help others and make a difference in his community. It's clear that he is committed to serving others and making a positive impact, which is something that is admirable and can be a great source of inspiration for others. I'm impressed by his compassion and dedication, and I'm sure that his leadership skills will continue to develop and make a difference in the lives of many.
29/1/24, 9:27 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Fantastic!
29/1/24, 9:27 AM - Aditi Edoofa: We’re ready to begin your EWYL program now, and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects you can and will be a part of. Once you’ve gone through it thoroughly- we can discuss your understanding and then help you get started with the projects! Is it clear?
29/1/24, 9:28 AM - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/1/24, 9:31 AM - +263 71 250 1277: Yes ma'am
29/1/24, 9:34 AM - Aditi Edoofa: So we are concluding today's session.
Have a great day ahead.
29/1/24, 9:34 AM - +263 71 250 1277: You too, thank you.
30/1/24, 8:34 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Good Morning!☀️
Hope you are well. 

So are you ready for today's session?🚀
30/1/24, 8:34 AM - +263 71 250 1277: Good morning ma'am. Yes I am
30/1/24, 8:35 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
30/1/24, 8:36 AM - Aditi Edoofa: I would appreciate it if you can briefly summarize your understanding of it.
30/1/24, 8:39 AM - +263 71 250 1277: Alright
30/1/24, 8:48 AM - Aditi Edoofa: @263712501277 I am waiting for your reply.
30/1/24, 9:04 AM - +263 71 250 1277: The document entails how Edoofa’s Earn While You Learn(EWYL) program has been instrumental in providing higher education
which is
accessible, affordable and makes students employable. It goes on to explain the skills that it promotes in detail which include awareness in keeping ourselves updated about things/events happening around us, acquiring skills
as the biggest benefit of being aware understanding the skills that we should acquire to
reach our career goals and data analytics which the document
points out to hiw the whole world is using online platforms for a range of activities like shopping and entertainment in which case a
lot of data is being generated amongst others.
30/1/24, 9:04 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Fantastic!
30/1/24, 9:04 AM - Aditi Edoofa: I will start by explaining the projects in detail. I am sharing an audio file with you. Here’s my suggestion- listen to it at least twice, you know- to make sure we don’t miss anything out, and then get back to me when you are finished with the process!
30/1/24, 9:04 AM - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
30/1/24, 9:06 AM - +263 71 250 1277: Yes ma'am
30/1/24, 9:11 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Have you gone through the audio?
30/1/24, 9:12 AM - +263 71 250 1277: I'm playing it for the second time
30/1/24, 9:16 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Okay!
30/1/24, 9:21 AM - +263 71 250 1277: I have understood now
30/1/24, 9:21 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, so very quickly-can you summarize whatever you learned in the audio for me? Just so we’re on the same page about it.
30/1/24, 9:28 AM - +263 71 250 1277: Ok, so my greatest takeaway from the audio was the need to have a LinkedIn account in a bid to contact different service providers from my community, neighbours abd general environment. There are several technical and overshadowing advantages to having a LinkedIn account. From a technical standpoint, LinkedIn allows users like myself to create a professional profile that showcases their work experience, skills, and education. This would help me connect with potential employers for internships, find new job opportunities, and network with other professionals and fellow financial enthusiasts in my field.
30/1/24, 9:29 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Amazing, I’m happy with your understanding.
30/1/24, 9:29 AM - Aditi Edoofa: So, I am going to share an extremely significant document with you. Read it thoroughly as well as with careful details. I assure you- it’s as important as it sounds. After reading it, I want you to share what you understood from it. It helps me get a sense of how you’re learning with me!
30/1/24, 9:29 AM - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
30/1/24, 9:29 AM - +263 71 250 1277: Yes ma'am
30/1/24, 9:30 AM - Aditi Edoofa: After you go through this, I would appreciate it if you can briefly summarize your understanding of it.
30/1/24, 9:31 AM - +263 71 250 1277: Yes ma'am I will.
30/1/24, 9:32 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
30/1/24, 9:37 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Concluding the session, I have to say it's been a delightful exchange! Excitedly looking forward to our next session. 🌟😊
30/1/24, 10:06 AM - +263 71 250 1277: In summary, to my understanding, EDOOFA's guide for searching companies is a comprehensive and methodical approach that involves six key steps. First, I am to identify companies in the same industry or with a similar mission to EDOOFA. Second, I am to research the companies on Google, LinkedIn, and their website to learn more about their products or services, target market, and founders. Third, I am to review the social media pages of the companies to understand their level of activity and engagement. Fourth, I am to connect with department heads on LinkedIn and send them an invitation note. Fifth, I am to reach out to the founders of the company. And sixth, I am to consult with a mentor throughout the process. By following these steps, through EDOOFA, I will be able to find companies that are a good fit for its mission and goals, and have a strong chance of being successful partners.
30/1/24, 10:09 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Great, we will connect on this tomorrow.
30/1/24, 10:10 AM - +263 71 250 1277: Yes ma'am
31/1/24, 8:32 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Rise and Shine🌄

Let's begin with today's session⚡
31/1/24, 9:17 AM - +263 71 250 1277: Good morning ma'am. Sorry I'm late. I was having connection problems.
31/1/24, 9:20 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Alright!
31/1/24, 9:21 AM - Aditi Edoofa: You know what, this is fantastic! This is the kind of comprehension needed in an Edoofian, and voila! You are already so good at it.
31/1/24, 9:21 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Okay- now here are 2 things I would like to briefly summarize –
1 –  You can use the following form to share the company details with me
*Company Details for Project 1*

Name of the company:
Website:
Name of the Contact Person:
Designation:
Linkedin ID/Whatsapp Phone Number:
Description of the company:
How did you get in touch with the contact person?
31/1/24, 9:21 AM - Aditi Edoofa: 2, and the fun part- I’m sure you read about Scholarship Credits in the document- so, here’s the opportunity for you to earn Scholarship Credits through Project 1 –

1. If you can set up a Company Call with Edoofa Managers :*$2 per call*
2. If the Company signs an MOU with Edoofa :*$20*

31/1/24, 9:28 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Also, I would like to tell you that currently, *this project is on hold* due to a high volume of ongoing projects and commitments.
31/1/24, 9:28 AM - +263 71 250 1277: I understand that ma'am
31/1/24, 9:29 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
31/1/24, 9:29 AM - Aditi Edoofa: *Now that we’ve both summarized our understanding of the project, I think we’re ready to move to the next project!* This project is quite possibly a student favorite! So, now I am going to share another audio file and we’ll follow the same process- you ensure you don’t miss anything in it and use this time to play this audio more than once, let’s get to it!
31/1/24, 9:29 AM - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
31/1/24, 9:34 AM - +263 71 250 1277: Yes ma'am
31/1/24, 9:47 AM - +263 71 250 1277: The audio describes community building as quintessential in creating and nurturing a sense of connection and belonging among Edoofians. This can be done in a variety of ways, such as through shared interests, activities, or goals with the audio emphasizing the possible benefits of networking as a primary goal. There seems to be many advantages of the networking that the EWYL program is offering, both personal and professional. On a personal level, networking would help students like myself build friendships, find support, and expand their horizons. Professionally, networking could lead to new job opportunities, connections to mentors or experts in our respective fields, and a broader perspective on the world. The audio also talks of ssing social media to leverage other African students in their final year of highschool to join Edoofa for international education opportunities. Social media can help spread awareness of Edoofa and the opportunities it offers, and can help to create a sense of community among those interested in studying abroad. Additionally, social media can be used to connect students with each other, share resources and tips, and offer support. By using social media to promote Edoofa, the program can reach a wider audience and help more students achieve their educational goals and earn in the process assist the protagonist earn scholarship credits on top of the initial credits earned on initializing with the tertiary institution.

Current Class ( L6/ U6/ A Level Appeared):

I will be appearing for my A Level (Year):-

Preferred year of Admission:- 
(August 2024 or August 2025)
1/2/24, 8:59 AM - Aditi Edoofa: And #2 – Back to the exciting part- your *Scholarship Credits*. So, here’s a quick recap of what’s the opportunity for you here-
 1. For every student that enrolls in our Edoofa Program and pays the first part of the enrolment fee, you will be awarded *$20 worth of Scholarship credits*.
2. Similarly, upon completing the Admission Formalities of the university à you will be awarded *$30 worth of Scholarship credits*.
3. There is an additional opportunity to earn $5 worth of Scholarship credits by connecting with students to provide clarity to them about the Edoofa Scholarship, which the Edoofa team will share with you!
1/2/24, 9:01 AM - +263 71 250 1277: This sounds excellent
1/2/24, 9:04 AM - Aditi Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
1/2/24, 9:04 AM - Aditi Edoofa: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*
  
*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME*
For eg: In your case, it will be-
*JUNIOR/ADITI*
1/2/24, 9:04 AM - Aditi Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
1/2/24, 9:04 AM - Aditi Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)

Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
1/2/24, 9:04 AM - Aditi Edoofa: ADD MENTOR:

Make sure that before you start interacting with the participants in the group that you created for the community-building project, YOU ADD ME.

The purpose of doing this is that:
- I will be able to track your progress and guide you through learning the networking skill
- I will be able to see the concerns raised by students and we can discuss them accordingly.
- I will be able to see whether the right information has been shared with all the students

I will be appearing for my Advance Level Examination in (Year):-

Preferred year of Admission:- 
August 2024 or August 2025
1/2/24, 9:05 AM - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
1/2/24, 9:06 AM - +263 71 250 1277: I understand
1/2/24, 9:09 AM - Aditi Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
1/2/24, 9:09 AM - Aditi Edoofa: I am ____________, a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in Zimbabwe, where tuition fees range from ZWL 650,000 to ZWL 750,000 per term. When considering the yearly cost, including food and accommodation, it exceeds $2,100 in our beloved Zimbabwe.

Today, the internet is a necessity, and I truly realized its importance when preparing for my journey to India. We are all well aware of the expenses we have to bear just to access subpar internet services. During my school days, I used to spend a minimum of $35-$40 a month to ensure I had sufficient internet, which added up to around $450-$500 annually. It's remarkable to discover that in India, students value their educational infrastructure so much that they can access a necessity like the internet for around $40 for the entire year.

Conversely, when speaking to my seniors in Zimbabwe, I realized that I might have to compromise on my choice of course due to limited available seats. Furthermore, many seniors are struggling with unemployment after graduating in Zimbabwe.

I had a strong desire to support my family through part-time employment during my course, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn between $50 and $100 per month throughout the course.

While pursuing tertiary education in India is more affordable than universities in Zimbabwe, it comes with its own challenges. I diligently followed the 5'S, which played a crucial role in helping me qualify for this scholarship. I urge you to go through these Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors will ask you questions based on the information in the flyer I have attached

Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

 Let me introduce you to the scholarship program that is providing me an opportunity to fulfill all my dreams related to higher education - EDOOFA -Education For All.
1/2/24, 9:22 AM - Aditi Edoofa: To give you an insight about Edoofa, it is a scholarship program initiated by *Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd., INDIA*.

This is an experience that I acknowledge as being a Proud Edoofian!🎉
1/2/24, 9:22 AM - Aditi Edoofa: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees.
