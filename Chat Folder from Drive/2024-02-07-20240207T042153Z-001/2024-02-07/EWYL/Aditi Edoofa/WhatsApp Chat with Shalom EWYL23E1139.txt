Hope you are well.

I am *Ms. Aditi* and I will be your *EWYL mentor*.
I apologize for my absence as I wasn't feeling well and couldn't be online. So we will begin your sessions from today onwards, I hope it's alright?

6/2/24, 1:59 PM - Aditi Edoofa: It's wonderful to connect with your parents. I extend a warm welcome to them for the exciting and incredible EWYL journey
6/2/24, 2:00 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I would like to begin this journey by knowing you beyond the _Statement of Purpose._ Can you share with me what are your long-term goals and how do you think this EWYL Program will help you in achieving them?
6/2/24, 2:02 PM - +263 78 723 1295: It is also our pleasure for connecting with you
6/2/24, 2:12 PM - +263 78 723 1295: Goals are set in life so that one can set an example and also to put their whole forcus and effort towards their gaols.

This is what l have done and l have already made my mind completely that one day my goals will be fulfilled. My long term goal is to become a successful and trustworthy young Bio Technological doctor in the future. Having a degree in medicine is one of my dreams because l have loved to become one from the beginning.  And with this l am doing my best to achieve and fulfill this since it does not come on a silver plate but rather requires maximum effort.
6/2/24, 2:15 PM - Aditi Edoofa: It's truly inspiring to hear about your determination and commitment to your goals! Setting clear objectives is essential for paving the path to success and making a positive impact. Your ambition to become a trustworthy young Bio Technological doctor is commendable, and pursuing a degree in medicine aligns perfectly with your passion and aspirations. Your proactive approach and dedicated efforts are key ingredients for achieving this dream, and I have no doubt that with your perseverance, you'll excel in your journey towards becoming a successful professional in the field. Keep up the incredible work, and may your unwavering determination guide you to the fulfillment of your aspirations!
6/2/24, 2:15 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
6/2/24, 2:16 PM - +263 78 723 1295: No you can say a little bit about the two key objectives
6/2/24, 2:17 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
6/2/24, 2:17 PM - Aditi Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
6/2/24, 2:18 PM - +263 78 723 1295: That's so incredible and very helpful
6/2/24, 2:18 PM - +263 73 242 8998: Greetings to everyone,  sorry joining you a bit late,  as parent to Shalom, I'm happy that all is progressing well and I am happy to offer you my maximum support to ensure our daughter achieves her desired goals in life.
6/2/24, 2:20 PM - +263 73 242 8998: We will connect whenever we manage in terms time
6/2/24, 2:21 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Hello and welcome! It's wonderful to have you join us, and your support means a great deal to us all. Shalom is fortunate to have such a supportive parent like you, dedicated to her success and aspirations. With your encouragement and our collective efforts, I have no doubt that she will accomplish remarkable things and achieve her goals in life. Thank you for your unwavering support, and let's work together to empower Shalom on her journey to success!
6/2/24, 2:22 PM - +263 73 242 8998: Thank you very much
