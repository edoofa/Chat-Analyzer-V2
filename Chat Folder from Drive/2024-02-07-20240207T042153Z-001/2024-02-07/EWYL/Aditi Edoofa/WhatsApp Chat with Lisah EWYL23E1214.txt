So are you ready for today's session?🚀
30/1/24, 8:38 AM - +263 77 820 3688: Yes am ready
30/1/24, 8:45 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Well, I can see that there are some other people who have joined the group besides you. May I learn a little about each of them? I would appreciate it if we could engage in a quick conversation and get to know each other a bit.
30/1/24, 8:46 AM - +263 77 266 4290: Hello lam Lisah's mother
30/1/24, 8:49 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Greetings ma'am! It's wonderful to connect with you. I extend a warm welcome to you for the exciting and incredible EWYL journey
30/1/24, 8:51 AM - +263 77 266 4290: Thank you
30/1/24, 8:53 AM - Aditi Edoofa: @263778203688 I would like to begin this journey by knowing you beyond the _Statement of Purpose._ Can you share with me what are your long-term goals and how do you think this EWYL Program will help you in achieving them?
30/1/24, 9:09 AM - +263 77 820 3688: I want to work in government or policy, helping to create laws and policies that benefit the people of my country.  I have a strong sense of civic duty and a desire to serve the public.
30/1/24, 9:13 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your aspirations with me. It's truly commendable that you have a strong sense of civic duty and a desire to contribute to the well-being of your country by working in government or policy.

Your goal of helping to create laws and policies that benefit the people reflects a noble commitment to public service. Working in this field allows individuals to make a meaningful impact on society and contribute to positive change.

The Earn While You Learn program can be a valuable step toward achieving your career objectives. By providing financial support and opportunities for practical experience, it aligns well with your goals.
30/1/24, 9:17 AM - +263 77 820 3688: Oky
30/1/24, 9:20 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are? <This message was edited>
30/1/24, 9:22 AM - +263 77 820 3688: No can you please help
30/1/24, 9:25 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
30/1/24, 9:25 AM - Aditi Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
30/1/24, 9:28 AM - +263 77 820 3688: Thank you for understanding
30/1/24, 9:29 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skillset through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
30/1/24, 9:37 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Concluding the session, I have to say it's been a delightful exchange! Excitedly looking forward to our next session. 🌟😊
30/1/24, 9:38 AM - +263 77 820 3688: Thank you
30/1/24, 9:39 AM - +263 77 820 3688: Nice to know you Ms Sanjana and Ms Davi
30/1/24, 9:39 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Amazing!
30/1/24, 9:39 AM - +263 77 820 3688: Oky thank you
31/1/24, 8:29 AM - +263 77 820 3688: Good morning
31/1/24, 8:32 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Rise and Shine🌄
Hope you are doing well.

Let's begin with today's session⚡
31/1/24, 8:53 AM - +263 77 820 3688: Am doing well and you
31/1/24, 8:58 AM - Aditi Edoofa: I am well. Thanks for asking.
31/1/24, 8:58 AM - Aditi Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
31/1/24, 9:08 AM - +263 77 820 3688: Sound interesting
31/1/24, 9:09 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 10 minutes should be enough.

1/2/24, 8:46 AM - +263 77 820 3688: Thank you
1/2/24, 8:46 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Did you notice the _Edoofa Hall of Inspiration_? I am sure you would one day want yourself to be celebrated in this section, the entire Student community reads this newsletter and it's a great deal to be mentioned by the founder himself, isn't it?
1/2/24, 8:54 AM - +263 77 820 3688: Yes it is
1/2/24, 8:57 AM - Aditi Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound?
1/2/24, 9:02 AM - +263 77 820 3688: It really sound great. Thank you
1/2/24, 9:05 AM - Aditi Edoofa: I would like to ask you a few questions to understand how much from our discussion you could retain and if there is anything for us to discuss again.
1/2/24, 9:05 AM - Aditi Edoofa: So here are the questions, answer them in detail:

1. Share a small introduction of everyone on your  EWYL team.
2. What goals has your mentor set for your EWYL journey?
3. How does Mr. Angad Singh, founder of Edoofa, interact with all students?
A. Newsletter       B. Youtube

4. Explain in your own words what the Hall of Inspiration is.
1/2/24, 9:20 AM - +263 77 820 3688: 1.My EWYL team
*Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there.

3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that am learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare myself for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically
1/2/24, 9:26 AM - +263 77 820 3688: 3.A
1/2/24, 9:37 AM - +263 77 820 3688: 4. In my own words, the Hall of Inspiration could be a place where people can go to find stories, quotes, images, and other things that spark their imagination and inspire them to make a difference in the world. It could be a place to learn about great people who have made a positive impact, and to get ideas for how to make a difference yourself. Like what l have seen in the newsletter when the senior Edoofians shared their stories to us as fellow Edoofians.
1/2/24, 9:38 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Now that our session time is over. Let's connect tomorrow at the same time. Remember your dedication and regularity will help you excel in this journey! So, good luck and see you tomorrow!🚀
