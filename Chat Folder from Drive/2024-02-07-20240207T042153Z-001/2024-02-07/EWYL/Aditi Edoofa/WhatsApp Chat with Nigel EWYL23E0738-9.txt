6/1/24, 1:40 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Hello @263773112014 

I wanted to share some exciting news with all of you. As you may have noticed, my schedule has been quite packed lately due to work commitments. The reason behind this is something truly special – our team has organized a three-day long industrial visit called *SLICE CON' 24* for our Indian Edoofians! 🚀

During this event, *we are fortunate to have the Co-founders and CEOs of prominent brands* who will be present and sharing their invaluable experiences in one-on-one sessions. Yes, you read that right – they will be there live, right in front of us! What's even more thrilling is that a few of *our students are presenting a presentation directly to these CEOs*, showcasing why Africa, your homeland, is the best market for their products. 🤝
6/1/24, 1:40 PM - Aditi Edoofa: While I am filled with excitement for this event, please note that due to my involvement in the visit on the *8th, 9th, and 10th of January*, our regular sessions won't be taking place on these days. When we connect on the 11th of January, I'll share my students' experiences and pictures with you. 📸✨
9/1/24, 3:27 AM - +263 77 311 2014: Great then
11/1/24, 4:16 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Hellooooo!!!!

I quickly just wanted to share the scoop on *Slice Con'24—it was seriously awesome!* The event was nothing short of extraordinary, providing students with a wealth of exposure and valuable insights. 🚀
Throughout the event, students actively engaged with CEOs, asking insightful questions and gaining a deeper understanding of various industries. The *AI sessions* were particularly enlightening, offering a glimpse into the cutting-edge advancements in technology and some amazing AI Tools🤖

But wait, there's more! They also played games and made some great memories. It was a total win-win—fun and educational at the same time. Here is a glimpse of how it went, looking forward to when you will also get this chance to be here and experience these amazing things🤩❤️

23/1/24, 9:07 AM - Aditi Edoofa: *_🌟 URGENT UPDATE 🌟_*

Guess what? I'm super excited to share some awesome news – next month, we're planning a trip to Africa! 🌍 Yep, you heard it right! Our team is coming to your town. Just like last year, our students will be helping us organize the event, and we're looking for volunteers to join in and help manage everything! 🙌

Trust me, it will be an amazing experience with lots to learn! 🌈 Since planning this big event takes time and effort, our team will be so tight. 

In light of this, I'm proposing a slight adjustment to our session timetable. *Today, we won't be having our session as initially planned. However, worry not! I will soon share an updated timetable* and I am confident that together, we will create something truly extraordinary.
23/1/24, 9:09 AM - +263 77 311 2014: Great then. No problem I will be waiting for the update
23/1/24, 9:10 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Great!

*The AFRICA MEET AND GREET is HAPPENING this month,* and it's going to be massive – the biggest in Zimbabwe's history, with an expected crowd of 5000 people! Surprising, isn't it? Get ready for an unforgettable experience! 🌍🎉
This time it is bigger and better! Our Founder & CEO, Mr. Angad along with our team, admission officers, and counselors whom all of you have met behind the screens— are up to share priceless insights that will shape your next four years in India.
So, get ready for this epic adventure, and I'll share the details with you super soon! ⚡
1/2/24, 3:12 PM - Aditi Edoofa: *We'd like to reserve your seats in advance. Could you please let us know how many people you'll be coming with? This will help us allocate the right number of slots for you.💯*

I recommend bringing your parents and guardians to the event. They play a crucial role in your education decisions. This event offers them a chance to understand the program and witness the journeys of past students, providing valuable insights for your higher education journey in India.🇮🇳
1/2/24, 7:07 PM - +263 77 311 2014: Good evening Ms Aditi. I hope you are doing well.

I hope you're aware that here in Zimbabwe it's summer season and we are receiving heavy rains so sometimes network for going online might be poor I apologize for that.
1/2/24, 7:11 PM - +263 77 311 2014: That's very great to know that we are invited. Surely for me to provide you with information on how many of us are coming there I would like you to give me a clue on which week exactly are you expecting for this occasion so that I will tell my father to arrange his programs in oder which suits to be on that occasion. As you know my father is a Headmaster he will need to attend some meetings which are important which is hard for him not to attend.

But I am sure my mother and I will be there because it's not a big deal for my mother to attend it. <This message was edited>
6/2/24, 10:15 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Good Morning @263773112014
