20/1/24, 6:11 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Happy Saturday!🚀

This Saturday's activity is an exciting opportunity to delve deeper into the principles of the book 'Think and Grow Rich" by Napoleon Hill ' discussed in our Wednesday lesson. Each of you is required to elaborate on one of the seven principles shared in the Wednesday Lesson. Provide a detailed explanation, and don't forget to include examples to illustrate the practical application of the chosen principle.

This task is crucial as it will not only reinforce your understanding but also prepare you for our upcoming session with mentors. Remember, the more detailed and insightful your submission, the more enriching the discussion will be.

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or need clarification. Looking forward to your insightful contributions!✨
21/1/24, 6:14 AM - +91 72081 62024: Greetings mam,I didn't receive the Wednesday lessons since the day of Slice con up until now.
22/1/24, 9:27 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Good Morning!
Hope you are well.

Sure, let me share it with you now.
22/1/24, 9:28 AM - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
22/1/24, 9:28 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Here, it is.
22/1/24, 10:13 AM - +91 72081 62024: Okay, thank you so much for sharing.I will surely go through it.
22/1/24, 10:17 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Great
22/1/24, 7:38 PM - +91 72081 62024: The book"Think and grow rich"emphasizes on the principles of success and wealth.One of the principles that I am going to explain in detail is  persistence and resilience.Persistence means the quality that allows someone to continue doing something or trying to do something even though it is difficult or opposed by other people.This quality is very important as one continues to focus and do those tasks even when some people doubt and that leads to success in life.Resilience means the process and outcome of successfully adapting to difficult and challenging life experiences especially through mental, emotional and behavioral flexibility and adjustment to external and internal demands.This is also very important to achieve success in life.For example in the journey of university studies, persistence and resilience are important factors for a person to be able to pass and pursue the career that he or she would be wanting to pursue.
23/1/24, 9:49 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Good day!
Hope you are well.


Your focus on the principles of persistence and resilience from "Think and Grow Rich" is insightful. Persistence, the determination to continue despite difficulties or opposition, is indeed crucial for overcoming challenges and achieving success. Resilience, the ability to adapt and adjust to life's demands, further complements persistence, ensuring one can navigate through various experiences.

Your example of the university journey highlights how these qualities are vital in the pursuit of academic and career goals.
23/1/24, 9:50 AM - +91 72081 62024: Greetings mam, I'm very glad to hear this . Thank you so much 😊
24/1/24, 10:52 AM - Aditi Edoofa: 📌 Exciting News!

Edoofa's events and seminars are expanding, and soon, key members will visit various African countries to connect with students, offer career guidance, and collaborate with educators! 🌍 During the preparations, *our regular sessions will be on hold, but the DSW department will take charge and you will have sessions with them and make sure you stay connected with them for queries.* If needed, reach me through the EWYL Group, although my responses might be delayed due to my commitments. 

This Africa trip is not just a journey; it's a revolutionary experience for your juniors heading to India! 🚀
