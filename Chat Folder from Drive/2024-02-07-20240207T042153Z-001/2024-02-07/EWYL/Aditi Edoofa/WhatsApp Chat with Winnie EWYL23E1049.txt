24/1/24, 8:33 AM - +263 78 164 7225: Good morning ma’am yes I’m ready
24/1/24, 8:37 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
24/1/24, 8:37 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Well, I can see that there are some other people who have joined the group besides you. May I learn a little about each of them? I would appreciate it if we could engage in a quick conversation and get to know each other a bit.
24/1/24, 8:44 AM - +263 78 164 7225: I’m Pamela I’m Winnie’s mom
24/1/24, 8:45 AM - +263 78 164 7225: My Husband is also part of the group but he might not join us now because he is busy at work
24/1/24, 8:46 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Great to hear from you! It's wonderful to have both you and your husband associated with the group, even if he might not be able to join immediately due to work commitments. Looking forward to our interactions!
24/1/24, 8:46 AM - +263 78 164 7225: Thank you
24/1/24, 8:47 AM - +263 78 164 7225: Winnie is at school so Im mostly active in the group and I bring her up to speed whenever she is available
24/1/24, 8:48 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, great!
May I know her timings of the school?
24/1/24, 8:50 AM - +263 78 164 7225: She is in a boarding school so she get to use the phone after 4pm
24/1/24, 8:51 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, noted!
24/1/24, 8:51 AM - Aditi Edoofa: So moving ahead, I'd like to tell you about the *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
24/1/24, 8:53 AM - +263 78 164 7225: Please remind me
24/1/24, 8:53 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring that *Winnie* is prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach her professional goals.
24/1/24, 8:54 AM - Aditi Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of the student’s tuition fees.
24/1/24, 8:55 AM - +263 78 164 7225: I understand
24/1/24, 8:57 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
24/1/24, 8:57 AM - +263 78 164 7225: Thank you
24/1/24, 9:00 AM - Aditi Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates *Winnie* to connect with us over a minimum of 4 times a week the student will be having 2 sessions on either *Monday/Thursday* or *Tuesday/Friday*. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that the students practically execute what they learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
24/1/24, 9:03 AM - +263 78 164 7225: Noted
24/1/24, 9:05 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once *Winnie* forms a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 05 minutes should be enough.
24/1/24, 9:05 AM - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
24/1/24, 9:05 AM - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
24/1/24, 9:34 AM - +263 78 164 7225: Done
24/1/24, 9:35 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
24/1/24, 9:35 AM - Aditi Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the three goals I have set for myself for *Winnie's* EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that her academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure *Winnie* is given enough opportunities to self-finance higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that is learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare for the real-world workplace and grow holistically!
24/1/24, 9:36 AM - Aditi Edoofa: So we are wrapping up today's session. Have a great day ahead!✨
24/1/24, 9:39 AM - +263 78 164 7225: Thank you
24/1/24, 9:39 AM - +263 78 164 7225: Thank you so much and have a great day as well🌻

25/1/24, 8:40 AM - Aditi Edoofa: I am well. Thanks for asking.
25/1/24, 8:41 AM - Aditi Edoofa: For the most part of the EWYL journey, the students would work on three major projects to learn & earn as many scholarship credits as they can and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects that *Winnie* will be a part of. Let me know once you have gone through the same.
25/1/24, 8:42 AM - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
25/1/24, 9:34 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Wrapping up the session I must say it's been a wonderful interaction. I can't wait for our next one.
25/1/24, 9:37 AM - +263 78 164 7225: Thank you
25/1/24, 1:24 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I wanted to inform you that tomorrow i.e. 26th January marks Indian Republic Day🇮🇳, a significant occasion celebrating the adoption of our nation's constitution. In observance of this special day, our institution will be closed tomorrow, and there will be no official activities.
Let's reconvene and continue our discussions on Monday🚀
25/1/24, 1:24 PM - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
25/1/24, 1:42 PM - +263 78 164 7225: Thank you for letting me know

29/1/24, 8:29 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Embrace the new week with enthusiasm. Your attitude determines your direction, and your positive mindset can turn challenges into opportunities. Make this Monday a stepping stone to success!☀️

So are you ready for the session?🚀
29/1/24, 8:38 AM - +263 78 164 7225: Good morning ma’am 

Yes I’m ready
29/1/24, 8:41 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
29/1/24, 8:43 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how *Winnie* can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-
1. Give one's best in the projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss EWYL sessions without informing the mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share challenges and the things *Winnie* is good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make the mentor trust the student fully
29/1/24, 8:47 AM - +263 78 164 7225: Noted
29/1/24, 8:51 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Moving towards the end, I wanted to take a few minutes to explain to you the different stages that Winnie has crossed in the complete journey of  being an Edoofian
29/1/24, 8:52 AM - +263 78 164 7225: Okay
29/1/24, 8:53 AM - Aditi Edoofa: To have a clear understanding of the Edoofa program and the various points of contact that will be there. I would like to brief you about the roles of Counselor, Admission Officer, and EWYL Mentor.
29/1/24, 8:55 AM - Aditi Edoofa: The *counselor* is the first point of contact_ and has been guiding during the _onboarding process_ where she learned about the Edoofa program and the prerequisites to be a part of the same.
29/1/24, 8:58 AM - Aditi Edoofa: After that, she was contacted by the Admissions Officer. I hope you are in contact with the admissions officer, so by now, you must be aware that all admissions-related queries like _VISA process, Registration fees, AAL, etc. would be addressed/handled by the Admissions Team._
29/1/24, 8:58 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Finally, she will be starting the_EWYL journey with EWYL Mentor,_ where one gets the chance to learn *21st-century job skills* and *earn scholarship credits* which will ultimately help her to fund her higher education. The Mentor will be involved with the student at every step and will be guiding the way throughout the journey. The mentor will be the closest point of contact who will help to build her personality along with a diversified skill set. All queries related to EWYL program will be addressed by the mentor.
29/1/24, 9:00 AM - +263 78 164 7225: Noted
29/1/24, 9:01 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Note: The EWYL mentor will not be addressing the admission queries
29/1/24, 9:01 AM - Aditi Edoofa: I believe we are on the same page about the three points of contact and their roles. Feel free to reach out in case you have any queries.
29/1/24, 9:05 AM - +263 78 164 7225: We are on the same page. Thanks
29/1/24, 9:07 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Now, we have finally reached the end. I am extremely happy that you took out time to understand how Winnie's involvement in the EWYL program can bring her closer to reaching her career goals.
29/1/24, 9:34 AM - Aditi Edoofa: So we are concluding today's session.
Have a great day ahead.

So are you ready for today's session?🚀
30/1/24, 8:52 AM - +263 78 164 7225: Good morning ma’am. 

I’m well thanks hope you are well too
30/1/24, 8:52 AM - +263 78 164 7225: Yes I’m ready
30/1/24, 8:54 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
30/1/24, 8:54 AM - Aditi Edoofa: I am well. Thanks for asking.
30/1/24, 9:05 AM - +263 78 164 7225: You are welcome
30/1/24, 9:07 AM - Aditi Edoofa: May I know when will Winnie resume her EWYL Process and on which date?
30/1/24, 9:11 AM - +263 78 164 7225: I will let you know when I get a chance to reach her.
30/1/24, 9:16 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, sure!
30/1/24, 9:25 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Thank you so much for taking out time to complete these discussions, I really appreciate it.
30/1/24, 9:26 AM - Aditi Edoofa: As per our Academic Board terms, you need to draft a mail to Ms. Sanjana, Head of Department, and me stating that:
Greetings of the day,
I, <NAME>, from <SCHOOL> and Group name <EWYL GROUP NAME> won't be able to continue with my EWYL program till _ (date) because I am having my exams from _ to __ (date) and I will reach out to my mentor, Ms. Aditi as soon as I get over with my exams.
(Attach your date sheet along with this.)
Send it to - sanjana.edoofa@gmail.com, and aditii.edoofa@gmail.com, ewyl@edoofa.com
30/1/24, 9:28 AM - +263 78 164 7225: What is the date sheet?
30/1/24, 9:39 AM - Aditi Edoofa: You can add her school's schedule over there.
30/1/24, 9:55 AM - +263 78 164 7225: The boarding school she is at does not allow communication unless there is an emergency. I asked the school head if she could use her phone or laptop but they did not agree. The only access I have to her is through the matron’s phone. I will need to ask and make an appointment to talk to her. This is not allowed frequently. I seriously doubt they will share the school’s schedule.
30/1/24, 10:06 AM - Aditi Edoofa: No worries, in this case, you can just let me know when she will be back, and mention that date in the email and you can mention that she is in the boarding school.
30/1/24, 10:06 AM - +263 78 164 7225: Thank you
