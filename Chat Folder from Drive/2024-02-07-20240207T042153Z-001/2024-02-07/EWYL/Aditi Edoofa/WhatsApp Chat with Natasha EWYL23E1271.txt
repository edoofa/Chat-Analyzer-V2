6/2/24, 10:06 AM - Aditi Edoofa: So we will resume our session from 9th February, 24  onwards from *8:30 AM to 9:30 AM* and your sessions will be held from *Monday to Friday*.

As now you are an Edoofian, being punctual should be an inherent trait and I hope that as the clock strikes 8:30, you come for the sessions for your fruitful EWYL Journey.
