24/1/24, 4:27 PM - Aditi Edoofa: However, In the spirit of ensuring that your learning and growth never stop, I am sharing this Wednesday's lesson with you as I believe it's crucial to maintain the continuity of your education and growth. So, we'll delve into the impactful realm of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and computer technology in the context of saving lives. We'll explore how innovative solutions are leveraging these technologies to make a significant difference in healthcare.

Furthermore, we'll discuss a noteworthy case study involving a startup from Zambia that has effectively translated the concept of using AI and computer technology into practical applications for improving healthcare outcomes. I encourage you to read the provided PDF carefully, as it promises to open your mind to multiple opportunities within this dynamic field.

This lesson aims not only to broaden your understanding of the transformative potential of technology in healthcare but also to inspire you to explore ways you can contribute within your capacities.
