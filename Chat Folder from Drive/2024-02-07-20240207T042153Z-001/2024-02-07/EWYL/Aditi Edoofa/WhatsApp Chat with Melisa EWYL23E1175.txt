25/1/24, 8:56 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Well, I can see that there are some other people who have joined the group besides you. May I learn a little about each of them? I would appreciate it if we could engage in a quick conversation and get to know each other a bit.
25/1/24, 8:57 AM - +263 77 170 1656: @263772939466  that's my father
@263783770688 that's my mother
25/1/24, 9:05 AM - Aditi Edoofa: I extend a warm welcome to them for the exciting and incredible EWYL journey
25/1/24, 9:05 AM - Aditi Edoofa: I would like to begin this journey by knowing you beyond the _Statement of Purpose._ Can you share with me what are your long-term goals and how do you think this EWYL Program will help you in achieving them?
25/1/24, 9:12 AM - +263 77 170 1656: My long term goals include having a degree in business management and becoming one of the well known managers in my continent or world wide .
25/1/24, 9:18 AM - +263 77 170 1656: I think the EWYL program will help me  financially to pay my tuition Fee since my parents may find it difficult
25/1/24, 9:23 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your long-term goals! It's impressive that you aspire to have a degree in business management and become a well-known manager. The financial support provided by the EWYL program will indeed be valuable in helping you achieve these ambitions.
25/1/24, 9:23 AM - +263 77 170 1656: Thank you
25/1/24, 9:27 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
25/1/24, 9:28 AM - +263 77 170 1656: No l don't
Can you you give me a brief about the objectives
25/1/24, 9:29 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
25/1/24, 9:29 AM - Aditi Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
25/1/24, 9:32 AM - +263 77 170 1656: Okay I understand
Thank you
25/1/24, 9:34 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Wrapping up the session I must say it's been a wonderful interaction. I can't wait for our next one.
25/1/24, 9:36 AM - +263 77 170 1656: Thank you
I also can't wait for the next one I'm excited
25/1/24, 1:25 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I wanted to inform you that tomorrow i.e. 26th January marks Indian Republic Day🇮🇳, a significant occasion celebrating the adoption of our nation's constitution. In observance of this special day, our institution will be closed tomorrow, and there will be no official activities.
Let's reconvene and continue our discussions on Monday🚀
25/1/24, 1:25 PM - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
25/1/24, 5:48 PM - +263 77 170 1656: Okay

So are you ready for the session?🚀
29/1/24, 8:38 AM - +263 77 170 1656: @919625219934 
Good morning
29/1/24, 8:38 AM - +263 77 170 1656: Yes l am ready
29/1/24, 8:39 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
29/1/24, 8:39 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skillset through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
29/1/24, 8:39 AM - +263 77 170 1656: Sorry for the late reply my network was down
29/1/24, 8:41 AM - +263 77 170 1656: Okay thank you
Nice to meet you Ms.Sanjana and Ms.Davi
29/1/24, 8:45 AM - Aditi Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
29/1/24, 8:45 AM - +263 77 170 1656: Yes it does
29/1/24, 8:49 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 10 minutes should be enough.

29/1/24, 9:08 AM - +263 77 170 1656: Yes it is

It can also be a virtual showcase that shows municipalities  economic development agencies and property owners*
30/1/24, 9:19 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Melisa, I didn't want an answer that you copied from a website, so if you must have gone through the newsletter, you must have seen a section which we call as Hall of Inspiration.
30/1/24, 9:30 AM - +263 77 170 1656: It is when a real life situation inspired someone to be matured in life
30/1/24, 9:35 AM - Aditi Edoofa: It is the experiences of your fellow Edoofians who made a great impact in their course of work as Edoofians over the past years. And who had the privilege to be on the newsletter mentioned by Mr. Angad Singh.

These skills include *online/ digital skills and literacy*, *social media literacy* , *remote team work*  just to mention a few_And about project 1_

Additionally *skillsets*  *covered*  . This is about network skills, using professional networking websites like Linkedin and building confidence just to mention a few.

6/2/24, 8:49 AM - +263 77 170 1656: Thank you
6/2/24, 8:49 AM - +263 77 170 1656: Let me do as you say
6/2/24, 8:49 AM - Aditi Edoofa: And #2 – Back to the exciting part- your *Scholarship Credits*. So, here’s a quick recap of what’s the opportunity for you here-
 1. For every student that enrolls in our Edoofa Program and pays the first part of the enrolment fee, you will be awarded *$20 worth of Scholarship credits*.
2. Similarly, upon completing the Admission Formalities of the university à you will be awarded *$30 worth of Scholarship credits*.
3. There is an additional opportunity to earn $5 worth of Scholarship credits by connecting with students to provide clarity to them about the Edoofa Scholarship, which the Edoofa team will share with you!
6/2/24, 8:50 AM - +263 77 170 1656: Okay
6/2/24, 8:50 AM - Aditi Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
6/2/24, 8:50 AM - Aditi Edoofa: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*
  
*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME*
For eg: In your case, it will be-
*MELISA/ADITI*
6/2/24, 8:51 AM - +263 77 170 1656: Okay
6/2/24, 8:51 AM - +263 77 170 1656: So who is the mentor ?
6/2/24, 8:58 AM - Aditi Edoofa: I am your mentor, Melisa, you will just share the information in the group that you will create
6/2/24, 8:58 AM - Aditi Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
6/2/24, 8:58 AM - Aditi Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)

Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
6/2/24, 8:58 AM - Aditi Edoofa: ADD MENTOR:

Make sure that before you start interacting with the participants in the group that you created for the community-building project, YOU ADD ME.

The purpose of doing this is that:
- I will be able to track your progress and guide you through learning the networking skill
- I will be able to see the concerns raised by students and we can discuss them accordingly.
- I will be able to see whether the right information has been shared with all the students
6/2/24, 8:58 AM - +263 77 170 1656: Okay
6/2/24, 9:02 AM - +263 77 170 1656: Well understood
6/2/24, 9:05 AM - +263 77 170 1656: What about students who are done with their O-level
6/2/24, 9:07 AM - Aditi Edoofa: They can also be eligible for scholarships but only for DIPLOMA PROGRAMS. <This message was edited>

6/2/24, 9:13 AM - +263 77 170 1656: Okay
6/2/24, 9:14 AM - Aditi Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
6/2/24, 9:14 AM - Aditi Edoofa: I am ____________, a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in Zimbabwe, where tuition fees range from ZWL 650,000 to ZWL 750,000 per term. When considering the yearly cost, including food and accommodation, it exceeds $2,100 in our beloved Zimbabwe.

Today, the internet is a necessity, and I truly realized its importance when preparing for my journey to India. We are all well aware of the expenses we have to bear just to access subpar internet services. During my school days, I used to spend a minimum of $35-$40 a month to ensure I had sufficient internet, which added up to around $450-$500 annually. It's remarkable to discover that in India, students value their educational infrastructure so much that they can access a necessity like the internet for around $40 for the entire year.

Conversely, when speaking to my seniors in Zimbabwe, I realized that I might have to compromise on my choice of course due to limited available seats. Furthermore, many seniors are struggling with unemployment after graduating in Zimbabwe.

I had a strong desire to support my family through part-time employment during my course, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn between $50 and $100 per month throughout the course.

While pursuing tertiary education in India is more affordable than universities in Zimbabwe, it comes with its own challenges. I diligently followed the 5'S, which played a crucial role in helping me qualify for this scholarship. I urge you to go through these Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors will ask you questions based on the information in the flyer I have attached

Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

6/2/24, 9:19 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Along with this share the following information ABOUT Edoofa with them:

 Let me introduce you to the scholarship program that is providing me an opportunity to fulfill all my dreams related to higher education - EDOOFA -Education For All.
6/2/24, 9:19 AM - Aditi Edoofa: To give you an insight about Edoofa, it is a scholarship program initiated by *Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd., INDIA*. Edoofa believes quality education should be accessible to all and not just the privilege of a few. Through our scholarship program that is based on a work-study model, Edoofa solves both problems, that of *lack of affordability and of employability in higher education.* Edoofa stays with the students throughout their academic life as mentor and caretaker, right from building the application, applying to colleges, training, and making them job-ready. This is an experience that I acknowledge as being a Proud Edoofian!🎉
6/2/24, 9:19 AM - Aditi Edoofa: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, Edoofa has worked with 250+ Universities in India and has a community of *more than 3000 students* from different countries📍
 
Edoofa receives applications from _South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries_. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 2100 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just *affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven* so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains
