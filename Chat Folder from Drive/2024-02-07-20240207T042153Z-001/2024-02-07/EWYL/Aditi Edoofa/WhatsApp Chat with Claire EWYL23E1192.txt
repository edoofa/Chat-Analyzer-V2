25/1/24, 8:45 AM - Aditi Edoofa: OKay, sure!
25/1/24, 8:45 AM - Aditi Edoofa: I would like to begin this journey by knowing you beyond the _Statement of Purpose._ Can you share with me what are your long-term goals and how do you think this EWYL Program will help you in achieving them?
25/1/24, 8:47 AM - +263 77 684 2739: Sure
25/1/24, 9:03 AM - +263 77 684 2739: I want to be a  successful lab technician working in India.Also I want to gain an understanding of the sciences and to be a fast communicator and effective collaborator.
25/1/24, 9:04 AM - +263 77 684 2739: I also want to be independent
25/1/24, 9:05 AM - +263 77 684 2739: The EWYL program will help me in achieving these goals by giving me projects that will help me earn money hence teaching me to become independent.
25/1/24, 9:07 AM - +263 77 684 2739: Also I'll earn money through the EWYL program which will help me to pay part of my fees so that I can easily finish my course without having problems with finances
25/1/24, 9:09 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your aspirations! It's wonderful to hear about your goals of becoming a successful lab technician and gaining a deep understanding of the sciences. The EWYL program seems like an excellent opportunity to help you achieve these objectives. Earning money through projects and gaining financial independence, along with the support for your course fees, will undoubtedly contribute to your success.
25/1/24, 9:12 AM - +263 77 684 2739: Great
25/1/24, 9:20 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
25/1/24, 9:21 AM - +263 77 684 2739: No I don't understand
25/1/24, 9:26 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
25/1/24, 9:26 AM - Aditi Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
25/1/24, 9:28 AM - +263 77 684 2739: Okay
25/1/24, 9:29 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skillset through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
25/1/24, 9:29 AM - +263 77 684 2739: That's good
25/1/24, 9:30 AM - Aditi Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
25/1/24, 9:30 AM - +263 77 684 2739: It's good to know them
25/1/24, 9:32 AM - Aditi Edoofa: They are also honored to have you.
25/1/24, 9:32 AM - +263 77 684 2739: Very interesting
25/1/24, 9:33 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 10 minutes should be enough.

6/2/24, 8:50 AM - +263 77 684 2739: Okay
6/2/24, 8:51 AM - +263 77 684 2739: I'll do that
6/2/24, 8:57 AM - Aditi Edoofa: And #2 – Back to the exciting part- your *Scholarship Credits*. So, here’s a quick recap of what’s the opportunity for you here-
 1. For every student that enrolls in our Edoofa Program and pays the first part of the enrolment fee, you will be awarded *$20 worth of Scholarship credits*.
2. Similarly, upon completing the Admission Formalities of the university à you will be awarded *$30 worth of Scholarship credits*.
3. There is an additional opportunity to earn $5 worth of Scholarship credits by connecting with students to provide clarity to them about the Edoofa Scholarship, which the Edoofa team will share with you!
6/2/24, 8:59 AM - +263 77 684 2739: Noted😊
6/2/24, 9:04 AM - Aditi Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
6/2/24, 9:04 AM - Aditi Edoofa: -*A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*
  
*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME*
For eg: In your case, it will be-
*CLAIRE/ADITI*
6/2/24, 9:04 AM - Aditi Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
6/2/24, 9:05 AM - +263 77 684 2739: Okay
6/2/24, 9:06 AM - +263 77 684 2739: So I have to create that group now?
6/2/24, 9:08 AM - Aditi Edoofa: You can!
6/2/24, 9:08 AM - +263 77 684 2739: Okay
6/2/24, 9:09 AM - +263 77 684 2739: But I need to find applicants ryt?
6/2/24, 9:09 AM - +263 77 684 2739: Before creating
6/2/24, 9:09 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Yes, I hope you must have had some interested students, right?
6/2/24, 9:12 AM - +263 77 684 2739: I had them but all of them I directed them to Tanyaradzwa(your student) so I'll find other students
6/2/24, 9:13 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Okay!
6/2/24, 9:27 AM - Aditi Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)

Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
6/2/24, 9:27 AM - Aditi Edoofa: ADD MENTOR:

Make sure that before you start interacting with the participants in the group that you created for the community-building project, YOU ADD ME.

The purpose of doing this is that:
- I will be able to track your progress and guide you through learning the networking skill
- I will be able to see the concerns raised by students and we can discuss them accordingly.
- I will be able to see whether the right information has been shared with all the students
