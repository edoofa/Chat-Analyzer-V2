30/1/24, 1:36 PM - +263 71 257 4969: Okay mam
30/1/24, 1:39 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I would like to begin this journey by knowing you beyond the _Statement of Purpose._ Can you share with me what are your long-term goals and how do you think this EWYL Program will help you in achieving them?
30/1/24, 1:40 PM - +263 71 257 4969: Mam unfortunately my parents are unable to join us there are network issues
30/1/24, 1:40 PM - Aditi Edoofa: It's alright, they can join in till tomorrow.
30/1/24, 1:42 PM - +263 71 257 4969: my long terms goal is I want to be an entrepreneur and EWYL can help me archive it as through it we students get the chance to learn how to finance ourselves and also become financially independent
30/1/24, 1:43 PM - +263 71 257 4969: Yes mam
30/1/24, 1:45 PM - Aditi Edoofa: That's a fantastic long-term goal! Becoming an entrepreneur is a remarkable journey, and the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) program is indeed a great stepping stone. It provides you with practical insights into managing finances and achieving financial independence. I'm excited to see you embark on this path toward entrepreneurship! Keep up the enthusiasm and dedication. 🌟💼
30/1/24, 1:47 PM - +263 71 257 4969: Thank you mam I will work hard for my dedication
30/1/24, 1:49 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
30/1/24, 1:51 PM - +263 71 257 4969: Not quietly mam could you please explain the objectives to me
30/1/24, 1:53 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Sure, let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
30/1/24, 1:53 PM - Aditi Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
30/1/24, 1:55 PM - +263 71 257 4969: Thank you mam I have understood everything
30/1/24, 1:56 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skillset through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
30/1/24, 1:58 PM - +263 71 257 4969: Okay mam.I'm delighted to be part of this wonderful team it's really a pleasure
30/1/24, 1:59 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I am happy to hear that.
30/1/24, 1:59 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
30/1/24, 2:03 PM - +263 71 257 4969: Yes mam
30/1/24, 2:08 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 10 minutes should be enough.

30/1/24, 2:31 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Indeed! Did you notice the _Edoofa Hall of Inspiration_? I am sure you would one day want yourself to be celebrated in this section, the entire Student community reads this newsletter and it's a great deal to be mentioned by the founder himself, isn't it? <This message was edited>
30/1/24, 2:33 PM - +263 71 257 4969: Yes mam being mentioned by the founder himself is a great deal I also want to be celebrated like that
