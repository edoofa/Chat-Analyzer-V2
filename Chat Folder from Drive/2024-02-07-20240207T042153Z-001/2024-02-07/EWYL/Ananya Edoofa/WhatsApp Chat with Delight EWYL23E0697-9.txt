I understand and that is alright! Excellent job on submitting the form! I've promptly shared it with our highly dedicated counseling team. It's essential that you keep up consistent communication with the student and promptly attend to any questions or concerns they might have. Your proactive engagement will ensure a smooth process.
5/1/24, 7:11 PM - +263 78 769 7756: It's a pleasure to hear that. Thank you so much. I will do that accordingly
7/1/24, 10:01 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Delight!

I wanted to share some exciting news with all of you. As you may have noticed, my schedule has been quite packed lately due to work commitments. The reason behind this is something truly special – our team has organized a three-day long industrial visit called SLICE CON' 24 for our Indian Edoofians! 🚀

During this event, we are fortunate to have the Co-founders and CEOs of prominent brands who will be present and sharing their invaluable experiences in one-on-one sessions. Yes, you read that right – they will be there live, right in front of us! What's even more thrilling is that a few of our students are presenting a presentation directly to these CEOs, showcasing why Africa, your homeland, is the best market for their products. 🤝
7/1/24, 10:01 AM - Ananya Edoofa: While I am filled with excitement for this event, please note that due to my involvement in the visit on the 8th, 9th, and 10th of January, our regular sessions won't be taking place on these days. When we connect on the 11th of January, I'll share my students' experiences and pictures with you. 📸✨
7/1/24, 10:17 AM - +263 78 769 7756: Good morning Ms Ananya 💥

I hope that this message finds you well. Thank you so much for sharing this with me. It's really a pleasure for me to hear about about that🙏

I m so sorry that I couldn't make it for the EWYL program discussion. I was sent somewhere about more 15km away from home to fetch something for my parents. I just came back now on foot. I'm as well willing to connect with you tomorrow during the specified time
12/1/24, 12:00 PM - +263 78 769 7756: Greetings, Ms. Ananya, I am Delight Mudenda and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion.
12/1/24, 4:39 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Delight!

Please accept my apologies for the delayed response. I was engaged in our three-day-long industrial visit, SLICE-CON!
12/1/24, 4:39 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I wanted to share a few glimpses of the industrial visit, SLICE CON 24, that was going on for the last three days, especially for our Indian Edoofinas! You know, it was so happening, and I am happy to share that we also welcomed Mr. Peter Hobwani, Deputy Head of Mission and Head of Chancery, Embassy of the Republic of Zimbabwe to India.

Not only this, but during this event, we were fortunate to have the Co-founders and CEOs of prominent brands who presented and shared their invaluable experiences in one-on-one sessions. Yes, you read that right – they were there live, right in front of us! What's even more thrilling is that a few of our students presented directly to these CEOs, showcasing why Africa, your homeland, is the best market for their products.

Our students also enjoyed the 'Tech made easy' sessions, where we taught them to use new-age technological tools, including Artificial Intelligence. The sweetest part was that a few of our students even prepared a surprise performance for us as well. It was indeed an amazing experience. When you are here in India, we will also connect at such events.

In light of this, I'm proposing a slight adjustment to our session timetable. *Today, we won't be having our session as initially planned. However, worry not! I will soon share an updated timetable* and I am confident that together, we will create something truly extraordinary.

So, tell me, what is your progress? What are your plans to achieve the target of the month? Are you facing any challenges?
