2/2/24, 1:33 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Ruvimbo!

I hope you are doing well. Are you ready to begin today's session?
2/2/24, 1:34 PM - +263 78 062 8834: yes,I'm ready
2/2/24, 1:45 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Great! Before we proceed further, I'd love to get to know you better! Would you be willing to share a bit about yourself? Your hobbies, goals, and passions? <This message was edited>
2/2/24, 1:48 PM - +263 78 062 8834: As you already know I'm Ruvimbo Ashley Zimunya and I'm the first child in a family of three.I'm a sport person but I love volleyball more compared to other sporting activities.I'm also good at art and reading novels is part of my hobbie
2/2/24, 1:49 PM - +263 78 062 8834: I did my 'O' level at Hartzell High and my 'A' level at Marange High
2/2/24, 1:57 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Hello Ruvimbo Ashley Zimunya! It's wonderful to learn more about you. Being the first child in a family of three must come with its own set of responsibilities and joys. It's great that you have a passion for sports, particularly volleyball, and that you excel in art as well. Your interests in reading novels sound like a fantastic way to unwind and explore different worlds.
2/2/24, 2:00 PM - +263 78 062 8834: Yes I agree with you,being the first child comes with a set of responsibilities and a lot is expected from you.
2/2/24, 2:05 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Indeed!  Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
2/2/24, 2:11 PM - +263 78 062 8834: Yes a little but it will help if you explain further
2/2/24, 2:19 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
2/2/24, 2:19 PM - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
2/2/24, 2:25 PM - +263 78 062 8834: Well understood!
2/2/24, 2:31 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms. Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
2/2/24, 2:33 PM - +263 78 062 8834: I'm glad to know that the Head of the Department and the Head coach will be assisting throughout the program
2/2/24, 2:44 PM - +263 78 062 8834: Greetings Ms Sanjana and Ms Davi
2/2/24, 2:49 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Well, Ruvimbo, it was nice connecting with you today. I wish we could talk a bit more; however, since our session time is over, let's connect on Monday as we don't have sessions over the weekend!

Happy weekend!🚀
2/2/24, 2:49 PM - +263 78 062 8834: Thank you,stay blessed .
5/2/24, 1:28 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Ruvimbo!

Let us begin our session with an amazing fact! 

_*Did you know that a day on Venus is actually longer than a year on Venus? Even though it only takes Venus about 225 Earth days to go around the sun, it spins really slowly, taking about 243 Earth days to turn once on its axis. So, a day on Venus is longer than a whole year there! 🫨*_
5/2/24, 1:29 PM - +263 78 062 8834: hey ,how are you

I never knew😂
5/2/24, 1:36 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Well, now you know! Also, today I would also like you to be informed of our program structure that will happen after we discuss all our projects in depth (not now), which will mandate us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
5/2/24, 1:37 PM - +263 78 062 8834: that's okay with me
5/2/24, 1:44 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
5/2/24, 1:44 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
5/2/24, 2:06 PM - +263 78 062 8834: I'm done going through the news letter
5/2/24, 2:12 PM - Ananya Edoofa: So may I know which section from the newsletter you *liked the most*, personally for me, it is very difficult to tell, each section has its taste and interest.
5/2/24, 2:13 PM - +263 78 062 8834: the three sections were all amaizing though in different ways
5/2/24, 2:16 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Indeed! now,  I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound?
5/2/24, 2:17 PM - +263 78 062 8834: sounds really interesting!
5/2/24, 2:19 PM - Ananya Edoofa: We’re ready to begin your EWYL program now, and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects you can and will be a part of. Once you’ve gone through it thoroughly- we can discuss your understanding and then help you get started with the projects! Is that clear?
5/2/24, 2:19 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
5/2/24, 2:20 PM - +263 78 062 8834: Noted
5/2/24, 2:30 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Now that our session time is over, I want you to read the document carefully and share your understanding with me before our tomorrow's session. Good day! 🚀
5/2/24, 2:35 PM - +263 78 062 8834: Okay...stay blessed
6/2/24, 11:41 AM - +263 78 062 8834: Hello Ms Ananya,i hope you are doing fine.

I went through the EWYL projects pdf and I can say this programme requires a lot inorder to excell in it.
If I may ask,this task of identifying companies or an organisation as well as being able to reach the managers and communicate effectively with them,is it a group task or it it done as an individual
6/2/24, 1:32 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Ruvimbo!

How are you doing? Are you ready for your session?🚀
6/2/24, 1:33 PM - +263 78 062 8834: I'm ready
6/2/24, 1:40 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Well, I read your response, and I must appreciate your grasping power and obedience.
6/2/24, 1:43 PM - +263 78 062 8834: thank you
6/2/24, 1:49 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Today, I will start by explaining the projects in detail. I am sharing an audio file with you. Here’s my suggestion- listen to it at least twice, you know- to make sure we don’t miss anything out, and then get back to me when you are finished with the process!
6/2/24, 1:50 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
6/2/24, 2:02 PM - +263 78 062 8834: I'm  done listening to the audio
6/2/24, 2:05 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Okay, so very quickly you summarize whatever you learned in the audio for me? Just so we’re on the same page about it.
6/2/24, 2:16 PM - +263 78 062 8834: To start with ...in the audio he talked about corporate alliance which is the first project.This implies understanding the market I'll be working in as well as understanding it's aims.Also there is need to identify the companies in my region andbe able to tell them how Edoofa is helping shape my employability skills .
A linkeld account has to be opened where effective communication will be goin on between the managers and employees of the company and I .
6/2/24, 2:25 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Great! I’m happy with your understanding.
6/2/24, 2:26 PM - Ananya Edoofa: So, I am going to share an extremely significant document with you. Read it thoroughly as well as with careful details. I assure you- it’s as important as it sounds. After reading it, I want you to share what you understood from it. It helps me get a sense of how you’re learning with me!
6/2/24, 2:26 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
6/2/24, 2:30 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Well, now that our session time is over, let us connect in our next session which is tomorrow at the same time. 🚀
