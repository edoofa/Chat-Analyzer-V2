2/2/24, 2:05 PM - +263 71 416 7312: My name is Chipo Natalie Mugoniwa. Am from Zimbabwe. I wrote my form six last year and I obtained 7points while doing Pure Mathematics,Bussiness studies and Accounting . Well I have always been passionate about being a Chartered accountant. With my results I wasn't really satisfied about them but on the bright side it is a sign and opportunity of mine to keep on working hard in order to pursue my dreams to the maximum level with this scholarship. I am a hardworking girl aged 19 , through past events I can say I have leadership skills and teamwork skills as well . Am also good with computers as I have a nationally recognized certicate in my computer operations and packages in which I have a distinction. Amongst my goals I want to be successful, create a name for myself in society , I want to create my own firm and teach society about being Chartered accountants and mostly my parents I want to make them really proud by excelling in my academics and my country as well. 

In terms of hobbies I play netball and chess as well . Back in school I also participated in Quiz competitions as well. In conclusion it will be outmost honour for me to become a Chartered accountant with the help of the Eddofa program and the team as well
2/2/24, 2:11 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Hi Chipo Natalie Mugoniwa! Congratulations on your Form Six results and your ambition to become a Chartered Accountant. Your dedication is admirable, and your leadership and computer skills are valuable assets. Keep working hard towards your goals, and if you have any questions or need advice, feel free to ask. Best of luck on your journey!
2/2/24, 2:11 PM - +263 71 416 7312: Thank you so very much ma'am
2/2/24, 2:20 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Wonderful, my student! So, to kick things off with a bang, I wanted to share a fantastic video with you that I think will help us connect on a deeper level. Get ready to be inspired!
2/2/24, 2:20 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
2/2/24, 2:21 PM - +263 71 416 7312: Okay ma'am let me watch it
2/2/24, 2:24 PM - +263 71 416 7312: Wow thank you ma'am . Am also eager to walk this journey with you as my mentor and receive as much guidance I need in my journey to success
2/2/24, 2:30 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Great! Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
2/2/24, 2:31 PM - +263 71 416 7312: No I don't ma'am
2/2/24, 2:43 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
2/2/24, 2:44 PM - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
2/2/24, 2:48 PM - +263 71 416 7312: Understood ma'am
2/2/24, 2:48 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Well, Natalie, it was nice connecting with you today. I wish we could talk a bit more; however, since our session time is over, let's connect on Monday as we don't have sessions over the weekend!

Happy weekend!🚀
2/2/24, 2:49 PM - +263 71 416 7312: Thank you ma'am . Same applies
5/2/24, 1:28 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Natalie!

Let us begin our session with an amazing fact! 

_*Did you know that a day on Venus is actually longer than a year on Venus? Even though it only takes Venus about 225 Earth days to go around the sun, it spins really slowly, taking about 243 Earth days to turn once on its axis. So, a day on Venus is longer than a whole year there! 🫨*_
5/2/24, 1:29 PM - +263 71 416 7312: Good afternoon Ma'am . Thank you so very much
5/2/24, 1:36 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms. Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
5/2/24, 1:37 PM - +263 71 416 7312: Okay understood ma'am
5/2/24, 1:38 PM - +263 71 416 7312: It's nice getting to know the family whom will be with me throughout this journey
5/2/24, 1:44 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure that will happen after we discuss all our projects in depth (not now), which will mandate us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
5/2/24, 1:45 PM - +263 71 416 7312: Yes ma'am
5/2/24, 1:50 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
5/2/24, 1:50 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
5/2/24, 1:51 PM - +263 71 416 7312: Yes ma'am
5/2/24, 1:55 PM - +263 71 416 7312: Wow such an amazing newsletter I really enjoyed it ma'am and made me also eager to learn more
5/2/24, 2:00 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Amazing! At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound?
5/2/24, 2:01 PM - +263 71 416 7312: It sounds great ma'am
5/2/24, 2:07 PM - Ananya Edoofa: We’re ready to begin your EWYL program now, and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects you can and will be a part of. Once you’ve gone through it thoroughly- we can discuss your understanding and then help you get started with the projects! Is that clear?
5/2/24, 2:07 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
