Let us begin our session with an interesting fact!

*_Did you know that a group of flamingos is called a 'flamboyance.' So, just like the flamboyance of flamingos, let's add a touch of flair to our session today._*

Ready to soar into the world of curiosity?🦩
22/1/24, 8:33 AM - +263 78 289 6783: I am so ready ma'am.
22/1/24, 8:36 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Great! Now, before we proceed further, I'd love to get to know you better! Would you be willing to share a bit about yourself? Your hobbies, goals, and passions? <This message was edited>
22/1/24, 8:44 AM - +263 78 289 6783: Born and bred in the third capital city of Zimbabwe, Gweru as the third and youngest in a family of three girls, my name is Emilder Nyasha Makura. I am 18 years old. I recently sat for my final high school exams (Advanced Level) with Thornhill High School in which I passed with an A(5 points) in Heritage Studies, a B(4 points) in Literature in English and an E(1 point) in Geography. I studied both my O Level and A Level at Thornhill High School in Gweru, Zimbabwe. My hobbies are fashion designing, reading novels and writing short stories. I also like cooking. I loved playing sports at school, it was a wonderful work out routine. I belong to a nuclear family; my parents and 2 older sisters. My older sisters are both studying for their masters degrees. My father works for a co-operate called Montana Carswell Meats. My mother is an entrepreneur. My goal is to study law and go on to open my own firm one day. I also want to get a master's degree before I turn 30 and get a 6 figure salary annually before I am 30 too.
22/1/24, 8:48 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Wow, it's awesome to learn more about you! 🌟

Fashion designing, novel reading, short story writing, AND cooking? You've got quite the range of talents!
22/1/24, 8:48 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Living in a nuclear family with two ambitious sisters, a corporate dad, and an entrepreneurial mom - it sounds like a dynamic household! Best of luck with your goal to study law and open your own firm. That's some serious ambition, and I'm rooting for you to hit those milestones before 30! 💪 Keep shining, Emilder! 🌈✨
22/1/24, 8:49 AM - +263 78 289 6783: Well I also like photography, can I show you some of the pictures I have taken?
22/1/24, 8:51 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Definitely, Emilder! I am so excited!🚀
22/1/24, 8:52 AM - +263 78 289 6783: Thank you Ms Ananya😊my family really motivates me to be the better version of myself everytime, they have set a great example for me.
22/1/24, 8:54 AM - Ananya Edoofa: You are lucky to have a family like this, Emilder! 

We will together make them proud!🤝🏽

22/1/24, 8:59 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Well, I can see that some other people have joined the group besides you. May I learn a little about each of them? I would appreciate it if we could engage in a quick conversation and get to know each other a bit.
22/1/24, 9:02 AM - +263 78 289 6783: My parents joined the group also. I will let them introduce themselves.
22/1/24, 9:03 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Alright! Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
22/1/24, 9:06 AM - +263 77 353 2574: Hello Ananya ,I m Listen Makura , Emilder's mother
22/1/24, 9:07 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Mrs Makura! How are you doing?

22/1/24, 9:16 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Thank you so much for your kind words, @263773642468
22/1/24, 9:30 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Well, I wish we could connect for some more time; however, since our session time is over, let's reconvene in our next session, which is tomorrow at the same time.

It was so nice meeting and connecting with you all. See you next time!🌸
22/1/24, 9:31 AM - +263 77 364 2468: That's great. We thank you all for the great job. This is very encouraging
22/1/24, 9:32 AM - +263 78 289 6783: Okay ma'am, thank you so much for your time and dedication. Have a great day! Talk soon Ms Ananya!
22/1/24, 9:33 AM - +263 77 353 2574: Thank you ma'am
22/1/24, 9:47 AM - +263 77 364 2468: Thank you all. Good day.
23/1/24, 8:34 AM - +263 78 289 6783: Good morning ma'am.
23/1/24, 8:34 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Emilder!

How are you doing today? Are you ready for your session? <This message was edited>
23/1/24, 8:34 AM - +263 78 289 6783: Yes ma'am I am.
23/1/24, 8:50 AM - Ananya Edoofa: So, the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
23/1/24, 8:50 AM - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
23/1/24, 8:51 AM - +263 78 289 6783: Yes ma'am I understand
23/1/24, 8:52 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms. Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
23/1/24, 8:53 AM - +263 78 289 6783: It's a wonderful pleasure to meet you Ms Sanjana and Ms Davi.
23/1/24, 8:54 AM - Ananya Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure that will happen after we discuss all our projects in depth (not now), which will mandate us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
23/1/24, 8:55 AM - +263 78 289 6783: Very interesting ma'am
23/1/24, 8:57 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
23/1/24, 8:57 AM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/1/24, 8:59 AM - +263 78 289 6783: Thank you, let me go through it.
23/1/24, 9:13 AM - +263 78 289 6783: I am done reading ma'am
23/1/24, 9:22 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Great! So may I know which section from the newsletter you *liked the most*, personally for me, it is very difficult to tell, each section has its taste and interest.
23/1/24, 9:23 AM - +263 78 289 6783: The second paragraph from 3 questions for you was most inspiring for me!
23/1/24, 9:24 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Amazing! We’re ready to begin your EWYL program now, and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects you can and will be a part of. Once you’ve gone through it thoroughly- we can discuss your understanding and then help you get started with the projects! Is that clear?
23/1/24, 9:24 AM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/1/24, 9:25 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Since our session time is over, I want you to read the document and share your understanding with me before our next session, which is tomorrow.

I hope to see you tomorrow! Have a good day!
23/1/24, 9:25 AM - +263 78 289 6783: Yes ma'am it is
23/1/24, 9:26 AM - +263 78 289 6783: Thank you ma'am. Have an amazing day! Talk soon!
23/1/24, 9:58 AM - +263 77 353 2574: Thank you ma'am
24/1/24, 8:37 AM - +263 78 289 6783: Good morning ma'am.
24/1/24, 8:43 AM - Ananya Edoofa: *_“The journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step._”* - Lao Tzu

As we embark on today's session, let's remember that every small effort contributes to significant progress. Let's take that first step together and make the most out of our time. Ready to dive in? <This message was edited>
24/1/24, 8:44 AM - +263 78 289 6783: I am ready ma'am.
24/1/24, 8:45 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Lovely! So, did you get a chance to read the document?
24/1/24, 8:47 AM - +263 78 289 6783: Yes I went through it all Ms Ananya.
24/1/24, 8:47 AM - Ananya Edoofa: I want you to share your understanding of the document with me. I just want to ensure we don’t miss anything! So, please, go on sharing your understanding of the above document.
24/1/24, 8:53 AM - +263 77 364 2468: Good morning all. We are fine this side. Today, we woke up with some showers. Thanks for the above wise words.
24/1/24, 8:56 AM - +263 78 289 6783: I understood the skills I will acquire during the Earn While You Learn program. I also understood the activities that I will be doing to get scholarship credits.
24/1/24, 8:58 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Great!  I will start by explaining the projects in detail. I am sharing an audio file with you. Here’s my suggestion- listen to it at least twice, you know- to make sure we don’t miss anything out, and then get back to me when you are finished with the process!
24/1/24, 8:58 AM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
24/1/24, 9:05 AM - +263 78 289 6783: I am done ma'am.
24/1/24, 9:08 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Okay, so very quickly you summarize whatever you learned in the audio for me? Just so we’re on the same page about it.
24/1/24, 9:10 AM - +263 78 289 6783: I learned the benefits of doing the Earn While You Learn program and how to connect with people. <This message was edited>
24/1/24, 9:10 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Alright! So, I am going to share an extremely significant document with you. Read it thoroughly as well as with careful details. I assure you- it’s as important as it sounds. After reading it, I want you to share what you understood from it. It helps me get a sense of how you’re learning with me!
24/1/24, 9:11 AM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
24/1/24, 9:23 AM - +263 78 289 6783: I am done ma'am. The document shares advice on how I can search for companies to connect with. The document shares how I can find them on Google and LinkedIn.
24/1/24, 9:27 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Okay- now here are 2 things I would like to briefly summarize –
1 –  You can use the following form to share the company details with me
*Company Details for Project 1*

24/1/24, 9:27 AM - Ananya Edoofa: 2, and the fun part- I’m sure you read about Scholarship Credits in the document- so, here’s the opportunity for you to earn Scholarship Credits through Project 1 –

1. If you can set up a Company Call with Edoofa Managers : *$2 per call*
2. If the Company signs an MOU with Edoofa : *$20*

24/1/24, 9:30 AM - Ananya Edoofa: *Now that we’ve both summarized our understanding of the project, I think we’re ready to move to the next project!* This project is quite possibly a student favorite! So, now I am going to share another audio file and we’ll follow the same process- you ensure you don’t miss anything in it and use this time to play this audio more than once, let’s get to it !
24/1/24, 9:31 AM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
24/1/24, 9:33 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Before we wrap up, here's a quick joke to add a smile to your day:

Why don't scientists trust atoms?

Because they make up everything!

Thank you all for a great session. Remember, laughter is the best medicine. Until next time!🚀
24/1/24, 9:35 AM - +263 78 289 6783: I understood the audio and how to do the second project of helping more students enroll into the Edoofa Scholarship program

25/1/24, 8:35 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Emilder!

Let us begin our session with a fun fact: 

The tongue of a blue whale, the largest animal on Earth, can weigh as much as an elephant. Despite their massive size, blue whales primarily feed on tiny shrimp-like animals called krill, using their enormous tongues to filter them from the water.🐋
25/1/24, 8:37 AM - +263 78 289 6783: I didn't know it was as heavy as an elephant that's interesting ma'am.
25/1/24, 8:40 AM - Ananya Edoofa: That’s awesome, I’m confident that if you continue to pay attention to the information shared and then respond accordingly, we will make a great team. Now, here are 2 things I’d like to briefly remind you of from the Community Building Project.
25/1/24, 8:40 AM - Ananya Edoofa: 1-  I’m sharing a form with you below, you can share that with the students whom you speak with and think that they truly deserve to be an Edoofian and fulfill their dreams of higher education!

Subject Combination in A Level:-
Current Class (L5 / L6 / U6):

I will be appearing for my Advance Level Examination in (Year):-

Preferred year of Admission:- 
August 2024 or August 2025
25/1/24, 8:41 AM - +263 78 289 6783: I will definitely do that ma'am! Let's grow the Edoofa community right!
25/1/24, 8:54 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Absolutely! And #2 – Back to the exciting part- your *Scholarship Credits*. So, here’s a quick recap of what’s the opportunity for you here-
 1. For every student that enrolls in our Edoofa Program and pays the first part of the enrolment fee, you will be awarded *$20 worth of Scholarship credits*.
2. Similarly, upon completing the Admission Formalities of the university à you will be awarded *$30 worth of Scholarship credits*.
3. There is an additional opportunity to earn $5 worth of Scholarship credits by connecting with students to provide clarity to them about the Edoofa Scholarship, which the Edoofa team will share with you!
25/1/24, 8:55 AM - +263 78 289 6783: Okay I understand ma'am!
25/1/24, 8:59 AM - Ananya Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
25/1/24, 9:00 AM - Ananya Edoofa: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*

*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED*
25/1/24, 9:00 AM - Ananya Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
25/1/24, 9:00 AM - Ananya Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)
25/1/24, 9:00 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Once they add you there, you can share the link to YOUR WhatsApp Group (that you created in the first step) and tell them that on that group you will be sharing information about an exciting opportunity where they get a chance to pursue your education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on the tuition fee. To know more, please get added to the group.
25/1/24, 9:00 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
25/1/24, 9:00 AM - Ananya Edoofa: 2] ADD MENTOR:

Make sure that before you start interacting with the participants in the group that you created for the community-building project, YOU ADD ME.

The purpose of doing this is that:
- I will be able to track your progress and guide you through learning the networking skill
- I will be able to see the concerns raised by students and we can discuss them accordingly.
- I will be able to see whether the right information has been shared with all the students

25/1/24, 9:02 AM - +263 78 289 6783: I understand ma'am
25/1/24, 9:21 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for the delayed response; I am facing some technical glitches.
25/1/24, 9:22 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, in order to move ahead with your second project, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
25/1/24, 9:22 AM - Ananya Edoofa: I am ____________, a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in *Zimbabwe*, where tuition fees range from ZWL 650,000 to ZWL 750,000 per term. When considering the yearly cost, including food and accommodation, it exceeds $2,100 in our beloved Zimbabwe⏫

Today, the internet is a necessity, and I truly realized its importance when preparing for my journey to India. We are all well aware of the expenses we have to bear just to access subpar internet services. During my school days, I used to spend a minimum of $35-$40 a month to ensure I had sufficient internet, which added up to around $450-$500 annually.
*It's remarkable to discover that in India, students value their educational infrastructure so much that they can access a necessity like the internet for around $40 for the entire year.*💥
Conversely, when speaking to my seniors in Zimbabwe, I realized that I might have to compromise on my choice of course due to limited available seats. Furthermore, many seniors are struggling with unemployment after graduating in Zimbabwe
I had a strong desire to support my family through part-time employment during my course, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn between $50 and $100 per month throughout the course.
*While pursuing tertiary education in India is more affordable than universities in Zimbabwe, it comes with its own challenges. I diligently followed the 5S, which played a crucial role in helping me qualify for this scholarship. I urge you to go through these Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors will ask you questions based on the information in the flyer I have attached*
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5s of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!
