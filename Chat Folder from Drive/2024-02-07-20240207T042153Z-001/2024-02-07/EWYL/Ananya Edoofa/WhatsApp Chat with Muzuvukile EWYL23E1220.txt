5/2/24, 8:32 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Muzuvukile!

Let us begin our session with an amazing fact! 

_*Did you know that a day on Venus is actually longer than a year on Venus? Even though it only takes Venus about 225 Earth days to go around the sun, it spins really slowly, taking about 243 Earth days to turn once on its axis. So, a day on Venus is longer than a whole year there!*_ 🫨
5/2/24, 8:33 AM - +263 71 968 2002: Good morning ma'am
This is a mind blowing fact 
Really amazing
5/2/24, 8:35 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Now, before we move forward I would like to know more about you!
Would you like to share a quick introduction?
5/2/24, 8:42 AM - +263 71 968 2002: Okay ma'am

My full name is Muzuvukile Nelson Siwela,i am 18 years old.I am settled in Zimbabwe, Bulawayo.I recently completed my A leve education at Mpopoma high school. I come from a family of 4 which are Mother ,Father ,young sister and I .I play a trumpet as my hobby and i also enjoy playing football. I love learning new things and sharing the things i learn .

Thank you .
5/2/24, 8:48 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Wow! Playing the trumpet and football, that's a diverse set of interests! Do you have any favorite songs to play on the trumpet or a favorite football team?
5/2/24, 8:50 AM - +263 71 968 2002: Yes ma'am, my favorite song on the trumpet is "Here i an to worship " by Micheal W Smith 

And my favourite football team is Arsenal Football Club
5/2/24, 8:51 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Lovely, Muzuvukile! Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
5/2/24, 8:53 AM - +263 71 968 2002: No ma'am,please share them with me
5/2/24, 8:53 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms. Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
5/2/24, 8:54 AM - +263 71 968 2002: Noted ma'am
5/2/24, 8:54 AM - Ananya Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure that will happen after we discuss all our projects in depth (not now), which will mandate us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
5/2/24, 8:56 AM - +263 71 968 2002: Very interesting ma'am
5/2/24, 8:58 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
5/2/24, 8:58 AM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
5/2/24, 9:10 AM - +263 71 968 2002: I am done with the news letter ma'am
5/2/24, 9:11 AM - Ananya Edoofa: So may I know which section from the newsletter you *liked the most*, personally for me, it is very difficult to tell, each section has its taste and interest.
5/2/24, 9:14 AM - +263 71 968 2002: I agree with you 
I really felt motivated as i read through the Edoofa hall of inspiration
5/2/24, 9:15 AM - Ananya Edoofa: I am sure you would one day want yourself to be celebrated in this section, the entire Student community reads this newsletter and it's a great deal to be mentioned by the founder himself, isn't it?
5/2/24, 9:16 AM - +263 71 968 2002: Its very very great ma'am
5/2/24, 9:18 AM - Ananya Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound?
5/2/24, 9:20 AM - +263 71 968 2002: I love the sound of that , ma'am
5/2/24, 9:20 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Now, We’re ready to begin your EWYL program now, and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you.
