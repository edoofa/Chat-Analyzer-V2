27/12/23, 4:09 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good evening, Covenant!

I wanted to express my disappointment upon realizing that my last message went unanswered, specifically the question I posed at the end.

I provided you with a holiday to facilitate a focused and stress-free environment for your exams. However, I can't help but feel disheartened that a simple question seems to have been overlooked. I understand the demands of this period, but a basic acknowledgment or response would have sufficed.

It's a small but important detail that will contribute to your success. Is this not important to you?
27/12/23, 4:11 PM - +91 79019 93590: Which message Ma'am?

29/12/23, 4:07 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good evening, Covenant!

yes!
29/12/23, 4:10 PM - +91 79019 93590: Evening Ma'am, Ok but I thought had answered  that when I said that

I plan to share the various opportunities like internships, webinars and exposure to my students

Some agree to pay the admissions fees and I submit the forms here. But I never let an opportunity of enrolling a student pass.I do whatever possible to get as many quality forms possible😊 <This message was edited>

19/1/24, 3:54 PM - +91 79019 93590: There are some desperate situations which I need your help Ma'am. One example is the following issue.Some of my friends like Wilbert Mushati, Enockson Chivhoko I have submitted their forms last year  around June. They  were in upper six. They didn't not complete their application then they dropped out. When I came here they were now sure the program is genuine and exists , they started to keep in contact with me on whatsapp and started showing great interest in the Edoofa, I then asked them if they wanted to countinue with application process. They said yes and I submitted their names to you. Again that time they dropped out of the application saying their A level results were not out yet. They were waiting to complete A level get results first. They continued to ask many how I'm living, expenses, religion etc , I answered everything politely. Now the results are out. They are saying they are now ready to come to India. I don't know what I should tell him to make sure they do not register into Edoofa through other students already here or in Zimbabwe but to continue with me such that all my patience won't be for nothing. 
And I think they can be real quality forms.. <This message was edited>
19/1/24, 4:04 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Understood, Covenant! Can you share their forms again?

24/1/24, 2:55 PM - Ananya Edoofa: *Wednesday Lesson*

In today's Wednesday lesson, we'll delve into the impactful realm of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and computer technology in the context of saving lives. We'll explore how innovative solutions are leveraging these technologies to make a significant difference in healthcare.

Furthermore, we'll discuss a noteworthy case study involving a startup from Zambia that has effectively translated the concept of using AI and computer technology into practical applications for improving healthcare outcomes. I encourage you to read the provided PDF carefully, as it promises to open your mind to multiple opportunities within this dynamic field.

This lesson aims not only to broaden your understanding of the transformative potential of technology in healthcare but also to inspire you to explore ways you can contribute within your capacities. Feel free to come prepared with questions and ideas for a lively and engaging discussion.

Looking forward to an enlightening session!
