What does AI mean for health care:

This predictive capability enables Healthcare providers to offer proactive and preventive care ultimately leading to better patient outcomes and reduced Healthcare costs. 

We can leverage AI in Healthcare by analyzing historical data, AI can predict disease outbreaks, patients Admission rates and resource requirements.  Providers should adopt AI based analytic tools to optimize resource allocation and improve patient outcomes. AI provides opportunities to help reduce human error, assist medical professionals and staff and provide patient services 24/7. As AI tools continue to develop  there is potential to use AI even more in reading medical images , X Rays and scans, diagnosing medical problems and creating treatment plans.
