I'm now ready for today's session
2/2/24, 1:46 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Anesu!

I hope you are doing well. Are you ready to begin today's session?
2/2/24, 1:47 PM - +263 71 658 2805: I'm doing well 
Yes I'm ready
2/2/24, 1:56 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Before we proceed further, I'd love to get to know you better! Would you be willing to share a bit about yourself? Your hobbies, goals, and passions?
2/2/24, 2:01 PM - +263 71 658 2805: Well....I love watching movies and  listening to music and dancing too.My goal is to be a Software engineer in the near future.Ive got passion in coding and programming
2/2/24, 2:05 PM - Ananya Edoofa: That's fantastic, Ruvimbo! It's wonderful to hear about your diverse interests, including movies, music, and dancing. It seems like you have a well-rounded set of hobbies.
2/2/24, 2:06 PM - +263 71 658 2805: 😊
2/2/24, 2:15 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
2/2/24, 2:17 PM - +263 71 658 2805: Yes I do
2/2/24, 2:19 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Great, would you like to tell me?
2/2/24, 2:21 PM - +263 71 658 2805: Following instructions and being open minded
2/2/24, 2:25 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
2/2/24, 2:25 PM - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
2/2/24, 2:27 PM - +263 71 658 2805: Ooh okay
2/2/24, 2:28 PM - +263 71 658 2805: That's great
2/2/24, 2:34 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms. Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
2/2/24, 2:35 PM - +263 71 658 2805: It's a pleasure to know you all
2/2/24, 2:48 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Well, Anesu, it was nice connecting with you today. I wish we could talk a bit more; however, since our session time is over, let's connect on Monday as we don't have sessions over the weekend!

Happy weekend!🚀 <This message was edited>
2/2/24, 2:51 PM - +263 71 658 2805: Thank you .
Have a happy weekend too 😊
2/2/24, 2:55 PM - +27 78 792 0371: Thank your our great team on our son's road to success
5/2/24, 1:29 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Anesu!

Let us begin our session with an amazing fact! 

_*Did you know that a day on Venus is actually longer than a year on Venus? Even though it only takes Venus about 225 Earth days to go around the sun, it spins really slowly, taking about 243 Earth days to turn once on its axis. So, a day on Venus is longer than a whole year there! 🫨*_
5/2/24, 1:31 PM - +263 71 658 2805: 😱 this is incredible
5/2/24, 1:37 PM - +27 78 792 0371: Wao that's amazing, if my 51 years on earth were on Venus, good afternoon
5/2/24, 1:37 PM - +263 71 658 2805: Good afternoon how are you
5/2/24, 1:44 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Yes! I would like you to be informed of our program structure that will happen after we discuss all our projects in depth (not now), which will mandate us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
5/2/24, 1:46 PM - +263 71 658 2805: Intreasting indeed
5/2/24, 1:52 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
5/2/24, 1:52 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
5/2/24, 2:09 PM - +263 71 658 2805: I'm done😊
5/2/24, 2:13 PM - Ananya Edoofa: So may I know which section from the newsletter you *liked the most*, personally for me, it is very difficult to tell, each section has its taste and interest.
5/2/24, 2:15 PM - +263 71 658 2805: To be honest all the sections were very good...I liked them all
5/2/24, 2:16 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Indeed! now,  I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound?
5/2/24, 2:17 PM - +263 71 658 2805: It sounds great and I believe all these goals are going to be a success
5/2/24, 2:20 PM - Ananya Edoofa: We’re ready to begin your EWYL program now, and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects you can and will be a part of. Once you’ve gone through it thoroughly- we can discuss your understanding and then help you get started with the projects! Is that clear?
5/2/24, 2:20 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
5/2/24, 2:20 PM - +263 71 658 2805: Yes its clear
5/2/24, 2:30 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Now that our session time is over, I want you to read the document carefully and share your understanding with me before our tomorrow's session. Good day! 🚀 <This message was edited>
5/2/24, 2:31 PM - +263 71 658 2805: Thank you
6/2/24, 10:21 AM - +263 71 658 2805: Greetings to you all.
The document you sent me yesterday gave me a bigger picture on what the EWYL program is all obout.It is going to have a great impact in our future  because of the skills that it is bringing to us.The projects that it has are fascinating.The first  project made me hungry for work.I would really love to get in touch with big organizations.This is a very great opportunity in life because a student will be able to get professional connections which will be there forever.Im glad that the hard work comes with very very good rewards which are the scholarship credits which will assist in lowering the study costs.I was happy that the second project gives a student an opportunity to spread the news about the Edoofa program to friends and relatives so that many people's futures are brightened.What amazed me is that it's not only the friends and relatives who should know but even the schools in the student's region should know so that everyone gets the chance to hear about the Edoofa program.The EWYL program needs hard work and commitment which is a good experience in moulding a student's future.
6/2/24, 1:32 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Anesu!

How are you doing? Are you ready for your session?🚀
6/2/24, 1:34 PM - +263 71 658 2805: Good afternoon 
How are you
6/2/24, 1:34 PM - +263 71 658 2805: Yes Im  ready <This message was edited>
6/2/24, 1:43 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Well, I read your response, and I must appreciate your grasping power and obedience.
6/2/24, 1:45 PM - +263 71 658 2805: Thank you
6/2/24, 1:50 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Today, I will start by explaining the projects in detail. I am sharing an audio file with you. Here’s my suggestion- listen to it at least twice, you know- to make sure we don’t miss anything out, and then get back to me when you are finished with the process!
6/2/24, 1:50 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
6/2/24, 1:51 PM - +263 71 658 2805: Let me do that
6/2/24, 1:54 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Okay, so very quickly you summarize whatever you learned in the audio for me? Just so we’re on the same page about it.
6/2/24, 2:07 PM - +263 71 658 2805: From the audio I have learnt that I have the chance to make a small contribution to my country's growth which can be significant. This can be done through linking myself with big corporations using a platform called LinkedIn.I should create an account then get in touch with the corporations and ask them for an appointment with the Edoofa team
6/2/24, 2:08 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Great!  I’m happy with your understanding.
6/2/24, 2:08 PM - Ananya Edoofa: So, I am going to share an extremely significant document with you. Read it thoroughly as well as with careful details. I assure you- it’s as important as it sounds. After reading it, I want you to share what you understood from it. It helps me get a sense of how you’re learning with me!
6/2/24, 2:08 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
6/2/24, 2:28 PM - +263 71 658 2805: I got to know how to use the LinkedIn platform.I was wondering how this is possible but I was enlightened.I can't wait to do these tasks.I actually found that it is possible to get in touch with such big companies.It gives us the chance to to know what the companies really do in detail.I will also get the opportunity to talk with the employees.Im glad that I'm not in this alone but I'm with the Edoofa team
6/2/24, 2:29 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Great! Well, now that our session time is over, let us connect in our next session which is tomorrow at the same time. 🚀
6/2/24, 2:30 PM - +263 71 658 2805: 😊 see you tomorrow
