7/1/24, 8:47 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good evening!

I wanted to share some exciting news with all of you. As you may have noticed, my schedule has been quite packed lately due to work commitments. The reason behind this is something truly special – our team has organized a three-day long industrial visit called SLICE CON' 24 for our Indian Edoofians! 🚀

During this event, we are fortunate to have the Co-founders and CEOs of prominent brands who will be present and sharing their invaluable experiences in one-on-one sessions. Yes, you read that right – they will be there live, right in front of us! What's even more thrilling is that a few of our students are presenting a presentation directly to these CEOs, showcasing why Africa, your homeland, is the best market for their products. 🤝
7/1/24, 8:47 PM - Ananya Edoofa: While I am filled with excitement for this event, please note that due to my involvement in the visit on the 8th, 9th, and 10th of January, our regular sessions won't be taking place on these days. When we connect on the 11th of January, I'll share my students' experiences and pictures with you. 📸✨
9/1/24, 10:32 AM - +263 77 420 6520: Very well Ms Ananya
15/1/24, 9:42 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, @263774206520 

It has been observed that you have not been attending your sessions lately, nor following your EWYL ritual.

You know, we specifically allocate slots and time for you, and your non-attendance is truly disappointing and demotivating.

If you are facing any challenges, please let me know so that I can assist you. If you do not share it with me, how would I be able to help you?
15/1/24, 1:50 PM - +263 77 420 6520: Afternoon Ms Ananya.I am sorry for disappointing you.I was having challenges with my phone lately.It has since been rectified.The other challenge was that I changed my Tue and Thur to Monday and Friday sessions as you asked me to find convenient days but I noticed that they never changed so I resorted back to Tue and Thur by default.So I believe  I am scheduled for tomorrow

Genius, guess what? I'm super excited to share some awesome news – next month, we're planning a trip to Africa! 🌍 Yep, you heard it right! Our team is coming to your town. Just like last year, our students will be helping us organize the event, and we're looking for volunteers to join in and help manage everything! 🙌

Trust me, it will be an amazing experience with lots to learn! 🌈 Since planning this big event takes time and effort, our team will be so tight. 

In light of this, I'm proposing a slight adjustment to our session timetable. *Today, we won't be having our session as initially planned. However, worry not! I will soon share an updated timetable* and I am confident that together, we will create something truly extraordinary.
23/1/24, 5:40 PM - +263 77 420 6520: I really am looking forward to this

I have some exciting news to share with you. Tomorrow, we are going to celebrate Republic Day! Now, let me tell you a bit about it.

Republic Day is a special day in India. It's a time when we remember and celebrate the day our country adopted its Constitution. Just like a constitution helps guide a country, ours outlines the rules and principles that make India the diverse and vibrant place it is.

On Republic Day, we have a big parade in the capital city, where people from all over the country come together to showcase our culture, traditions, and achievements. It's like a colorful and lively show with music, dance, and different displays. The Indian flag is hoisted, and everyone sings the national anthem with pride.

People also fly kites, dress up in traditional clothes, and enjoy delicious food! 🇮🇳✨

This time it is bigger and better! Our Founder & CEO, Mr. Angad along with our team, admission officers, and counselors whom all of you have met behind the screens— are up to share priceless insights that will shape your next four years in India.
1/2/24, 2:50 PM - Ananya Edoofa: *We'd like to reserve your seats in advance. Could you please let us know how many people you'll be coming with? This will help us allocate the right number of slots for you.*

I recommend bringing your parents and guardians to the event. They play a crucial role in your education decisions. This event offers them a chance to understand the program and witness the journeys of past students, providing valuable insights for your higher education journey in India. So, get ready for this epic adventure, and I'll share the details with you super soon!
