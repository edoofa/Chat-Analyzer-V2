2/2/24, 10:19 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Good Morning, Darlington!

As your mentor, I understand that circumstances led you to delay your higher education journey as of last year, after taking a significant step towards building your future through us and I am sure that you must have been in touch with our Admissions team to figure out the best available solutions for you. Since then, Edoofa has been on a journey of innovation, creating new opportunities for learning and growth for students like you!

While I was going through your conversation, It reminded me of how I started my education journey full of questions and aspirations, and therefore I wanted to check in and have a conversation about how are you doing currently. 
May I know how are you planning to move your journey ahead?
2/2/24, 10:27 AM - +263 78 973 3211: Currently I have nothing to do, after all that happened to me, I have no job and I pretty much don't not know how I am going to support my higher education if I am to come this year. Last year truly left me at a difficult state but if there is a come back I'll gladly take the opportunity
2/2/24, 10:28 AM - +263 78 973 3211: I also wanted to know about if I am going to re apply the visa application when I come for the 2024 intake
2/2/24, 10:31 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Yes, Darlington, you have to reapply for the Visa!
2/2/24, 10:32 AM - +263 78 973 3211: Alright ma'am
2/2/24, 10:32 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Well,  life's journey is indeed filled with twists and turns, and your aspirations are still within reach. I have read your SOP and I would never want you to pull yourself back from your aspirations.
