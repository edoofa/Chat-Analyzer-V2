Your goals include staying organized, focused, and learning new skills. You're passionate about traveling, exploring cultures, and pursuing knowledge, along with a love for music.

2/2/24, 2:23 PM - +263 71 899 7085: For now l don't have any questions but l will notify if l have one
2/2/24, 2:30 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
2/2/24, 2:31 PM - +263 71 899 7085: No
2/2/24, 2:35 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Alright!  Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals. <This message was edited>
2/2/24, 2:35 PM - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
2/2/24, 2:37 PM - +263 71 899 7085: Well understood
3/2/24, 1:34 PM - +263 71 899 7085: Good day
3/2/24, 1:40 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Makanaka! 

We do not have our sessions over the weekend, let us connect on Monday at 1:30 Pm!

5/2/24, 1:32 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Makanaka!

Let us begin our session with an amazing fact! 

_*Did you know that a day on Venus is actually longer than a year on Venus? Even though it only takes Venus about 225 Earth days to go around the sun, it spins really slowly, taking about 243 Earth days to turn once on its axis. So, a day on Venus is longer than a whole year there! 🫨*_
5/2/24, 1:33 PM - +263 71 899 7085: Really,
5/2/24, 1:33 PM - +263 71 899 7085: Good afternoon
5/2/24, 1:41 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Yes! Now,  let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms. Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.

5/2/24, 1:49 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure that will happen after we discuss all our projects in depth (not now), which will mandate us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
5/2/24, 1:58 PM - +263 71 899 7085: Yes
5/2/24, 2:03 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.

6/2/24, 1:52 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Okay, so very quickly you summarize whatever you learned from the document for me? Just so we’re on the same page about it.
6/2/24, 2:33 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
6/2/24, 2:35 PM - +263 77 974 1606: I have gone  through  the document l  have managed to capture it's  thrust on ,
Awareness _ to keep updated on events that can affect positively or negatively 
Acquiring skills_enduring skills 
Emerging skills- shifting traditional ways of doing of business 
Relationship  building
.networking 
.business  development 
.decision making

I understand  they are three projects i. e corporate alliances , community  building and African schools education reform mission
This is  a reach out activity  of finding professionals and companies 

Community building it's basically about enhancement community among individuals  with a common need.
 African schools education reform mission- it gives a chance for African children to acquire knowledge on various fields of education
6/2/24, 3:01 PM - +263 77 974 1606: I have listened  to the audio and my understanding is premised  on; 
Corporate alliance is understanding  the market in your operating in. The need to identify companies thar technology driven and digital in nature.
The need to identify  family members who are in the private companies who in decision making positions. 
This is possible  by creating  a  LinkedIn account .
It gives an opportunity of type of companies to work  with .
