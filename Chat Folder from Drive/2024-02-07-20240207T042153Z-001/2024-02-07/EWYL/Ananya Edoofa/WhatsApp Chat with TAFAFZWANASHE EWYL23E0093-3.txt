I hope you all had the merriest Christmas celebration! 🎄 Due to the festive break, our session on Monday had to be called off. No worries, though – I hope you enjoyed the extra time for the festivities.

To make up for it, let's have a compensatory session *tomorrow at 9:30 am*.
I'm looking forward to catching up with all of you!

7/1/24, 8:50 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good evening!

I wanted to share some exciting news with all of you. As you may have noticed, my schedule has been quite packed lately due to work commitments. The reason behind this is something truly special – our team has organized a three-day long industrial visit called SLICE CON' 24 for our Indian Edoofians! 🚀

During this event, we are fortunate to have the Co-founders and CEOs of prominent brands who will be present and sharing their invaluable experiences in one-on-one sessions. Yes, you read that right – they will be there live, right in front of us! What's even more thrilling is that a few of our students are presenting a presentation directly to these CEOs, showcasing why Africa, your homeland, is the best market for their products. 🤝
7/1/24, 8:50 PM - Ananya Edoofa: While I am filled with excitement for this event, please note that due to my involvement in the visit on the 8th, 9th, and 10th of January, our regular sessions won't be taking place on these days. When we connect on the 11th of January, I'll share my students' experiences and pictures with you. 📸✨

11/1/24, 10:11 AM - Ananya Edoofa: A lovely morning to you, Tafafzwanashe!

Kindly excuse me for the short delay. I wanted to share a few glimpses of the industrial visit, SLICE CON 24, that was going on for the last three days, especially for our Indian Edoofinas! You know, it was so happening, and I am happy to share that we also welcomed Mr. Peter Hobwani, Deputy Head of Mission and Head of Chancery, Embassy of the Republic of Zimbabwe to India.

Not only this, but we also welcomed various industrial leaders, and it went super well; our students managed to give a presentation in front of them, and they really liked it. Our students also enjoyed the 'Tech made easy' sessions, where we taught them to use new-age technological tools, including Artificial Intelligence. The sweetest part was that a few of our students even prepared a surprise performance for us as well. It was indeed an amazing experience. When you are here in India, we will also connect at such events.
16/1/24, 9:07 AM - +263 71 800 1668: Good morning mentor. May l please have an application form.
18/1/24, 2:51 PM - +263 71 800 1668: Greetings mentor. I will not be able to continue with edoofa because l didnt come out with the expected points in a level. 
Thank you for the lessons and everything.
27/1/24, 8:06 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning,  @263718001668 

 How are you doing today? I apologize for the slight delay from my end. Our entire team is currently engaged in planning the Africa trip, and we're thrilled to announce that our team will be visiting your homeland to meet with you! Given the time and effort required for organizing such a significant event, it took me some time to connect with you.
27/1/24, 8:10 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Tafadzwanashe, I understand how it feels when you do not get the expected results. However, as your mentor, I want you to understand that sometimes, we do not see immediate results for our hard work. Nevertheless, it's crucial to believe that this is not the end. You should stand up and work again for your best.

I know that being optimistic at this time is not easy, but trust me, we are in this together. I don't want you to think that way. Why am I here if I cannot assure you that this is not the end? Tell me, do you want to talk to me about this?
27/1/24, 9:12 AM - +263 71 800 1668: Greetings. I had two sittings for A level and attained 2 subjects with grade B and an E. The other third subject it seems l have no strength in it. I'm interested in information technology which l got a B, but it requires a high grade in mathematics which l got an E. After researching l realised will have a low chance of getting into university with such grades, especially abroad, so my thoughts were to do a diploma and get the required results to do computer science. I'm sure if l wasn't working hard it would be proven then and if l am not intelligent to do that course l will see it by then.
I cannot sit again for a level so l thought it would be best to try something and go to university later.
27/1/24, 10:40 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Tafadzwanashe, don't worry! You've got us. First of all, let me tell you that you have done a great job with the two subjects, so congratulations! 🤝🏽 <This message was edited>

I know they will help you with your confusion and situation in a better way, given their extensive experience. They will recommend the best solution so that you never have to give up on your dreams. <This message was edited>
27/1/24, 10:55 AM - +263 71 800 1668: May you please help me. I failed to recover my admission group. As you know l always reached out to you whenever l got logged out of my WhatsApp to add me in the group, l was logged out of the group and could not reach out to my admission mentors.
27/1/24, 11:02 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, give me a minute!
