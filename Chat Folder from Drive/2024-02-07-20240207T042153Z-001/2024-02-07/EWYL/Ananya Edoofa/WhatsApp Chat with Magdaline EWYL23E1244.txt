6/2/24, 9:22 AM - +260 760061219: My grandfather is in a meeting at the moment.
6/2/24, 9:24 AM - Ananya Edoofa: That's alright, you can share the invite and he can join later.  Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
6/2/24, 9:27 AM - +260 760061219: No please.
6/2/24, 9:27 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals. <This message was edited>
6/2/24, 9:27 AM - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
6/2/24, 9:28 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, now that our session time is over, let us reconnect tomorrow at the same time.

Have a good day ahead!🚀
6/2/24, 9:29 AM - +260 760061219: Thank you very much, you too.
