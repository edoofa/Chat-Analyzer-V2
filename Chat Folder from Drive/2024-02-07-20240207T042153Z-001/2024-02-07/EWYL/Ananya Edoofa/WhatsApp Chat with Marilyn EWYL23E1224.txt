5/2/24, 1:29 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, marilyn!

Let us begin our session with an amazing fact! 

_*Did you know that a day on Venus is actually longer than a year on Venus? Even though it only takes Venus about 225 Earth days to go around the sun, it spins really slowly, taking about 243 Earth days to turn once on its axis. So, a day on Venus is longer than a whole year there! 🫨*_
5/2/24, 1:39 PM - +263 77 232 4967: Good afternoon. Thank you for letting me know about a day in Venus
5/2/24, 1:45 PM - Ananya Edoofa: So, to kick things off with a bang, I wanted to share a fantastic video with you that I think will help us connect on a deeper level. Get ready to be inspired!
5/2/24, 1:45 PM - Ananya Edoofa: This message was deleted
5/2/24, 1:46 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
5/2/24, 1:49 PM - +263 77 232 4967: Okay
5/2/24, 1:56 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Now, before we move forward I would like to know more about you!
Would you like to share a quick introduction?
5/2/24, 2:03 PM - +263 77 232 4967: My name is Mthokozisi Bhuti Ndlovu, Marilyn Sandiso Ndlovu' parent, I'm a 39year old male, family man with 4 children, self-employed and very hardworking. I want the best for my daughter and for her to get better opportunities in life. I enjoy sports, mostly football and l also enjoying reading.
5/2/24, 2:08 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Nice to meet you, Mthokozisi Bhuti Ndlovu! 😊 Family man with four kids, that's wonderful! Your dedication to wanting the best for your daughter is truly admirable. Being self-employed and hardworking speaks volumes. What's your favorite aspect of sports, especially football? And any favorite books or genres you enjoy reading?

Looking forward to more conversations and getting to know you better! 🌟⚽📚
5/2/24, 2:13 PM - +263 77 232 4967: I'm a 100% loyal supporter of a local team this side called Highlanders Football Club which was established in 1926 with full membership. I aslo support Manchester United in the UK and Real Madrid in Spain. I enjoy reading short stories in my mother language which is Ndebele language.
5/2/24, 2:15 PM - Ananya Edoofa: That's great! Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
5/2/24, 2:18 PM - +263 77 232 4967: You can elaborate but I hope I'm correct when i say scholarship credits and financial burden reduction
5/2/24, 2:20 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
5/2/24, 2:20 PM - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
5/2/24, 2:22 PM - +263 77 232 4967: Well understood. Thank you
5/2/24, 2:31 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Now that our session time is over, let us connect tomorrow at the same time.

Remember, your consistency is the most vital asset for your life. Maintain that if you want to achieve success!
5/2/24, 2:31 PM - +263 77 232 4967: Okay. Noted
6/2/24, 1:34 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Marilyn

How are you doing? Are you ready for your session?🚀
6/2/24, 1:40 PM - +263 77 232 4967: Good afternoon to you too. I'm very well thanks and how are you?

I'm ready for the session...
6/2/24, 1:46 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms. Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
6/2/24, 1:48 PM - +263 77 232 4967: That's great. I'm honored to be joined by them in my sessions
6/2/24, 1:52 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure that will happen after we discuss all our projects in depth (not now), which will mandate us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
6/2/24, 1:56 PM - +263 77 232 4967: Yes, right.
6/2/24, 2:00 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
6/2/24, 2:00 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
6/2/24, 2:01 PM - +263 77 232 4967: Okay
6/2/24, 2:02 PM - Ananya Edoofa: So may I know which section from the newsletter you *liked the most*, personally for me, it is very difficult to tell, each section has its taste and interest.
6/2/24, 2:09 PM - +263 77 232 4967: I liked the, " 2 questions for me." Very informative, interesting and powerful.
6/2/24, 2:14 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Did you notice the _Edoofa Hall of Inspiration_? I am sure you would one day want yourself to be celebrated in this section, the entire Student community reads this newsletter and it's a great deal to be mentioned by the founder himself, isn't it?
6/2/24, 2:18 PM - +263 77 232 4967: Yes it's more than a dream coming true
6/2/24, 2:27 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Now,  We’re ready to begin your EWYL program now, and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects you can and will be a part of. Once you’ve gone through it thoroughly- we can discuss your understanding and then help you get started with the projects! Is that clear?
6/2/24, 2:27 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
6/2/24, 2:28 PM - +263 77 232 4967: Okay
6/2/24, 2:30 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Well, now that our session time is over, let us connect in our next session which is tomorrow at the same time. 🚀
6/2/24, 2:40 PM - +263 77 232 4967: Okay thank you
