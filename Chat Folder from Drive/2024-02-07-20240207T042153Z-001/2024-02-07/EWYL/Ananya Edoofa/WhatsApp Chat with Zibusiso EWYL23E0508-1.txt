6/2/24, 8:50 AM - +263 71 603 6028: The document above explains the projects I have to do for the EWYL program.

The first project is cooperate alliances where I will have to help  edoofa  to spread and build partner companies here in Zimbabwe .This  will  help  edoofa to create  a strong   network  and help as many children as they can.

Second project is community building where my task is to reach  out  to  the people in my local community and spread the good word about the edoofa scholarship program. I feel edoofa can really help lots of children here in Zimbabwe to acquire their higher level education in one of the best universities in the world

African schools education reform mission is the third project. My primary task is to reach  out  to  local  schools  in my local area to speak to the administrators and let them know about the edoofa scholarship program
