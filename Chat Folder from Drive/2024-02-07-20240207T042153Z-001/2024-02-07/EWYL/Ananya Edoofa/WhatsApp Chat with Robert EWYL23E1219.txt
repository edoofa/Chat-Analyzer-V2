I hope you are doing well. Are you ready to begin today's session?
2/2/24, 1:29 PM - +27 69 308 9669: Yes I'm ready
2/2/24, 1:33 PM - +27 82 472 0625 joined using this group's invite link
2/2/24, 1:44 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
2/2/24, 1:45 PM - +27 69 308 9669: Yes I need to understand .
2/2/24, 1:55 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
2/2/24, 1:55 PM - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
2/2/24, 1:57 PM - +27 69 308 9669: Ok thank you I understand
2/2/24, 2:00 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms. Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
2/2/24, 2:02 PM - +27 69 308 9669: Ok you can introduce them
2/2/24, 2:06 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure that will happen after we discuss all our projects in depth (not now), which will mandate us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
2/2/24, 2:08 PM - +27 69 308 9669: Yes it sounds good
2/2/24, 2:17 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
2/2/24, 2:18 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
2/2/24, 2:21 PM - +27 69 308 9669: Ok let me go through .. I can't wait
2/2/24, 2:25 PM - Ananya Edoofa: So may I know which section from the newsletter you *liked the most*, personally for me, it is very difficult to tell, each section has its taste and interest.
2/2/24, 2:29 PM - +27 69 308 9669: Every thing is interesting. But the quotes are leading so far
2/2/24, 2:30 PM - +27 69 308 9669: The news letter give me energy to read it again. I can't wait for other . It a short in size but the content is to big
2/2/24, 2:34 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Great! At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound?
2/2/24, 2:39 PM - +27 69 308 9669: It sounds good
2/2/24, 2:52 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
5/2/24, 1:29 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Robert!

Let us begin our session with an amazing fact! 

_*Did you know that a day on Venus is actually longer than a year on Venus? Even though it only takes Venus about 225 Earth days to go around the sun, it spins really slowly, taking about 243 Earth days to turn once on its axis. So, a day on Venus is longer than a whole year there! 🫨*_
5/2/24, 1:32 PM - +27 69 308 9669: A day is longer than year in same plannet
5/2/24, 1:32 PM - +27 69 308 9669: I didn't know that
5/2/24, 1:39 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Now you know! So did you get a chance to read the document? If yes,I want you to share your understanding of the document with me. I just want to ensure we don’t miss anything! So, please, go on sharing your understanding of the above document.
5/2/24, 1:48 PM - +27 69 308 9669: I did go through the document.  I understand what exactly is the EWYLP, how are we doing to get scholarship credits,where exactly the money comes from. The document also explains with some examples how to talk to employees. After I read the document now I have a LinkedIn profile
5/2/24, 1:53 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I will start by explaining the projects in detail. I am sharing an audio file with you. Here’s my suggestion- listen to it at least twice, you know- to make sure we don’t miss anything out, and then get back to me when you are finished with the process!
5/2/24, 1:53 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
5/2/24, 2:02 PM - +27 69 308 9669: I listen it .
5/2/24, 2:07 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Okay, so very quickly you summarize whatever you learned in the audio for me? Just so we’re on the same page about it.
5/2/24, 2:23 PM - +27 69 308 9669: I Understand the fact that the world have been changed after the global pandemic so now we can connect to different companies which are doing online technologies. The first task is to download LinkedIn then creat an account,after account search the companies or organisations which offer online jobs . After we get the companies the we have to connect with decision makers of such organisation ,talk to the managers , human resources managers . Then after the discussion we can ask for their email address and phone number and the correct schedule to connect with them so that  I can link them to my mentors of Edoofa
5/2/24, 2:32 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
5/2/24, 2:35 PM - +27 69 308 9669: Thank you
6/2/24, 12:12 PM - +27 69 308 9669: Morning
6/2/24, 12:23 PM - +27 69 308 9669: From the previous document I understand that how to search companies. The are some factors we should consider when we are looking for the companies. The first factor is the nature of the company, we should choose the companies which are suitable for student-centric for example virtual gaming platform, podcasts/music apps , social interaction platforms. We should also consider the scale of the company. These is to look how big the company is . We are required to choose medium companies not too big or small. Financial stability is another factor we should look during the companies selection. We also have to search about the background of the company. The platform which can be used are google, LinkedIn, crunch Base,ich4media or social media platform like Facebook Instagram and twitter.

6/2/24, 2:37 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Let me introduce you to the scholarship program that is providing me an opportunity to fulfill all my dreams related to higher education - EDOOFA -Education For All.
6/2/24, 2:37 PM - Ananya Edoofa: To give you an insight about Edoofa, it is a scholarship program initiated by *Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd., INDIA*. Edoofa believes quality education should be accessible to all and not just the privilege of a few. Through our scholarship program that is based on a work-study model, Edoofa solves both problems, that of *lack of affordability and of employability in higher education.* Edoofa stays with the students throughout their academic life as mentor and caretaker, right from building the application, applying to colleges, training, and making them job-ready. This is an experience that I acknowledge as being a Proud Edoofian!🎉
6/2/24, 2:37 PM - Ananya Edoofa: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, Edoofa has worked with 250+ Universities in India and has a community of *more than 3000 students* from different countries📍
6/2/24, 2:37 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Edoofa receives applications from _South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries_. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 2100 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just *affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven* so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains
6/2/24, 2:37 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I would like each one of you to take a look at the video that I am sharing below. The video is regarding Edoofa’s Meet and Greet session where Edoofa’s founders Mr. Angad Singh and Mr. Avreen Singh interacted with various School Principals, African students, and their parents in Harare, Zimbabwe last year.
Please have a look at it and share your thoughts with me.
