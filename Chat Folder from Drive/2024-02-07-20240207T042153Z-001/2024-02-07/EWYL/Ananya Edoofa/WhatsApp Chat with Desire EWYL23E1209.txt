Let us begin our session with an amazing fact! 

_*Did you know that a day on Venus is actually longer than a year on Venus? Even though it only takes Venus about 225 Earth days to go around the sun, it spins really slowly, taking about 243 Earth days to turn once on its axis. So, a day on Venus is longer than a whole year there!*_ 🫨 <This message was edited>
5/2/24, 8:32 AM - +263 78 126 3228: Wow amazing

5/2/24, 8:35 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Thank you so much for asking, I am doing good!
5/2/24, 8:35 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Now, before we move forward I would like to know more about you!
Would you like to share a quick introduction?
5/2/24, 8:38 AM - +263 78 126 3228: That’s fine
5/2/24, 8:41 AM - +263 78 126 3228: Hello,  well My name is Desire Rudairo C Chiminya , and I am thrilled to connect with you all. I am  turning 18 years old . I’m dedicated to be a computer engineer.

In my free time, you’ll find me feeling  music . Let’s embark on this journey together, share ideas, and create meaningful connections. Feel free to reach out love engaging in conversations about this career path.
5/2/24, 8:41 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Nice to meet you, Desire Rudairo C Chiminya! 🎉 Turning 18, that's awesome! Happy early birthday! 🎂 Being dedicated to becoming a computer engineer is fantastic. It's a cool field! 🖥️

I see you're into music too—nice! 🎶 What kind of music are you into? Any favorite artists or genres?
5/2/24, 8:48 AM - +263 78 126 3228: Thank you so much , yea that’s my dream

Well i listen to all genres ,
5/2/24, 8:49 AM - +263 78 126 3228: I also listen to Zakir Hussain
5/2/24, 8:50 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Really? Wow! I also like him, which song is your favorite?
5/2/24, 8:57 AM - +263 78 126 3228: Yes , Sitar
5/2/24, 8:58 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Wow! Amazing! Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
5/2/24, 8:59 AM - +263 78 126 3228: No you can share with me
5/2/24, 9:00 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
5/2/24, 9:00 AM - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
5/2/24, 9:01 AM - +263 78 126 3228: Noted
5/2/24, 9:01 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms. Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
5/2/24, 9:03 AM - +263 78 126 3228: Noted
5/2/24, 9:04 AM - Ananya Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure that will happen after we discuss all our projects in depth (not now), which will mandate us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
5/2/24, 9:05 AM - +263 78 126 3228: Yes
5/2/24, 9:06 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.

5/2/24, 9:18 AM - Ananya Edoofa: So may I know which section from the newsletter you *liked the most*, personally for me, it is very difficult to tell, each section has its taste and interest.
5/2/24, 9:30 AM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
5/2/24, 9:33 AM - +263 78 126 3228: The whole document, every section was interesting

6/2/24, 8:36 AM - Ananya Edoofa: I can see that you have read the document, I want you to share your understanding of the document with me. I just want to ensure we don’t miss anything! So, please, go on sharing your understanding of the above document.
6/2/24, 8:48 AM - +263 78 126 3228: <Media omitted>
6/2/24, 8:52 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Great! I will start by explaining the projects in detail. I am sharing an audio file with you. Here’s my suggestion- listen to it at least twice, you know- to make sure we don’t miss anything out, and then get back to me when you are finished with the process!
6/2/24, 8:52 AM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
6/2/24, 9:06 AM - +263 78 126 3228: Right am done ✅
6/2/24, 9:09 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Okay, so very quickly you summarize whatever you learned in the audio for me? Just so we’re on the same page about it.
6/2/24, 9:28 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, now that our session time is over, let us reconnect tomorrow at the same time.

Have a good day ahead!🚀
