I hope you had a fantastic New Year! Because of the holiday break, our Monday session had to be canceled, but don't worry about it. I hope you enjoyed the extra time for celebrations.🌟

To make up for it, let's have a special session *tomorrow at 9:30 AM*. Get ready to tell me how you celebrated the New Year, and I'll also share my resolution with you. I'm looking forward to catching up with you!🕤
2/1/24, 7:11 PM - +263 78 438 4724: Ok Ms Ananya I had a fantastic new year
7/1/24, 8:51 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good evening!

I wanted to share some exciting news with all of you. As you may have noticed, my schedule has been quite packed lately due to work commitments. The reason behind this is something truly special – our team has organized a three-day long industrial visit called SLICE CON' 24 for our Indian Edoofians! 🚀

During this event, we are fortunate to have the Co-founders and CEOs of prominent brands who will be present and sharing their invaluable experiences in one-on-one sessions. Yes, you read that right – they will be there live, right in front of us! What's even more thrilling is that a few of our students are presenting a presentation directly to these CEOs, showcasing why Africa, your homeland, is the best market for their products. 🤝
7/1/24, 8:51 PM - Ananya Edoofa: While I am filled with excitement for this event, please note that due to my involvement in the visit on the 8th, 9th, and 10th of January, our regular sessions won't be taking place on these days. When we connect on the 11th of January, I'll share my students' experiences and pictures with you. 📸✨

Faith, guess what? I'm super excited to share some awesome news – next month, we're planning a trip to Africa! 🌍 Yep, you heard it right! Our team is coming to your town. Just like last year, our students will be helping us organize the event, and we're looking for volunteers to join in and help manage everything! 🙌

Trust me, it will be an amazing experience with lots to learn! 🌈 Since planning this big event takes time and effort, our team will be so tight. 

Because of this, I'm proposing a slight adjustment to our session timetable. *As of now, we won't be having our session as initially planned. However, worry not! I will soon share an updated timetable*. Meanwhile, you can keep working on your targets and keep me posted on your EWYL group.
1/2/24, 3:12 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Faith!

Remember the event I teased you about in Africa? Well, it's happening next month, and it's going to be massive – the biggest in Zimbabwe's history, with an expected crowd of *5000 people*! Surprising, isn't it? Get ready for an unforgettable experience! 🌍🎉

This time it is bigger and better! Our Founder & CEO, Mr. Angad along with our team, admission officers, and counselors whom all of you have met behind the screens— are up to share priceless insights that will shape your next four years in India.
1/2/24, 3:12 PM - Ananya Edoofa: *We'd like to reserve your seats in advance. Could you please let us know how many people you'll be coming with? This will help us allocate the right number of slots for you.*

I recommend bringing your parents and guardians to the event. They play a crucial role in your education decisions. This event offers them a chance to understand the program and witness the journeys of past students, providing valuable insights for your higher education journey in India. So, get ready for this epic adventure, and I'll share the details with you super soon!
