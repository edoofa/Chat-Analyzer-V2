Let us begin our session with an amazing fact! 

_*Did you know that a day on Venus is actually longer than a year on Venus? Even though it only takes Venus about 225 Earth days to go around the sun, it spins really slowly, taking about 243 Earth days to turn once on its axis. So, a day on Venus is longer than a whole year there! 🫨*_ <This message was edited>

6/2/24, 1:53 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Now, before we move forward I would like to know more about you!
Would you like to share a quick introduction?
6/2/24, 2:01 PM - +263 71 238 8180: My name is Tashinga Prunella Musonza, an eighteen-year-old from Harare, Zimbabwe. I am a self-critic and an ambivert who loves reading. I am also a youth advocate, serving as a Junior Parliamentarian in my country and a member of the Ladies of Liberty Alliance Zimbabwe, where I advocate for women's rights.

One of my key skills is being a good communicator. For example, I have organized and led discussions on important issues affecting young people in my community, effectively conveying information and facilitating dialogue.

I am also good at handling many tasks simultaneously. For instance, I have successfully balanced my responsibilities as a student, advocate, and Junior Parliamentarian, managing my time and priorities effectively.

Furthermore, I consider myself teachable and open-minded. When I first joined the Ladies of Liberty Alliance Zimbabwe, I was eager to learn from more experienced advocates and was open to new ideas and perspectives that could improve my advocacy work.

In addition, I prioritize efficiency in all my endeavors. For instance, when organizing events for the youth in my community, I ensure that resources are used effectively and that the events run smoothly.

Moreover, I am self-disciplined. As a Junior Parliamentarian, I have consistently met deadlines for submitting proposals and participating in parliamentary sessions, demonstrating my ability to stay focused and organized even under pressure. <This message was edited>
6/2/24, 2:03 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Wow, you're doing some amazing stuff at just 18! Your passion for advocacy and your ability to handle multiple responsibilities is truly inspiring. It's awesome to see your dedication to making a difference in your community, especially in advocating for youth and women's rights. Keep up the fantastic work! 🌟 If you ever need support or want to bounce ideas around, count me in!
6/2/24, 2:05 PM - +263 71 238 8180: Thank you so much for your kind words Ma'am.
6/2/24, 2:05 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
6/2/24, 2:14 PM - +263 71 238 8180: Yes l understand the two objectives Ma'am
6/2/24, 2:15 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
6/2/24, 2:15 PM - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
6/2/24, 2:16 PM - +263 71 238 8180: Thank you Ma'am, l have taken note of the messages above.
6/2/24, 2:26 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
6/2/24, 2:30 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Well, now that our session time is over, let us connect in our next session which is tomorrow at the same time. 🚀
6/2/24, 2:40 PM - +263 71 238 8180: It is a pleasure to meet you all.
6/2/24, 2:40 PM - +263 71 238 8180: Noted Ma'am thank you. Have a great day.
