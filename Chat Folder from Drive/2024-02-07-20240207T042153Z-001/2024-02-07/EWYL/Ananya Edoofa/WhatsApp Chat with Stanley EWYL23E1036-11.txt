26/12/23, 1:32 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Stanley!

I really hope that your Christmas went well. Let's discuss how we celebrated our Christmas this year in our session! Come on, join your EWYL Line, and let's talk about our celebration!
26/12/23, 1:34 PM - +263 71 987 5652: Yes I would like to share I did it,  mine was not good enough because  my parents left for an adult  family  meeting  so we left with my brother so we haven't seen each other yet with my parents  but I'm glad to have pass through  though
26/12/23, 1:34 PM - +263 71 987 5652: About you how did it go at that side
26/12/23, 1:47 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I understand, Stanley! We decorated a small Christmas tree in our office and it was an amazing experience!
26/12/23, 1:47 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
26/12/23, 1:49 PM - +263 71 987 5652: Wow this is beautiful, very beautiful l estimate that it was a good Christmas for guys
26/12/23, 1:51 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Indeed! Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
26/12/23, 1:52 PM - +263 71 987 5652: Yes please
26/12/23, 1:52 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Well,  the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
26/12/23, 1:52 PM - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
26/12/23, 1:54 PM - +263 71 987 5652: Ok I get it
26/12/23, 1:57 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms. Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
26/12/23, 2:00 PM - +263 71 987 5652: Okay I get it
26/12/23, 2:02 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure that will happen after we discuss all our projects in depth (not now), which will mandate us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
26/12/23, 2:04 PM - +263 71 987 5652: Yes please very interested
26/12/23, 2:05 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.

1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!

29/12/23, 9:46 PM - +263 77 303 1160 joined using this group's invite link
2/1/24, 1:33 PM - +263 71 987 5652: Hallo mentor I'm ready for the session
2/1/24, 1:34 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Stanley!

Before we dive into today's session, I'm curious – how was your New Year? Did you have a chance to celebrate and welcome the new chapter?
2/1/24, 1:35 PM - +263 71 987 5652: My new year was quite exciting and you really had very fun with my family together I don't know about you here in Zimbabwe it was great
2/1/24, 1:38 PM - +263 71 987 5652: It was so great how did you tackle it on that side
2/1/24, 1:43 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Well, it was good for me as well! 🌟
2/1/24, 1:43 PM - +263 71 987 5652: Better
2/1/24, 1:47 PM - Ananya Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
2/1/24, 1:48 PM - Ananya Edoofa: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*

*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED*
2/1/24, 1:48 PM - Ananya Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
2/1/24, 1:48 PM - Ananya Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)
2/1/24, 1:48 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Once they add you there, you can share the link to YOUR WhatsApp Group (that you created in the first step) and tell them that on that group you will be sharing information about an exciting opportunity where they get a chance to pursue your education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on the tuition fee. To know more, please get added to the group.
2/1/24, 1:48 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
2/1/24, 1:48 PM - Ananya Edoofa: 2] ADD MENTOR:

2/1/24, 1:48 PM - +263 71 987 5652: Okay im waiting for it
2/1/24, 1:49 PM - +263 71 987 5652: Yes I have seen it when i was applying
2/1/24, 1:52 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, in order to move ahead with your second project, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
2/1/24, 1:52 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I am ____________, a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in *Zimbabwe*, where tuition fees range from ZWL 650,000 to ZWL 750,000 per term. When considering the yearly cost, including food and accommodation, it exceeds $2,100 in our beloved Zimbabwe⏫

Today, the internet is a necessity, and I truly realized its importance when preparing for my journey to India. We are all well aware of the expenses we have to bear just to access subpar internet services. During my school days, I used to spend a minimum of $35-$40 a month to ensure I had sufficient internet, which added up to around $450-$500 annually.
*It's remarkable to discover that in India, students value their educational infrastructure so much that they can access a necessity like the internet for around $40 for the entire year.*💥
Conversely, when speaking to my seniors in Zimbabwe, I realized that I might have to compromise on my choice of course due to limited available seats. Furthermore, many seniors are struggling with unemployment after graduating in Zimbabwe
I had a strong desire to support my family through part-time employment during my course, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn between $50 and $100 per month throughout the course.
*While pursuing tertiary education in India is more affordable than universities in Zimbabwe, it comes with its own challenges. I diligently followed the 5S, which played a crucial role in helping me qualify for this scholarship. I urge you to go through these Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors will ask you questions based on the information in the flyer I have attached*
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5s of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

2/1/24, 1:52 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Let me introduce you to the scholarship program that is providing me an opportunity to fulfill all my dreams related to higher education - EDOOFA -Education For All.
2/1/24, 1:52 PM - Ananya Edoofa: To give you an insight about Edoofa, it is a scholarship program initiated by *Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd., INDIA*. Edoofa believes quality education should be accessible to all and not just the privilege of a few. Through our scholarship program that is based on a work-study model, Edoofa solves both problems, that of *lack of affordability and of employability in higher education.* Edoofa stays with the students throughout their academic life as mentor and caretaker, right from building the application, applying to colleges, training, and making them job-ready. This is an experience that I acknowledge as being a Proud Edoofian!🎉
2/1/24, 1:52 PM - Ananya Edoofa: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, Edoofa has worked with 250+ Universities in India and has a community of *more than 3000 students* from different countries📍

For more than 50,000 applications there are just 2100 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just *affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven* so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains
2/1/24, 1:52 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I would like each one of you to take a look at the video that I am sharing below. The video is regarding Edoofa’s Meet and Greet session where Edoofa’s founders Mr. Angad Singh and Mr. Avreen Singh interacted with various School Principals, African students, and their parents in Harare, Zimbabwe last year.
Please have a look at it and share your thoughts with me.

2/1/24, 2:20 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Now that’s bang-on! I couldn’t have asked anyone to explain it better than you have- so, congratulations. However, I’d still like to ask- are there any questions you have about this project?
2/1/24, 2:23 PM - +263 71 987 5652: Okay mantle answer this program obviously I will face the rejections that most people ask me if you are enrolling us to India yet you're not here we yet you're not there in India some people may find it very hard to to believe it so I will need some tips so that I can motivate them as I am motivated
2/1/24, 2:25 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, I will help you with that. So, for the people who do not trust us, you can opt for the following things:

Yes, I have seen it and Excellent job on submitting the form! I've promptly shared it with our highly dedicated counseling team. It's essential that you keep up consistent communication with the student and promptly attend to any questions or concerns they might have. Your proactive engagement will ensure a smooth process.
6/1/24, 1:31 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Stanley!

I wanted to share some exciting news with all of you. As you may have noticed, my schedule has been quite packed lately due to work commitments. The reason behind this is something truly special – our team has organized a three-day long industrial visit called *SLICE CON' 24* for our Indian Edoofians! 🚀

During this event, *we are fortunate to have the Co-founders and CEOs of prominent brands* who will be present and sharing their invaluable *experiences in one-on-one sessions.* Yes, you read that right – they will be there live, right in front of us! What's even more thrilling is that a few of our students are presenting a presentation directly to these CEOs, showcasing why Africa, your homeland, is the best market for their products. 🤝
6/1/24, 1:31 PM - Ananya Edoofa: While I am filled with excitement for this event, please note that due to my involvement in the visit on the *8th, 9th, and 10th of January*, our regular sessions won't be taking place on these days. When we connect on the 11th of January, I'll share my students' experiences and pictures with you. 📸✨
6/1/24, 1:44 PM - +263 71 987 5652: Okay Mentor  please have an exiting activity  during these days🤗

9/1/24, 12:48 PM - +263 71 987 5652: Good morning my mentor, today I created this channel so is to make my project number two very effective. In this way I've created this channel so that I can lure more followers and also expose the beneficiaries of my scholarship program to many of my friends as well. This is why I've sent you this channel so that maybe you would like to follow up my purposes as you said you will be giving me proper guidance during this project. Also Ms Ananya I figured out that most people in Zimbabwe likes eye catching things. And with this I am pleading if you can support me with some much motivational videos of some of our proud Edoofians , their activities you know like when they're under Laboratory and also some motivational pictures of some students who succeeded to our scholarship program. With this mental I'm hoping that I will go further as I try to put more efforts on my work as well. I hope you can see my progress in my group which I've added you. Hope you are doing well and I'm very excited for you to show me some pictures of the event you were involved during this program in between the 8th 9th and 10th of January. Hope you're doing well. Yes Zimbabwe seems to be very hot.

11/1/24, 2:25 PM - +263 71 987 5652: Okay so what's our next step. Mentor I'm putting all my strength to dance according to your tune and l want to perfect everything you task me and earn more credits to make my financial  payments flexible
11/1/24, 2:29 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Indeed, Stanley,  since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how you can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-
1. Give your best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss your EWYL sessions without informing your mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share your challenges and the things you’re good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make your mentor trust you fully
11/1/24, 2:30 PM - +263 71 987 5652: Okay am  l showing any of these to you either
11/1/24, 2:31 PM - +263 71 987 5652: That's so great and I'm trying  my best to stick to this mentor
11/1/24, 2:38 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Great! So now we are ready to begin our new journey.
FIRST- Please note your batch timings for your sessions.
Tuesday and Friday : 9:30 a.m to 11:00 a.m
SECOND- In our sessions, we will discuss the weekend activity or the Wednesday lesson plus the projects and the newsletter.
THIRD- All our conversations from now on will take forward in the EWYL Line.
11/1/24, 2:38 PM - Ananya Edoofa: The EWYL line contact number is: +91 98107 89170
Please ensure that you connect with me on the EWYL Line every day by saying  'I am a Proud Edoofian'.

It is essential to say this daily as it connects all students, counselors, mentors, and parents associated with Edoofa. Without this, we will not be able to conduct our sessions and may fall behind in terms of earning credits.

"I am a Proud Edoofian" will be considered as your attendance, and we will commence the session only when we receive this message from you.
11/1/24, 2:38 PM - Ananya Edoofa: This message was deleted
11/1/24, 2:38 PM - Ananya Edoofa: FOURTH: I want you to drop a message on this EWYL line:

 'Greetings, Ms. Ananya, I am <NAME> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....'
11/1/24, 2:40 PM - +263 71 987 5652: Okay I'm on it so should I start it now to at least show that I'm in or an indication
11/1/24, 2:50 PM - +263 71 987 5652: So Mentor,  if l am asked  a question to expose my insights  should i expose it on that number   or in this group
11/1/24, 2:55 PM - Ananya Edoofa: You can do it on either of them!
11/1/24, 2:59 PM - +263 71 987 5652: Okay Maam so im on it
11/1/24, 3:16 PM - +263 71 987 5652: Okay, as exposed by this link above, International exposure can benefit my career since it gives me a proper insight on how to handle things.  As l  was going through the pages I saw some proud Edoofians having some carrier guidances, good lecturing skills and also I can see their successes through this page. As such I can comment that this program is a wonderful program to those who are motivated in learning. It also gives opportunities for one to even fly high and also come with flying colors moreover it covers most people's motives to study abroad. Therefore I can see to my own point of view this scholarship program is the Paramount to every Edoofian to reach highest levels of Education and the scholarship and also to have a high employment step in life
11/1/24, 3:32 PM - +263 71 987 5652: Mentor can you help me please... What do l do if the EWYL  number keeps asking one  question
12/1/24, 9:35 AM - +263 71 987 5652: Morning  mentor
12/1/24, 9:38 AM - +263 71 987 5652: Mantor I'm available for decision as we discussed yesterday. But I'm having a problem in fact I need your help on this, I'm sending the feedback in that EWYL number but it's only asking me that very question again and again so what do I do so that I can proceed. Please help me.
12/1/24, 9:51 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Stanley!

Since your session is scheduled for Tuesdays and Fridays, therefore we could not connect yesterday! It's your session time, kindly join the EWYL Line.
12/1/24, 9:52 AM - +263 71 987 5652: Yes maam I'm already  there

Stanley, guess what? I'm super excited to share some awesome news – next month, we're planning a trip to Africa! 🌍 Yep, you heard it right! Our team is coming to your town. Just like last year, our students will be helping us organize the event, and we're looking for volunteers to join in and help manage everything! 🙌

Trust me, it will be an amazing experience with lots to learn! 🌈 Since planning this big event takes time and effort, our team will be so tight. 

In light of this, I'm proposing a slight adjustment to our session timetable. *Today, we won't be having our session as initially planned. However, worry not! I will soon share an updated timetable* and I am confident that together, we will create something truly extraordinary.

I understand that we haven't been connecting through our sessions lately; however, as your mentor, my priority is your progress, and I don't want you to compromise on that. Therefore, I have taken out some time specifically for you so that we can have a conversation about your progress.

So, tell me, what is your progress? What are your plans to achieve the target of the month? Are you facing any challenges?
30/1/24, 10:24 AM - +263 71 987 5652: Thank you mentor

And also I want to pursue the video call with my decision makers of my former schools so that I balance all my projects. With that you say it you are going to communicate with the team so I'm still waiting for your prominent  response! <This message was edited>

In the meantime, we have two projects for you to embark upon - Project 2 (Community Building)  and Project 3 (African School Education Reform Mission). These projects present fantastic opportunities for you to showcase your skills, earn scholarship credits, and make a significant impact.🪄
