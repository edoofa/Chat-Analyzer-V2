23/1/24, 11:24 AM - Ananya Edoofa: *_🌟 URGENT UPDATE 🌟_*

Tinotenda, guess what? I'm super excited to share some awesome news – next month, we're planning a trip to Africa! 🌍 Yep, you heard it right! Our team is coming to your town. Just like last year, our students will be helping us organize the event, and we're looking for volunteers to join in and help manage everything! 🙌

Trust me, it will be an amazing experience with lots to learn! 🌈 Since planning this big event takes time and effort, our team will be so tight. 

In light of this, I'm proposing a slight adjustment to our session timetable. *Today, we won't be having our session as initially planned. However, worry not! I will soon share an updated timetable* and I am confident that together, we will create something truly extraordinary.
23/1/24, 11:29 AM - +263 77 534 5787: Noted thank you 😊
1/2/24, 2:53 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Tinotenda!

Remember the event I teased you about in Africa? Well, it's happening next month, and it's going to be massive – the biggest in Zimbabwe's history, with an expected crowd of *5000 people*! Surprising, isn't it? Get ready for an unforgettable experience! 🌍🎉

This time it is bigger and better! Our Founder & CEO, Mr. Angad along with our team, admission officers, and counselors whom all of you have met behind the screens— are up to share priceless insights that will shape your next four years in India.
1/2/24, 2:53 PM - Ananya Edoofa: *We'd like to reserve your seats in advance. Could you please let us know how many people you'll be coming with? This will help us allocate the right number of slots for you.*

I recommend bringing your parents and guardians to the event. They play a crucial role in your education decisions. This event offers them a chance to understand the program and witness the journeys of past students, providing valuable insights for your higher education journey in India. So, get ready for this epic adventure, and I'll share the details with you super soon!
1/2/24, 6:26 PM - +263 77 534 5787: I will be coming with my mother. So we have to reserve for 2
