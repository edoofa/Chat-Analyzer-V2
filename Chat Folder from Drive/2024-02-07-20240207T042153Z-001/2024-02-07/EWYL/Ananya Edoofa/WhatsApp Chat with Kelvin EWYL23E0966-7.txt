I wanted to share some exciting news with all of you. As you may have noticed, my schedule has been quite packed lately due to work commitments. The reason behind this is something truly special – our team has organized a three-day long industrial visit called SLICE CON' 24 for our Indian Edoofians! 🚀

During this event, we are fortunate to have the Co-founders and CEOs of prominent brands who will be present and sharing their invaluable experiences in one-on-one sessions. Yes, you read that right – they will be there live, right in front of us! What's even more thrilling is that a few of our students are presenting a presentation directly to these CEOs, showcasing why Africa, your homeland, is the best market for their products. 🤝
7/1/24, 8:47 PM - Ananya Edoofa: While I am filled with excitement for this event, please note that due to my involvement in the visit on the 8th, 9th, and 10th of January, our regular sessions won't be taking place on these days. When we connect on the 11th of January, I'll share my students' experiences and pictures with you. 📸✨
7/1/24, 8:50 PM - +27 71 707 0139: Good evening Ananya how are you today here we are good thank you

It has been observed that you have not been attending your sessions lately, nor following your EWYL ritual.

You know, we specifically allocate slots and time for you, and your non-attendance is truly disappointing and demotivating.

24/1/24, 10:42 AM - Ananya Edoofa: *_🌟 URGENT UPDATE 🌟_*

Kelvin, guess what? I'm super excited to share some awesome news – next month, we're planning a trip to Africa! 🌍 Yep, you heard it right! Our team is coming to your town. Just like last year, our students will be helping us organize the event, and we're looking for volunteers to join in and help manage everything! 🙌

Trust me, it will be an amazing experience with lots to learn! 🌈 Since planning this big event takes time and effort, our team will be so tight. 

In light of this, I'm proposing a slight adjustment to our session timetable. *As of now, we won't be having our session as initially planned. However, worry not! I will soon share an updated timetable* and I am confident that together, we will create something truly extraordinary.
24/1/24, 11:20 AM - +27 83 986 0810: Wow amazing, not a problem we will connect
25/1/24, 12:59 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Kelvin!

I have some exciting news to share with you. Tomorrow, we are going to celebrate Republic Day! Now, let me tell you a bit about it.

Republic Day is a special day in India. It's a time when we remember and celebrate the day our country adopted its Constitution. Just like a constitution helps guide a country, ours outlines the rules and principles that make India the diverse and vibrant place it is.

On Republic Day, we have a big parade in the capital city, where people from all over the country come together to showcase our culture, traditions, and achievements. It's like a colorful and lively show with music, dance, and different displays. The Indian flag is hoisted, and everyone sings the national anthem with pride.

People also fly kites, dress up in traditional clothes, and enjoy delicious food! 🇮🇳✨

However, this time it’s different! It’s a mega event that has never happened in the history of Zimbabwe, as we are expecting a crowd of 5000 people! Surprising, isn't it?

Now, we understand that you and your parents must have a lot of questions in your mind as you are in the middle of your University admission process. Therefore, keeping this in mind, along with Mr. Angad, our admissions team, and our counselors will be there as well to address all of your concerns!
1/2/24, 4:09 PM - Ananya Edoofa: So, bring your parents along, and don't miss your chance to expedite your admission process. Not only that, get ready to dive into the opportunities you are going to experience when you are here in India, as Mr. Angad himself is going to walk you through the journey of being an Edoofian. After all, only 6 months are left! So, get ready for this epic adventure, and I'll share the details with you super soon! ⚡
