1/2/24, 2:13 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Kundai, I understand about your school timings however it is crucial for you to finish your EWYL orientation with me, as mentioned earlier. If you are not able to do that, you can ask your parents to attend the session with me and understand the basics of the program.

This will ensure a smooth process, and we can later connect on the projects only. Please let me know if you proceed in this manner.
1/2/24, 4:29 PM - +263 71 256 8023: Yes , we can proceed .My parents can be in touch with you

Let us begin our session with an amazing fact! 

_*Did you know that a day on Venus is actually longer than a year on Venus? Even though it only takes Venus about 225 Earth days to go around the sun, it spins really slowly, taking about 243 Earth days to turn once on its axis. So, a day on Venus is longer than a whole year there! 🫨*_
5/2/24, 2:37 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Kundai, I was expecting a response from your end, may I ask why didn't you attend your session?
5/2/24, 3:38 PM - +263 71 256 8023: Good afternoon, lm sorry ,l was at school
5/2/24, 3:59 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Mercy, While I understand that you are attending your school, however  it is crucial for you to finish your EWYL orientation with me, as mentioned earlier. If you are not able to do that, you can ask your parents to attend the session with me and understand the basics of the program.

This will ensure a smooth process, and we can later connect on the projects only. Please let me know if you proceed in this manner.

6/2/24, 2:01 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Moving ahead, I'd like to tell you about the *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
6/2/24, 2:03 PM - +263 77 242 6991: You can explain to me the key objectives.
6/2/24, 2:10 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
6/2/24, 2:10 PM - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
6/2/24, 2:16 PM - +263 77 242 6991: Well explained. I now understand the two objectives
6/2/24, 2:25 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
6/2/24, 2:30 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Well, now that our session time is over, let us connect in our next session which is tomorrow at the same time. 🚀
6/2/24, 2:33 PM - +263 77 242 6991: Ok have a nice day
