6/2/24, 9:22 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Great! Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*.

6/2/24, 9:23 AM - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
