5/2/24, 1:30 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Tendai!

Let us begin our session with an amazing fact! 

_*Did you know that a day on Venus is actually longer than a year on Venus? Even though it only takes Venus about 225 Earth days to go around the sun, it spins really slowly, taking about 243 Earth days to turn once on its axis. So, a day on Venus is longer than a whole year there! 🫨*_
5/2/24, 1:32 PM - +263 78 786 4935: A good afternoon to you,  Mrs Ananya are we yet to start our session
5/2/24, 1:33 PM - +263 78 786 4935: Intressting..
5/2/24, 1:40 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Indeed, Now, let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals. <This message was edited>
5/2/24, 1:40 PM - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
5/2/24, 1:42 PM - +263 78 786 4935: Oky
5/2/24, 1:48 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms. Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
5/2/24, 1:52 PM - +263 78 786 4935: Understood,  
Greetings Ms Dava and Ms Sanjana, 
That's if they available
5/2/24, 1:59 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure that will happen after we discuss all our projects in depth (not now), which will mandate us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
5/2/24, 2:02 PM - +263 78 786 4935: Yes
5/2/24, 2:08 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
5/2/24, 2:08 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
5/2/24, 2:18 PM - +263 78 786 4935: Am done
5/2/24, 2:21 PM - Ananya Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound?
5/2/24, 2:23 PM - +263 78 786 4935: Sounds great,  thank you a lot
5/2/24, 2:31 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
6/2/24, 10:00 AM - +263 78 786 4935: Good morning Mrs Ananya. As for my understandings about the document you sent me yesterday, the document enlighten us on how to be always aware, the skills we need to have to secure the jobs of the future and also introduce three projects a Edoofian can do to earn scholarship credits. As for the skills,  it mentioned new skills imagining in this current century,  which include Online skills and Social media literacy, Creative content writing, Data analysis and Remote team-work. It also mention basic skills which do not expire,  for example Relationship building, Risk-taking, Decision making and Empathy. 
The first project mentioned on the document which is Corporate Alliances,  talks about investigating on companies or organizations and connecting them with Edoofa. The second project is about connecting with people to give them an insight and an opportunity to be part of a bigger family, Edoofa.  As we all agree every one should be given an opportunity to better education. The third project is connecting with schools and introducing Edoofa to them,  and connecting them to the Edoofa.

It warns us on what should be put into consideration when selecting the right type of companies to associate with. What should be put into consideration includes the nature of the company, scale of company, financial stability and background of the founder. The document also give us insight on how to go through the process,  this includes how to use platforms like Google, Linkedlin,  crunchbase and lntershala to search for companies. It also give us an idea on how to communicate with the founders,  directors or managers of the companies.
