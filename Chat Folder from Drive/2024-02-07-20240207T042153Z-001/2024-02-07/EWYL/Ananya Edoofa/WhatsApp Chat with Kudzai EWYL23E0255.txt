Kudzai, guess what? I'm super excited to share some awesome news – next month, we're planning a trip to Africa! 🌍 Yep, you heard it right! Our team is coming to your town. Just like last year, our students will be helping us organize the event, and we're looking for volunteers to join in and help manage everything! 🙌

Trust me, it's going to be an amazing experience with lots to learn! 🌈 Since planning this big event takes proper time and effort, our team will be occupied so tight. Therefore, I was thinking of connecting only once a week for the time being.

Therefore, your new session timing will be *Every Tuesday, 12:00 p.m*. ⏰

Can't wait for this adventure together, see you tomorrow! 🚀

2/2/24, 10:20 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Good Morning, Kudzai!

As your mentor, I understand that circumstances led you to delay your higher education journey as of last year, after taking a significant step towards building your future through us and I am sure that you must have been in touch with our Admissions team to figure out the best available solutions for you. Since then, Edoofa has been on a journey of innovation, creating new opportunities for learning and growth for students like you!

While I was going through your conversation, It reminded me of how I started my education journey full of questions and aspirations, and therefore I wanted to check in and have a conversation about how are you doing currently. 
May I know how are you planning to move your journey ahead?
3/2/24, 7:33 AM - +27 67 242 8261: Hello @918800325457 hope you are well. 
The plans to move ahead are still in place and I'm still putting some money aside for this cause
3/2/24, 11:34 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Kudzai!

I really appreciate your efforts for your education. Can I know if you are in touch with the admissions team?
3/2/24, 10:18 PM - +27 67 242 8261: Hello my mentor. Im sorry for the late response it was a busy day for me. 
I last spoke to the admissions team informing them of my decision to push my studies to the next semester. I'm supposed to pay $200 for this and still yet to pay it
5/2/24, 3:49 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Kudzai!
