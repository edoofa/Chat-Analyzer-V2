16/1/24, 2:15 PM - +263 78 006 5624: Ok l will but as for now they are using my phone
16/1/24, 2:17 PM - Ananya Edoofa: That's alright! <This message was edited>
16/1/24, 2:17 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
16/1/24, 2:28 PM - +263 78 006 5624: Which are those two key objectives
16/1/24, 2:29 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
16/1/24, 2:30 PM - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
16/1/24, 2:32 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Now that our session time is over, let us conclude our session here, and remember, every effort you put in is a step closer to success. Keep participating, stay motivated, and earn those credits! You're all doing great, and I look forward to our continued journey together. See you next time!ac
17/1/24, 8:50 PM - +263 78 006 5624: Oooh ok l now understand the two key objectives
18/1/24, 1:32 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Mercy!

Kindly excuse me for not being able to connect with you yesterday. Unfortunately, due to bad health, I had to take a day off.
18/1/24, 1:44 PM - +263 78 006 5624: Oooh ok l get you so how are you feeling now
18/1/24, 1:52 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Thank you for asking, I am doing better now!
18/1/24, 1:53 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms. Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
18/1/24, 2:34 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I was hoping to hear from your end, however since our session time is over, let us connect in our next session now.
18/1/24, 3:26 PM - +263 78 006 5624: Ok thanks for the introduction
19/1/24, 1:34 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Mercy
Before beginning today's session, I want you to check out this incredible post :

https://www.instagram.com/p/CzVl_ADBbbz/?igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==
19/1/24, 1:41 PM - +263 78 006 5624: Greatings to you
19/1/24, 1:47 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Today,I would also like you to be informed of our program structure that will happen after we discuss all our projects in depth (not now), which will mandate us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
19/1/24, 1:50 PM - +263 78 006 5624: Yeah it sounds so interesting l just can't wait for this
19/1/24, 1:52 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.

As we embark on today's session, let's remember that every small effort contributes to significant progress. Let's take that first step together and make the most out of our time. Ready to dive in?

24/1/24, 1:53 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Now, I will start by explaining the projects in detail. I am sharing an audio file with you. Here’s my suggestion- listen to it at least twice, you know- to make sure we don’t miss anything out, and then get back to me when you are finished with the process!
24/1/24, 1:53 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
24/1/24, 2:23 PM - +263 78 006 5624: Ok it's fine but allow to reply you at 5:00 PM because as for now I'm at work
24/1/24, 2:26 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Mercy, While I understand and appreciate that you are working to finance your education, it is crucial for you to finish your EWYL orientation with me, as mentioned earlier. If you are not able to do that, you can ask your parents to attend the session with me and understand the basics of the program.

This will ensure a smooth process, and we can later connect on the projects only. Please let me know if you proceed in this manner.
24/1/24, 2:34 PM - +263 78 006 5624: My parents will also be at work trying to raise money for my education
24/1/24, 2:37 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Well, let's do one thing then! We can fast-track your orientation, and whenever you're free, you can resume from there. Is that alright?
24/1/24, 3:01 PM - +263 78 006 5624: Ok l get you
25/1/24, 1:37 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Mercy!

Let us begin our session with a fun fact: 

The tongue of a blue whale, the largest animal on Earth, can weigh as much as an elephant. Despite their massive size, blue whales primarily feed on tiny shrimp-like animals called krill, using their enormous tongues to filter them from the water.🐋
25/1/24, 1:50 PM - +263 78 006 5624: Wow interesting
25/1/24, 1:50 PM - +263 78 006 5624: Greetings to you
25/1/24, 1:53 PM - Ananya Edoofa: So, Mercy did you get a chance to listen to the audio?
25/1/24, 2:35 PM - Ananya Edoofa: You did not attend the session today as well, however let me highlight that we will continue our conversation on Monday as we do not have our sessions over the weekend. Also, tomorrow, we won't be having our session as it's Republic Day in India. Wishing you a happy Republic Day! It's a special day when we celebrate the adoption of our constitution.

_*Did you know that a day on Venus is actually longer than a year on Venus? Even though it only takes Venus about 225 Earth days to go around the sun, it spins really slowly, taking about 243 Earth days to turn once on its axis. So, a day on Venus is longer than a whole year there! 🫨*_
