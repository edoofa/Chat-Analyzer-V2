I hope you all are doing well.

Edoofa has provided me with such an amazing opportunity to earn and learn. I feel honored to be a part of the EWYL Program and it has been a very learning journey for me as I have been given a platform where I can earn along with so many skills. With the help of our counselors, and my mentor <NAME OF THE MENTOR>, I have come this way and want to go on for a long time. And with all this, I want to redeem the credits I have earned so far with the help of the EWYL Program.

I know from the past few days, that I could not respond but allow me to share a story very close to my heart🫰🏻

I became a part of Edoofa almost two years back with initial thoughts on how my relationship would be, will I be a good mentor, or will I be able to think like my students, and so on. With these thoughts, I began my journey. Honestly speaking, I learned a lot each day, and yes, made some mistakes but I did not know that now there is going something that I will cherish for my lifetime, our bond. In this journey so far, I have guided more than 500 students, and beyond guidance I have made sure that I can create a transformation in their lives🌟
25/1/24, 2:50 PM - Saloni Edoofa: As an individual, I always believe that the learning process is life never ends and the more you learn, the better the guidance becomes, with a heavy heart, *I've chosen to immerse myself in higher education, and as a result, I'll be taking a step back from being your mentor🥺*
*You have a special place in my heart, and I am profoundly thankful for the honor of being your mentor*. Our journey doesn't end here; it merely takes a different course. I have full confidence in your continued success.

*I want to assure you that the Department of Student DSW) team will reach out to you soon to discuss the upcoming plan and ensure a seamless transition.*
All the best🫶🏻
