29/12/23, 3:19 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day,

You know when I was a student and till now, I make agendas on what I wish to achieve in life this year, and how I can transform it for the betterment of not just myself, but my family and the people around me. Honestly, some targets seemed achievable, but I always kept a few that made me thrive beyond my boundaries to achieve them.
I, as your wellwisher and companion, wish you that you also push yourself and make the most of the opportunities that are coming your way starting from the EWYL Program that offers you a chance to *stand on your own feet*. Next year, _we will be a few months away from our flight to India_✈️, and I want to see you living a journey till that time that is filled with *hard work and dedication*. I have personally curated this message from the bottom of my heart to wish you a very *Happy New Year, 2024* 🫶🏻

3/1/24, 8:38 AM - Saloni Edoofa: Good day to each wonderful member of our group!

As we embark on this new year, I want to extend my heartfelt wishes for a joyous NEW YEAR 2024🌟 filled with good health, peace, success, thrilling adventures, and a remarkable academic journey that awaits you🫶🏻.

I am genuinely excited to hear about your New Year celebrations and any resolutions you've set for yourself. Whether they involve personal growth, academic achievements, or new experiences, I am eager to support and celebrate your journey throughout the year🎯.
3/1/24, 8:38 AM - Saloni Edoofa: May I know when we can begin with our regular sessions?

4/1/24, 4:22 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Good day, Rodwell!

Alright Rodwell, please drop a message in the group once you are available.
27/1/24, 8:33 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Good day!
I hope you're doing well.

I know from the past few days, that I could not respond but allow me to share a story very close to my heart🫰🏻

I became a part of Edoofa almost two years back with initial thoughts on how my relationship would be, will I be a good mentor, or will I be able to think like my students, and so on. With these thoughts, I began my journey. Honestly speaking, I learned a lot each day, and yes, made some mistakes but I did not know that now there is going something that I will cherish for my lifetime, our bond. In this journey so far, I have guided more than 500 students, and beyond guidance I have made sure that I can create a transformation in their lives🌟
27/1/24, 8:33 PM - Saloni Edoofa: As an individual, I always believe that the learning process is life never ends and the more you learn, the better the guidance becomes, with a heavy heart, *I've chosen to immerse myself in higher education, and as a result, I'll be taking a step back from being your mentor🥺*
*You have a special place in my heart, and I am profoundly thankful for the honor of being your mentor*. Our journey doesn't end here; it merely takes a different course. I have full confidence in your continued success.

*I want to assure you that the Mentorship team will reach out to you soon to discuss the upcoming plan and ensure a seamless transition.*
All the best🫶🏻
27/1/24, 8:42 PM - +263 71 898 7559: I has been such an honour to work with you and I'm so grateful at this moment of everything that you were teaching me especially of being *creative* .... It is such  an emotional massage that you shared.... it is very hard for me but sometimes we have to face reality but I again thank you so much for everything that you have given me  I really appreciate you such a kind mentor..... *I wish best of luck to your new chapter you will always be remembered*
27/1/24, 8:48 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Rodwell, I want to say openly that you have been my best student so far. With the kind of respect I have received from you, your attention to detail, your active participation, your growth, and a hundred more such attributes always made me contribute multifold. I absolutely love you honestly, I am so emotional right now reading your message, these are some of the best parting messages a mentor can receive🥺🫶🏻
28/1/24, 12:00 AM - +263 71 898 7559: It's so touching but good luck to your new chapter... I will always appreciate everything that I taught me my mentor
28/1/24, 12:00 AM - +263 71 898 7559: You taught me ***
29/1/24, 2:24 PM - Sanjana Edoofa: Good Afternoon Rodwell,
I trust this message finds you well. Today, I want to take a moment to celebrate the exceptional bond that has been fostered between you and your former mentor, Ms. Saloni. We truly appreciate the positive impact she has had on your journey with us.

As the Head of the Department, I want to assure you that it is our top priority to ensure a smooth transition for you and to maintain the momentum of your learning and growth. While we are actively searching for a new mentor to guide you further, I have taken up the responsibility of being available to you in case of any queries or assistance required.

Moving forward, I have a very exciting new update to share with you, which would be a big milestone for you on your personal journey with Edoofa
29/1/24, 2:46 PM - +263 71 898 7559: Good afternoon how are you doing. To be honest it has been such an honour to work and learn with Ms Saloni she was so kind and I thank her for that I'm looking forward for the new mentor hopefully she/ He will have the same traits just like Ms Saloni and I'm very excited to hear the new update that you want to share with me
29/1/24, 3:27 PM - Sanjana Edoofa: *Good afternoon Rodwell,*
I am thrilled to share some incredible news with you - after careful consideration and discussions about your performance in the EWYL Program, you have been selected to take on *the role of Event Coordinators for Edoofa's upcoming Meet & Greet in Zimbabwe* that is due in a few days! Congratulations on this well-deserved opportunity!🥳

This is no ordinary event; _we are expecting a gathering of 5000 people_, and we believe in your ability to not just meet but exceed the responsibilities that come with this role. ⭐

This role is not mandatory but rather an invitation for you to explore and consider. As one of the Event Coordinators, it's a chance for you to showcase your *leadership skills, problem-solving abilities, and creativity* on a grand scale. Apart from this, you will also have the golden opportunity to *collaborate with Edoofa’s Team, work closely with Mr. Angad Singh,* and contribute significantly to the success of this huge event! 🎯
I know you must be feeling butterflies in your stomach, along with a lot of questions in your mind. Well, to clear all your doubts regarding this opportunity we have scheduled *a video call with all the students who have been given this opportunity tomorrow* and the timings for the same will be also shared tomorrow itself. If you have any questions or if there's anything you'd like to discuss, please note it down so that it can be addressed over the call.🚨

Congratulations once again, and let's make this event an unforgettable experience for everyone involved!💯✨
29/1/24, 7:11 PM - +263 71 898 7559: The video call will be scheduled tomorrow at what time ... How many students will be there approximately
29/1/24, 7:15 PM - +263 71 898 7559: It's sounds amazing and I'm looking forward to it .. And I'm also ready to meet my fellow edoofians
30/1/24, 10:05 AM - Sanjana Edoofa: ⭐*Good morning, Anik!*⭐
I hope you are having a lovely morning, and if not so get ready to create one! I have especially created a voice message to share my energy and excitement with you regarding your selection as of our event coordinators. As discussed yesterday, I have also shared the timings with you so, go ahead and listen to the audio carefully!🚀⭐
30/1/24, 10:08 AM - +263 71 898 7559: Good morning how are you... I'm looking forward for the voice massage can you please share it
30/1/24, 10:08 AM - Sanjana Edoofa: <Media omitted>

30/1/24, 2:42 PM - +263 71 898 7559: Good afternoon I'm unable to connect...I think it requires internet data which I don't have .... for now I don't have wifi
30/1/24, 3:24 PM - Sanjana Edoofa: I see, Rodwell, kindly ensure you are prepared with bundles for the next meeting, since a lot was covered in today's session, and I don't want you to miss out on any important information
30/1/24, 3:34 PM - Sanjana Edoofa: I understand you were unable to join the call today due to certain challenges. However, since you have shown enthusiasm for this role and for our event, I thought I'd personally reach out to you and bring you upto speed about the discussion I had yesterday with all the students who have been chosen to become a coordinator along with you. Together, you and your co-Edoofians shall be managing an event that would have a footfall of around *5000 participants*. This will undoubtedly be one of the biggest events you ever attend in your academic or professional life. This is the first time that an event of such scale is being conducted in Zimbabwe. In fact, you'd be surprised to know that we had to really struggle to find a suitable venue for such a big event in all of Harare. 

Now, while I know that it is challenging for you to attend each training session, I would not want you to miss out on the oppurtunity of being a part of this mega event, so please do try and participate in as many training calls and sessions in the upcoming days as you can- there will be a lot to learn!! I look forward to seeing you soon!
30/1/24, 8:11 PM - +263 71 898 7559: Oky I will do my best ... I will try to find the best solution
30/1/24, 8:15 PM - +263 71 898 7559: Oky noted thank you so much I'm so sad that I failed to join I thought it was through WhatsApp and I also failed to raise some of my questions ... but I will try to attend next time since I have Learned from this ...
31/1/24, 7:56 AM - Sanjana Edoofa: Good morning, Rodwell. I look forward to connecting with you in today's call
