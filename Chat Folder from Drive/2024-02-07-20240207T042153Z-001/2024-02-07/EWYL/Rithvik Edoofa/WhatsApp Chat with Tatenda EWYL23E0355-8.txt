6/1/24, 1:49 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: _*Good Afternoon my lovely student*_
I wanted to share some exciting news with you. As you may have noticed, my schedule has been quite packed lately due to work commitments. The reason behind this is something truly special – our team has organized a three-day long industrial visit called *SLICE CON' 24* for our Indian Edoofians! 🚀

During this event, *we are fortunate to have the Co-founders and CEOs of prominent brands* who will be present and sharing their invaluable *experiences in one-on-one sessions.* Yes, you read that right – they will be there live, right in front of us! What's even more thrilling is that a few of our students are presenting a presentation directly to these CEOs, showcasing why Africa, your homeland, is the best market for their products. 🤝
6/1/24, 1:49 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: While I am filled with excitement for this event, please note that due to my involvement in the visit on the *8th, 9th, and 10th of January*, our regular sessions won't be taking place on these days. 

*When we connect on the 11th of January at 7::00 pm,* I'll share my students' experiences and pictures with you. 📸✨

*Now, Since it will be a long break, I want you to work hard on the projects and submit 7 applications to me on Thursday.* 
Give it your 100% and I know you can do this. Take care
6/1/24, 2:20 PM - +263 71 910 8435: Good afternoon ma'am
6/1/24, 2:20 PM - +263 71 910 8435: OK ma'am I will be looking forward to see the pictures

Kindly excuse me for the delay in my response. Following the event, I experienced a fever and had to be on bed rest for a couple of days.

Let me share the scoop on *Slice Con'24—it was seriously awesome!* The event was nothing short of extraordinary, providing students with a wealth of exposure and valuable insights. 🚀
Throughout the event, students actively engaged with CEOs, asking insightful questions and gaining a deeper understanding of various industries. The *AI sessions* were particularly enlightening, offering a glimpse into the cutting-edge advancements in technology and some amazing AI Tools🤖

But wait, there's more! They also played games and made some great memories. It was a total win-win—fun and educational at the same time. Here is a glimpse of how it went, looking forward to when you will also get this chance to be here and experience these amazing things🤩❤️

Now, till the time you are not assigned with a new mentor, I personally wanted to make sure that your growth and learning journey have not hit a pause and you are able to earn the Scholarship credits that I understand hold a great value in your journey. So today, I'm stepping in to assist you. If you're facing any challenges in your projects or if there are concerns you'd like to address, feel free to share them with me. Your success is our priority, and I'm here to support you every step of the way.

2/2/24, 4:43 PM - Rithvik Edoofa: Exclusive Invite to Edoofa's Mega Meet & Greet in Harare! 🌟
2/2/24, 4:43 PM - Rithvik Edoofa: Hi Tatenda,

I'm Mr. Rithvik, HOD of the Department of Student Welfare at Edoofa. Exciting news – you're officially invited to our massive Meet and Greet Event in Harare this February!


As the countdown to your 🇮🇳 India journey ticks away, with just a quarter left (approximately 3 to 4 months! 😄) before you step into this new adventure, I understand that the chaos and preparations might be swirling around you. Let's navigate through this excitement together. Here is an amazing opportunity for you as our Founder & CEO Mr. Angad, along with the admission officers and counselors (whom you have only met virtually until now, exciting right?) are coming to Zimbabwe for an exclusive annual meet & greet!
2/2/24, 4:43 PM - Rithvik Edoofa: With more than 5000 people participating, an event of this magnitude has never happened in Zimbabwe before. This meet & greet is going to be truly unique that Harare has ever seen. We present to you a fantastic opportunity for you to ask questions, address your concerns/queries, fast-track your admission process, and gain clarity about your journey to India. This event is just the beginning of a magical journey, offering you a glimpse into your future brimming with opportunities that would consist of discussions on industrial academia, the scope of your chosen field of study, and following your higher education.
2/2/24, 4:43 PM - Rithvik Edoofa: I would strongly recommend bringing your parents and guardians with you to the event! In your journey of life, they are the most integral part and of course decision-makers in your entire course of education. As you are just one step away from starting your higher education, this event would provide you with an opportunity to witness the path that unfolds for you in the next three to five years here in India - an opportunity for them to actively be a part of your potential journey, gain a deeper understanding towards the entire program and witness the journey of your senior Edoofians!
2/2/24, 4:43 PM - Rithvik Edoofa: Get ready for this adventure, and I'm genuinely happy that you're going to be part of such a phenomenal event! ✨
We'd like to reserve your seats in advance. Could you please let us know how many people you'll be coming with? This will help us allocate the right slots for you.
