I hope this message finds you in good spirits. I want to share some heartfelt news with you. After careful consideration, I've come to a decision that carries a mix of emotions. *I've chosen to immerse myself in higher education, and as a result, I'll be taking a step back from being your mentor.*

As we journey through this moment, I can't help but feel a mix of emotions realizing that our daily interactions are about to change. *Saying goodbye to our current way of connecting brings a bittersweet feeling*, but deep down, I see change as a chance for growth and the discovery of new opportunities.

Reflecting on our shared journey, I am truly humbled by the extraordinary moments we've experienced together—the bonds we've forged, the shared laughter, and the countless instances of mutual growth and learning.

Thank you for being an integral part of my life's journey. Keep radiating brilliance, dare to dream ambitiously, and always remember the remarkable potential within you. 
*I want to assure you that the mentorship team will reach out to you soon to discuss the upcoming plan and ensure a seamless transition.*
