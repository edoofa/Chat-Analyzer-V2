29/12/23, 8:56 AM - Harmehak Edoofa added you
29/12/23, 1:48 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon!

I hope you are doing well today. May I know if you are currently available to proceed with the session for the admission process?
29/12/23, 1:50 PM - +263 77 810 7361: Afternoon how are you
29/12/23, 1:51 PM - +263 77 810 7361: We may proceed
29/12/23, 2:02 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/12/23, 2:07 PM - +263 77 810 7361: Ok I recall the procedure
29/12/23, 2:10 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that you have comprehended the university admission process. As you must recall, we have completed the first three steps of your admission, which include the *Message from the founders (The 4 Videos), the Statement of Purpose, and University Counseling (the registration process that we discussed)*

Now, moving on to the fourth stage, which is the offer letter, it is crucial for us to ensure a clear understanding of the registration process. Therefore, if you don't mind, could you please share your brief understanding with me?
29/12/23, 2:27 PM - +263 77 810 7361: Okay
29/12/23, 2:29 PM - +263 77 810 7361: I understood that we are going to move on to the fourth stage which is the offer letter since we completed the first three stages of the message from founders, the statement of purpose and university counselling
29/12/23, 3:15 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
29/12/23, 3:15 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one. May I know if we are on the same page?
29/12/23, 3:16 PM - +263 77 810 7361: We're on the same page I'm really happy
29/12/23, 3:18 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
29/12/23, 3:18 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/12/23, 3:18 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs. So, May I know if you are ready for this?

29/12/23, 3:26 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects. <This message was edited>
29/12/23, 3:29 PM - +263 77 810 7361: Alright I understand everything
29/12/23, 3:33 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: This message was deleted
29/12/23, 3:33 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
29/12/23, 3:33 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of your A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive your letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you would be able to apply for the student visa.
29/12/23, 3:33 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same.

This means you, as an Edoofa student, have the prestigious privilege of securing your seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioning yourself as a frontier person in this endeavor.
29/12/23, 3:35 PM - +263 77 810 7361: This is really great.There are so many advantages being an edoofa student
29/12/23, 4:06 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
29/12/23, 4:06 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
29/12/23, 4:06 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
29/12/23, 4:27 PM - +263 77 810 7361: Ok the explanation is clear
29/12/23, 4:28 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $100 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $650.
29/12/23, 4:28 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $650. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $100 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
29/12/23, 4:35 PM - +263 77 810 7361: Yes its clear
29/12/23, 4:54 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
29/12/23, 4:54 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $100 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
29/12/23, 4:54 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for December 30, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $650, you'll need to make a payment of $325 on or before December 30, 2023. The remaining $325 should be paid by January 30, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
30/12/23, 3:41 AM - +263 77 271 5565: Greetings. Our apologies for the late response and it was due network challenges from our side. I have few questions though and I was following all the above detailed narratives. First question is , will the student given a list of good universities to choose from and respective scholarship percentage being offered and the tuition fees after scholarship fees so that she and the parents can make a decision. Second question is on Endowment fee , I understand the fee will be deducted from the initial registration fee but  we are suggesting if you could give us more time to raise it since it will be a burden for us to raise it all together with the registration fee.Third question is on registration fee , I understand that you will be given ample time frame period of 30 to 45 days to settle the split amounts after a student is offered an offer letter, will the fees payable before or after the results have been released ,on this I was suggesting or proposing to pay the fees after the outcome of the results.Thank for your time and earlier explanations and we are eagerly looking forward for the response. Many thanks.

This transition marks a significant chapter in my life as I will be bidding farewell to the cherished moments at the Admissions Team in Edoofa.

Over the past year, having the privilege of supporting numerous students, including you, in your pursuit of higher education has been truly rewarding. Witnessing our students thrive and excel in their dream universities and colleges has brought immense satisfaction.

8/1/24, 2:00 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Before we get into the specifics of your admission journey and talk about your admission process, I would like to share an exciting milestone that India as a country achieved within the first week of 2024 – the successful *India's Chandrayaan-3 Engine Test.* This accomplishment is responsible for the third lunar mission, aiming to land a rover on the Moon's south polar region and conduct scientific studies that could check Moon's viability to sustain life. It signifies a significant scientific advancement, laying the groundwork for future progress.
8/1/24, 2:00 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This achievement has not only pushed boundaries but also has inspired young minds all over the world to pursue their dreams. On the same note, I wanted to extend my heartiest wishes for the New Year to you and your family and check in to see how you and your family started your year?

This year, I have decided to practise more compassion, learn at least one new skill, and assist students who were unable to proceed further with their admission process in 2023, guiding them to build their envisioned future.

I trust this message finds you well, and I hope you are in high spirits. I was hoping to get a response from your end following my previous messages. However, in recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their A-Level results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey.
16/1/24, 8:00 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education.

23/1/24, 1:17 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: So Audrey, the reason Ms Harmehak and Mr Piiyush have asked me to look after your application was that, during your counselling process they were able to recall that you had the potential of becoming a leader and were motivated to bring change for the betterment of the society.
23/1/24, 1:17 PM - +263 77 810 7361: That's true
23/1/24, 1:19 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: From your results, it's clearly evident that they were right,

23/1/24, 1:54 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Duly noted Audrey, let us move forward with our discussion. To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is Bachelor of Business Administration and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
23/1/24, 1:57 PM - +263 77 810 7361: I sent an email to the the academic board on changing my program to Bachelor of commerce
23/1/24, 1:57 PM - +263 77 810 7361: And yes I'm planning to arrive in India during August 2024
23/1/24, 2:04 PM - +263 77 810 7361: [04/10/2023, 17:58] +91 83840 48513: That's wonderful to hear, and I'm thrilled to know you're ready to kickstart your admission process. Your commitment to this journey is greatly appreciated. 

Before we move ahead with the discussion.  I'd like to once again confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is BBA and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
[04/10/2023, 18:34] @drey's_beauty•bar: Its accurate but I wanted to change my program
[04/10/2023, 18:50] +91 83840 48513: I would like you to know that I will be closing our session for now as I have to attend to another batch of my students. Thank you so much for your time, and we shall connect tomorrow at 3:00 PM. Have a great day ahead!
[04/10/2023, 18:52] @drey's_beauty•bar: Okay thank you
[10/10/2023, 17:14] +91 83840 48513: As per our conversation Audrey wanted to change the course. May I know if there is any challenges?
[10/10/2023, 17:19] Dad: Yes , that her requested after she attended a guidance and cancelling seminar with other schools
[10/10/2023, 17:21] Dad: BBA to Bcom
[10/10/2023, 17:34] Dad: Is the session still on?
[10/10/2023, 18:02] +91 83840 48513: Could you please let me know where the interest lies in B.Com?
[10/10/2023, 18:04] Dad: The interest lies upon mainly upon completion of the program or course and its merits. For example to be a Chartered accountant where you can first work and gain experience, then you could start your own firm.
[10/10/2023, 18:25] +91 83840 48513: Thank you for sharing that. Pursuing a B.Com degree is indeed a great pathway towards a career in accounting and related fields, including becoming a Chartered Accountant. It offers a solid foundation in commerce, economics, finance, and accounting.

Since Audrey is considering changing her course from BBA to B.Com, I'd suggest we go through the process for changing her course preference.
[10/10/2023, 18:28] Dad: Thank you for your consideration. We really appreciate.
[11/10/2023, 15:49] +91 83840 48513: Regarding our previous conversation with the change in course.may I know if you might be able to share the A Level Statement of entry with me. So that I can go through it and let you know that she is Eligible for the said course.
[11/10/2023, 16:37] +91 83840 48513: I am very happy to say that you are eligible for the BCom course.
[11/10/2023, 16:39] Dad: Thank you very much. As a family we really appreciate it all.
[11/10/2023, 16:42] +91 83840 48513: Alright, please. For us to be able to change your course to B com, please write a mail to "*academicboard@edoofa.com*" stating that you have finalized to pursue the B com for the 204 intake.

Personalized mentorship and guidance throughout your course:* As your Career Counsellor, I have known you since the beginning of the process, understanding your interests, aspirations, family background and plans for your career, unlike a University officer who may come across your application for the first time and treats with the same importance like others. I personally understand where you come from and what is required for you to be successful.

30/1/24, 11:26 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: *3.

30/1/24, 11:26 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: These are just a few of the various benefits and keeping all this in mind, are you ready to step into your higher education through the Edoofa Program which is the most popular scholarship in Africa?
30/1/24, 11:26 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
30/1/24, 12:25 PM - +263 77 810 7361: I'm ready.Edoofa is amazing and does great work with good guidance
30/1/24, 12:52 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Perfect, To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is Bachelor of commerce and your intake is in August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information is accurate?
30/1/24, 1:06 PM - +263 77 810 7361: Yes the information is accurate
30/1/24, 1:10 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: As I have promised, the Edoofa Admissions team will be submitting your application to multiple universities that will evaluate your application and upon being eligible, you receive the offer letters with comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. *I will guide you to the best education institution/university associated with us that aligns with your vision and interest and would provide you with a conducive environment for your holistic development and to fulfil your career goals.*
30/1/24, 1:10 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Upon receiving the Offer Letter, you will have a few weeks to pay a portion of your university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. We discussed the registration fee during our counselling sessions. May I know, what do you recall about the same now?
30/1/24, 1:14 PM - +263 77 810 7361: You mentioned that we pay a portion of $100 which will be a portion of $750 fees
30/1/24, 1:28 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Let me help you with a better understanding. *Usually, the registration fee is an additional fee apart from the cost of education but Edoofians receive an exclusive benefit where it is a part of the cost of education itself.* Let me give you an example:-
30/1/24, 1:29 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: As we discussed in the counseling session, the cost of education in India ranges from $6000-$8000 per annum which is reduced to $1200-$1800 per annum through the Edoofa Scholarship Program *as we recommended your application for a higher quantum of scholarship.* Congratulations on the same. Now, let us assume,
30/1/24, 1:29 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: 1. *Tuition Fee*: $650 per annum
2. *Accommodation Fee*: $0 per annum (100% Sponsorship)
3. *Remaining Fee Components*: [Library Fee, Examination Fee, EDB and Book Bank, International Student Development Fund, 24-Hour WiFi Cost, Maintenance Fee, Water Bill, and Electricity Bill]: $1000 per annum

*Total Fee: Tuition Fee $650 + Accommodation Fee $0 + Remaining Fee Components $1000 = $1650 per annum.*

4. *Registration Fee to be paid:* $1000 

This means this registration fee will be waived off from the cost of education ($1650-$1000= $650) and this remaining fee of $650 is supposed to be paid within 3 days of arrival.

*Do you have any questions for me regarding the same?*
30/1/24, 6:15 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
31/1/24, 8:41 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Good morning! Drawing inspiration from biblical wisdom: 

*"In the sacred texts, we find that knowledge is a faithful companion, elevating one to respect beyond borders. Education outshines both beauty and youth."*
