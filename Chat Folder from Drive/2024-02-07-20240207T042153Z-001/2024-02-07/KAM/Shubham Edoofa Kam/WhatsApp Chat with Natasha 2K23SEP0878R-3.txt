23/1/24, 11:36 AM - +260 96 9875838: I wish to change because the percentage of the course is too small
23/1/24, 11:36 AM - +260 96 9875838: And I would like to go for civil engineering
23/1/24, 11:46 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Duly noted and I totally understand that, You are certainly eligible for course change, and can be provided with a higher quantum of scholarship as well, Natasha <This message was edited>
