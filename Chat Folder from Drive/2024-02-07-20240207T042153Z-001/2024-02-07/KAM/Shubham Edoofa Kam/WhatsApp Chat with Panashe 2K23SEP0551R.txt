I trust this message finds you well, and I hope you are in high spirits. In recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their A-Level results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey.
16/1/24, 11:43 AM - Kirti Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?

Hence I have asked my Colleague *Mr Shubham* to personally look after your admission process so that we can proceed with your application on priority.

1/2/24, 3:02 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: I am shocked to compile these data for Fee Structures of some famous Public Universities of Zimbabwe.

*Bindura University of Science Education (BUSE)* -https://www.buse.ac.zw/fees-structure/ - *($680 per term)*

*Chinhoyi University of Technology (CUT)* https://www.cut.ac.zw/welcome/assets/files/fees-structure/School%20of%20Engineering%20Science.pdf - *($535 per term)*

NUST -*($870 per term)*
1/2/24, 3:02 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Let me help you understand the Situation in Zimbabwe in much more detail

While the cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, the cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal which is Sadza and curry costs a student $1 one time and you are aware of this better. The cost of *Accommodation, Food, Wifi, stationery, gadgets, transport* etc is an additional expense for a student. The initial registration fee for the Zimbabwean Universities ranges from *$20-$75 without the guarantee of being eligible or not.* The *attachment fee before graduation ranges from $200 or more.*
1/2/24, 3:02 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Let me tell you, I was caught in surprise when I compared it with the Edoofa Scholarship Program, not because of affordability but the opportunity to acquire skills, knowledge and be employable. Speaking about Employability, do you feel Zimbabwe is ready to equip the graduates with job opportunities in their aspired fields?
1/2/24, 3:52 PM - +263 77 984 5767: No most people here are unemployed
1/2/24, 4:04 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: So why do you want to study in a local university then?
1/2/24, 4:12 PM - +263 77 984 5767: Because last time we had a discussion I had only gotten  a 50% scholarship and my parents would have to send the remaining amount plus accommodation and having to send the money abroad also carries some charges
1/2/24, 4:16 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: I understand Panashe, I have been interacting with the board regarding your application 
for the following courses, and you are eligible for a higher quantum of scholarship:

1. B.Sc in Medical Lab Technology
2. B.Sc in BioTechnology
