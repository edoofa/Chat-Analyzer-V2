16/1/24, 12:13 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Lynn

I trust this message finds you well, and I hope you are in high spirits. In recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their A-Level results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey.
16/1/24, 12:13 PM - Ashi Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?
16/1/24, 12:15 PM - +263 77 189 0220: I do not have the official results yet but I googled them online,they are not yet available at school
16/1/24, 12:15 PM - +263 77 189 0220: <Media omitted>
16/1/24, 7:04 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your results, and congratulations on successfully clearing all your A-Level subjects! Your hard work over the past few months has truly paid off.

I am sure your family is immensely proud of your achievements. Your A-level results have been duly noted, and we will quickly add them to your scholarship application. This will enable us to engage in discussions with the academic board and chart the best course of action for your next steps.
16/1/24, 7:05 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Kindly allow us time till Monday to thoroughly evaluate your results and plan the way forward. Once we have re-evaluated your application, along with all the other applications, Mr. Shubham, the senior career counselor at Edoofa will connect with you to guide you on the next steps in your academic career.

24/1/24, 8:24 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: We were overwhelmed and had to reject more applications because of limited seats, however were surely intrigued to know the reasons for such an immediate upsurge.  Having Conversations with my other students who are already preparing to arrive in India under the Edoofa Scholarship shared some mind-boggling Screenshots from the Fee Prospectus of the Universities in Zimbabwe.

24/1/24, 8:25 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: I am shocked to compile these data for Fee Structures of some famous Public Universities of Zimbabwe.

*Bindura University of Science Education (BUSE)* -https://www.buse.ac.zw/fees-structure/ - *($680 per term)*

*Chinhoyi University of Technology (CUT)* https://www.cut.ac.zw/welcome/assets/files/fees-structure/School%20of%20Engineering%20Science.pdf - *($535 per term)*

*University of Zimbabwe (UZ)* -https://www.uz.ac.zw/index.php/faculties/160-fac-of-medicine/med-deparrtments/305-med-dpt-of-comm *($523 per term)*

NUST -*($870 per term)*
24/1/24, 8:25 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: *I am sure you and your family must have also discussed this,*. So what have you decided for your future ahead?
24/1/24, 10:18 AM - +263 77 189 0220: My parents haven't decided anything yet as they are trying their best to allocate me to an affordable university
24/1/24, 11:30 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: So after looking at the facts shared above what do you think is more advantageous, to study at a globally recognized university abroad with an abundance of exposure and opportunities or to study at a local university where you will have no guarantee if you would get a job or not? <This message was edited>
24/1/24, 11:37 AM - +263 77 189 0220: Of course a globally recognised university is more advantageous sir
24/1/24, 12:40 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: That's great to hear!
24/1/24, 12:41 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: That is absolutely understandable and thank you for sharing. Being a senior academican and counsellor, my aspirations for young learners like you are similar. I firmly believe higher education should combine the following for a learner to achieve their goals:-

Quality Education
Conducive Environment
Critical Thinking and Practical learning skills
Technological Literacy and Attachments
Cultural Awareness and Global Perspective
Career guidance, Mentorships, etc.

*However, not everyone achieves success. Do you know why*?
24/1/24, 12:45 PM - +263 77 189 0220: Because they would be lacking some of the above mentioned qualities perhaps <This message was edited>
24/1/24, 12:52 PM - +263 77 189 0220: Though when I started researching about the Edoofa Scholarship I honestly thought that since it's a 90 % scholarship, Edoofa would be paying most of my fees and making my dream of a higher education come true however the  fees that have been mentioned by Galgotias University do not show much about how Edoofa is helping with my fees though the counselling session are exciting and the Earn While You Learn Program is an exercise one would never want to miss
24/1/24, 1:44 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: I understand Lynn

As a Senior Academician at the Edoofa Scholarship Program, I am here to offer you comprehensive support in planning for your education and guide you through the details. We understand that ensuring that you receive a quality education is a significant financial commitment, and we are here to help you make informed decisions for your brighter future.

30/1/24, 8:48 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Good morning!  let's draw inspiration from the timeless wisdom found in the Bible:

*"As the scriptures teach, knowledge is a steadfast companion. A person enlightened by wisdom is held in high regard across all realms. The brilliance of education surpasses the allure of beauty and the vigor of youth."*

30/1/24, 3:37 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Perfect, To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is Bachelor of Arts - Bachelor of Legislative Law and your intake is in August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information is accurate?

31/1/24, 8:37 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Good morning! Drawing inspiration from biblical wisdom: 

*"In the sacred texts, we find that knowledge is a faithful companion, elevating one to respect beyond borders. Education outshines both beauty and youth."*

Let's fuel our positive energy and continue our interactive session.
31/1/24, 9:34 AM - +263 77 189 0220: Great wisdom indeed
31/1/24, 9:34 AM - +263 77 189 0220: Good morning
31/1/24, 10:03 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: So before proceeding with the session, are there any questions you would like to ask?
31/1/24, 10:31 AM - +263 77 189 0220: I have been left unanswered for the past few days sir as those are the only questions I had, everything else is good
31/1/24, 11:20 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: I will be doing the same today
31/1/24, 11:20 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Let me help you with a better understanding. *Usually, the registration fee is an additional fee apart from the cost of education but Edoofians receive an exclusive benefit where it is a part of the cost of education itself.* Let me give you an example:-
31/1/24, 11:21 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: As we discussed in the counseling session, the cost of education in India ranges from $6000-$8000 per annum which is reduced to $1200-$1800 per annum through the Edoofa Scholarship Program *as we recommended your application for a higher quantum of scholarship.* Congratulations on the same. Now, let us assume,
31/1/24, 11:21 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: 1. *Tuition Fee*: $650 per annum
2. *Accommodation Fee*: $0 per annum (100% Sponsorship)
3. *Remaining Fee Components*: [Library Fee, Examination Fee, EDB and Book Bank, International Student Development Fund, 24-Hour WiFi Cost, Maintenance Fee, Water Bill, and Electricity Bill]: $1000 per annum

*Total Fee: Tuition Fee $650 + Accommodation Fee $0 + Remaining Fee Components $1000 = $1650 per annum.*

4. *Registration Fee to be paid:* $1000 

This means this registration fee will be waived off from the cost of education ($1650-$1000= $650) and this remaining fee of $650 is supposed to be paid within 3 days of arrival.

*Do you have any questions for me regarding the same?*
31/1/24, 12:19 PM - +263 77 189 0220: Okay I think I'm getting it a bit but are these fees for a year or a semester
31/1/24, 1:16 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Please for a Year Lynn
31/1/24, 1:50 PM - +263 77 189 0220: Okay clearly noted sir
31/1/24, 1:52 PM - +263 77 189 0220: Since I'm in for an August intake sir when am I going to be admitted into a proper university and most importantly how does the VISA and everything else work ,I mean the documentation of course
31/1/24, 2:24 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Please as soon as you complete the Registration formalitiies
31/1/24, 2:25 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: The registration fee can be paid either in two equal parts(The first half within 15 days and the second half within 30 days) or in one go itself.

Are you clear with the details?
31/1/24, 3:07 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Are we connected?
31/1/24, 3:20 PM - +263 77 189 0220: Yes noted sir
31/1/24, 3:26 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: So please ask your parents to come online now
31/1/24, 3:52 PM - +263 77 189 0220: I'm on it although my mom is at work right now
31/1/24, 3:52 PM - +263 77 189 0220: However for now I'm not in a position to pay any money because my parent's financial status is not that well
31/1/24, 3:56 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: I understand can you ask them to come online?
31/1/24, 3:59 PM - +263 77 189 0220: Noted sir
31/1/24, 6:35 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I will connect with you *tomorrow again at 09:00 AM CAT* to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care.

2/2/24, 12:05 PM - +267 75 503 983: There will be more processes to be done,and it needs money, as a single parent I thought getting a scholarship will help my child to study further  but to my surprise more  demands are coming, what of traveling documents, maybe I should enquire more about the processes through Indian embassy

6/2/24, 6:27 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: *Embrace education as the key to a brighter future. Proverbs 4:7 (NIV) wisely states, "The beginning of wisdom is this: Get wisdom." Seize the opportunity to break free from limitations. Keep in mind Philippians 4:13 (NIV), "I can do all this through him who gives me strength." Let education empower your child!*

Over the past few days, we've been trying to connect with you to discuss your child's academic journey. We understand the financial commitments involved in providing quality education for your child. The challenges in Africa, particularly the uncertainty of employment after completing a bachelor's degree, are evident.

Considering the urgency of your child's education, I've scheduled a session for *tomorrow at 09:30 AM CAT* .Looking forward to connecting with you tomorrow.
6/2/24, 8:45 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Good morning! let's draw inspiration from the timeless wisdom found in the Bible:

*Proverbs 1:5:*

*"Let the wise listen and add to their learning.' In the tapestry of progress, education is the thread that weaves nations together. As India seeks wisdom, let us prioritize education, creating a future where knowledge transcends boundaries and resonates more profoundly than ever. A commitment to learning is a commitment to a thriving, united nation."*

Let's continue our interactive session and embrace the transformative power of education
