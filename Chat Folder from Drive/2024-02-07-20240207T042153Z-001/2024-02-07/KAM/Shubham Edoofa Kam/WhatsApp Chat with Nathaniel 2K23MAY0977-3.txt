I hope this message finds you in good health and high spirits. It is a pleasure to reconnect with you today, and I am excited to share an important update with you.

Since our last discussion, the admissions team has been working diligently to process your scholarship application for universities in India under the Endowment plan. I am pleased to inform you that your application has been accepted by one of the leading universities, *Galgotias University* in India, and they have decided to offer you a scholarship.
10/1/24, 11:52 AM - Kirti Edoofa: The university will be mailing you the official offer letter shortly. However, since we received it in advance, we wanted to share this wonderful news with you and provide a head start on our discussions. I kindly request you to take your time to thoroughly review the letter. We will have a detailed discussion about its contents today at 06:00 PM.

In the meantime, I recommend that you make note of any questions or concerns that may arise as you review the letter. By setting a specific time, we can ensure that one of your family representatives will be available to connect with us.
10/1/24, 11:52 AM - Kirti Edoofa: This discussion will be an opportunity for me to assist you in gaining a better understanding of the remaining contents of your offer letter, addressing any queries you may have, and providing guidance on the requirements for the rest of your admission journey.

To schedule our discussion, please confirm your availability for the proposed time. If this time is not convenient for you, please share your availability within the window from 06:00 PM to 09:00 PM, and we will arrange a suitable connection time accordingly.

Congratulations to you and your family! ⭐ <This message was edited>

10/1/24, 6:05 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Nathaniel,

In light of the offer letter you received, I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to you and your family on this remarkable achievement in your academic journey.

Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion for you and your family, and I can only imagine the excitement that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.
10/1/24, 6:05 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you have the letter in your possession, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you've had the chance to go through the offer letter thoroughly? 

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
10/1/24, 10:23 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I was hoping to get a response from you, however, you did not respond, since it's been a long day for me, along with the conclusion of our working hours, let's plan to reconnect tomorrow to continue our discussion. I'm optimistic that you'll be able to connect then. Have a great night, and looking forward to our conversation tomorrow.
11/1/24, 6:29 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening parents and Nathaniel,

I trust you're well. I'm following up regarding the message I shared with you yesterday. I was expecting a reply, but it seems my messages might not have been received.

Therefore, I'm reaching out today to check if you had a chance to review my previous message and to confirm if we are still in communication?

13/1/24, 12:50 PM - +263 77 405 0858: I think it's fair to calculate the schoolarship percentage on results
15/1/24, 11:18 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Nathaniel.

I hope you are doing well. Thank you for sharing Nathaniel's results, and congratulations on successfully clearing all your A-Level subjects! Your hard work over the past few months has truly paid off.

I'm sure your family is immensely proud of your achievements. Your A-level results have been duly noted, and we will promptly add them to your scholarship application. This will enable us to engage in discussions with the academic board and chart the best course of action for your next steps.
15/1/24, 11:19 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you understand since your results came out yesterday only the re-evaluation will not be possible right now as it takes time since the university has already offered you a scholarship, plus considering that you have the endowment benefits right which is the $150 grant if you tend to wait for re-evaluation and continue to move forward with the standard admission process you will end up losing the endowment benefits. So my advice regarding your admission offer is to understand the letter better now because I will never want you to miss out on the endowment benefit.
16/1/24, 8:10 AM - +263 77 405 0858: Morning,l hope I have find you well,allow me to ask a question like this.Is Galgotias the only university in India?,is the owner of Microsoft attend this university ?. I feel betrayed.you would have given 3 option for univerties so that a student can choose the likes of LPU,CHAMG and PDM.However there no problem.may I have the address of your offices here in Zimbabwe.
16/1/24, 8:10 AM - +263 77 405 0858: I have two 2 kids who have enrolled with Edoofa you both offer them this Galgotias.l feel bettrayed your promises are never met up to now.

31/1/24, 9:44 AM - +263 77 405 0858: @918527919212 I am still trying to figure out how Edoofa alleviates the cost of tertiary education as touted from the start of counselling sessions.
31/1/24, 10:26 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: I did not get your questions please, Can yu further elaborate?
31/1/24, 10:31 AM - +263 77 390 2140: Please, share a breakdown of costs for studying in India under Edoofa. The same way you did with Zim universities so we can compare both sides. For now it seems Zim is cheaper and convenient for us
31/1/24, 11:21 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Let me assist you with the same
31/1/24, 11:22 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is B.Sc (Medical Lab Technology) and your intake is in August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information is accurate?
31/1/24, 11:26 AM - +263 77 405 0858: Yes
31/1/24, 11:26 AM - +263 77 405 0858: Accurate
31/1/24, 11:28 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: As I have promised, the Edoofa Admissions team will be submitting your application to multiple universities that will evaluate your application and upon being eligible, you receive the offer letters with comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. *I will guide you to the best education institution/university associated with us that aligns with your vision and interest and would provide you with a conducive environment for your holistic development and to fulfil your career goals.*

Upon receiving the Offer Letter, you will have a few weeks to pay a portion of your university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. We discussed the registration fee during our counselling sessions. May I know, what do you recall about the same now?
31/1/24, 11:35 AM - +263 77 390 2140: We will be very happy to get full information on all costs involved before we move on to pay more money. What we want is the best education at the least possible cost, be it in Zimbabwe or abroad
31/1/24, 12:33 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Let me help you with a better understanding. *Usually, the registration fee is an additional fee apart from the cost of education but Edoofians receive an exclusive benefit where it is a part of the cost of education itself.* Let me give you an example:-
31/1/24, 12:33 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: As we discussed in the counseling session, the cost of education in India ranges from $6000-$8000 per annum which is reduced to $1200-$1800 per annum through the Edoofa Scholarship Program *as we recommended your application for a higher quantum of scholarship.* Congratulations on the same. Now, let us assume,
31/1/24, 12:34 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: 1. *Tuition Fee*: $650 per annum
2. *Accommodation Fee*: $0 per annum (100% Sponsorship)
3. *Remaining Fee Components*: [Library Fee, Examination Fee, EDB and Book Bank, International Student Development Fund, 24-Hour WiFi Cost, Maintenance Fee, Water Bill, and Electricity Bill]: $1000 per annum
*Total Fee: Tuition Fee $650 + Accommodation Fee $0 + Remaining Fee Components $1000 = $1650 per annum.*
4. *Registration Fee to be paid:* $1000 
This means this registration fee will be waived off from the cost of education ($1650-$1000= $650) and this remaining fee of $650 is supposed to be paid within 3 days of arrival.

*Do you have any questions for me regarding the same?*
31/1/24, 3:07 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Are we connected?
31/1/24, 3:14 PM - +263 77 405 0858: Which university is this one
31/1/24, 3:16 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Please you will be informed about the same in the session ahead!
