16/1/24, 1:45 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Kibunda.

I hope you are doing well. I am *Ms. Kirti, an admissions officer here at Edoofa.* I will be assisting you in your journey ahead. I was able to go through your discussion with Mr. Milan and noticed that your main challenge is regarding the quality of the university may I know if my understanding so far is correct?
16/1/24, 1:48 PM - +260 96 9739802: Yes it is and you have been ignoring us why
16/1/24, 1:53 PM - Kirti Edoofa: We have not been ignoring you @260969739802 and I can completely understand what you must have felt as a parent. Kindly excuse us for that. We as an organization were involved in a really big event that was organised for our Edoofians. With great excitement and pride, I want to share that the Edoofa team has been immersed in an exciting event we had in store for our students. Edoofa hosted a conference - the Symposium of Leaders, Innovators, and Creators at Edoofa, also known as 'SLICE-CON.'
16/1/24, 1:53 PM - Kirti Edoofa: The conference was attended by all the Edoofians of 2023 and a few senior Edoofians from previous batches. It focused on the art of creation, innovation, and, most importantly, the mindset required to make an impact in one's career.
16/1/24, 1:53 PM - Kirti Edoofa: During this Industrial Visit and the conference - SLICE CON, Corporate leaders, such as the CEOs and Co-founders from renowned companies like Rage Coffee, Sirona Hygiene, Jolin New York, and more, shared their insights and experiences. These individuals are at the helm of multi-millionaire brands, leading large marketing teams. Their presence added immense value, providing students with the opportunity to engage in transformative conversations.
16/1/24, 1:53 PM - Kirti Edoofa: We believe that interactions with such industry leaders can bring significant transformations to students' lives, enhancing their business acumen. Our Edoofians maximized this opportunity, having life-changing conversations with these influential figures. The main objective of the event was to emphasize the importance of thinking outside the box, and encouraging students to believe in themselves and their dreams. Before we discuss your admission journey further, I wanted to share a glimpse of the event, and I hope you are excited to attend similar events when you come to India.

30/1/24, 11:23 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
30/1/24, 11:24 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: I believe Kibunda received the offer letter earlier, but you were not happy with the university I asked  for a better one  or a public university, Is that correct?
30/1/24, 11:29 AM - +260 96 9739802: Correct
30/1/24, 12:05 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: So shall I assist you with this concern?
30/1/24, 12:06 PM - +260 763112850: Yes please
30/1/24, 12:06 PM - +260 763112850: I the ranking of the university is not very good
30/1/24, 12:07 PM - +260 763112850: So we are kindly asking if you can provide a better one
30/1/24, 12:46 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Yes please, Surely I can assist you with the same
30/1/24, 12:47 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is BA (Economics) and your intake is in August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information is accurate?
30/1/24, 12:54 PM - +260 96 9739802: Correct
30/1/24, 1:08 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: As I have promised, the Edoofa Admissions team will be submitting your application to multiple universities that will evaluate your application and upon being eligible, you receive the offer letters with comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. *I will guide you to the best education institution/university associated with us that aligns with your vision and interest and would provide you with a conducive environment for your holistic development and to fulfil your career goals.*

Upon receiving the Offer Letter, you will have a few weeks to pay a portion of your university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. We discussed the registration fee during our counselling sessions. May I know, what do you recall about the same now?
30/1/24, 1:38 PM - +260 763112850: Go through the registration process again
30/1/24, 1:39 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Before that Kibunda, Can you please share with me your Grade-12 results?
30/1/24, 1:44 PM - +260 763112850: G12 180510060043 SOMPA SINZO KIBUNDA: ENG.-2, CVCEDU-2, R.E.-2, MATHS-1, BIOL-1, SCIE-1, F.N.-1, COMP-1 Result:SCHOOL CERTIFICATE
30/1/24, 1:44 PM - +260 763112850: These are my results
30/1/24, 1:44 PM - +260 763112850: For the final examination
30/1/24, 1:51 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Duly noted please!
30/1/24, 1:53 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Let me help you with a better understanding. *Usually, the registration fee is an additional fee apart from the cost of education but Edoofians receive an exclusive benefit where it is a part of the cost of education itself.* Let me give you an example:-
30/1/24, 1:53 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: As we discussed in the counselling session, the cost of education in India ranges from $6000-$8000 per annum which is reduced to $2000-$3000 per annum through the Edoofa Scholarship Program which includes the registration fee, remaining tuition fees, Accommodation, Food, Wifi, Laundry, library fee etc. Now, let us assume,

1. *Tuition Fee*: $1800 per annum
2. *Food and Accommodation Fee*: $1000 per annum 
Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum
3. *Registration Fee to be paid:* $1000
30/1/24, 1:53 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: This means this registration fee that you pay will be subtracted from the cost of education ($2800-$1000= $1800) and the remaining fee of $1800 can be paid in two installments. The first part of $900 within 3 days after your arrival here in India and the remaining $900 will be due in December 2024, or before your second semester begins.

*Do you have any questions for me regarding the same?*
30/1/24, 2:11 PM - +260 763112850: Noted 
No questions yet
30/1/24, 2:27 PM - +260 96 9739802: Greetings
