1/2/24, 11:22 AM - +260 97 7440395: No questions at this time
1/2/24, 12:22 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: As I have promised, the Edoofa Admissions team will be submitting your application to multiple universities that will evaluate your application and upon being eligible, you receive the offer letters with comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. *I will guide you to the best education institution/university associated with us that aligns with your vision and interest and would provide you with a conducive environment for your holistic development and to fulfil your career goals.*
1/2/24, 12:22 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Upon receiving the Offer Letter, you will have a few weeks to pay a portion of your university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. We discussed the registration fee during our counselling sessions. May I know, what do you recall about the same now?

1/2/24, 12:34 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Let me help you with a better understanding. *Usually, the registration fee is an additional fee apart from the cost of education but Edoofians receive an exclusive benefit where it is a part of the cost of education itself.* Let me give you an example:-
1/2/24, 12:35 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: As we discussed in the counseling session, the cost of education in India ranges from $6000-$8000 per annum which is reduced to $1200-$1800 per annum through the Edoofa Scholarship Program *as we recommended your application for a higher quantum of scholarship.* Congratulations on the same. Now, let us assume,
1/2/24, 12:35 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: 1. *Tuition Fee*: $650 per annum
2. *Accommodation Fee*: $0 per annum (100% Sponsorship)
3. *Remaining Fee Components*: [Library Fee, Examination Fee, EDB and Book Bank, International Student Development Fund, 24-Hour WiFi Cost, Maintenance Fee, Water Bill, and Electricity Bill]: $1000 per annum

*Total Fee: Tuition Fee $650 + Accommodation Fee $0 + Remaining Fee Components $1000 = $1650 per annum.*

4. *Registration Fee to be paid:* $1000 

This means this registration fee will be waived off from the cost of education ($1650-$1000= $650) and this remaining fee of $650 is supposed to be paid within 3 days of arrival.

*Do you have any questions for me regarding the same?*
1/2/24, 1:51 PM - +260 97 7440395: Thank you
1/2/24, 1:52 PM - +260 97 7440395: How much time will
1/2/24, 1:57 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: The registration fee can be paid either in two equal parts(The first half within 15 days and the second half within 30 days) or in one go itself.

3/2/24, 8:54 AM - +260 97 7440395: Good morning.. Thank you
3/2/24, 8:59 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: So before proceeding with the session, are there any questions you would like to ask?
3/2/24, 9:01 AM - +260 97 7440395: No questions just to thank you for arranging the call yesterday, it was insightful
3/2/24, 9:03 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: I hope you had a great discussion with the Edoofa Program Director yesterday?
3/2/24, 9:04 AM - +260 97 7440395: We did, thank you
3/2/24, 9:05 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: So what all did you manage to discuss during the sessions please?
3/2/24, 9:14 AM - +260 97 7440395: He comfirmed that Tukiya had been awarded a higher quantum schlorship and the total cost of her studies and everything else would be not more the 1600 dollars. Also that a payment of atleast 500 dollars needs to be made this month and another by march. And the balance by the time the semester starts. For now, we wait a few days to receive acceptance letters from the schools
3/2/24, 9:15 AM - +260 97 7440395: We also agreed to discuss the financials as a family and get back to you by Wednesday
3/2/24, 9:35 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Yes please you are partially correct, 
I believe he must have told you that the $500 should be paid by mid-February and the remaining $500 by before the month's end, i.e. 1st of March?
3/2/24, 9:40 AM - +260 97 7440395: Not quite, initially he said the 1000 could be paid by month end of March but later broke it down to 500 by end of February and 500 by end of March in order to facilitate for registration and other requirements
3/2/24, 9:40 AM - +260 97 7440395: Mid February would be too soon anyway
3/2/24, 9:42 AM - +260 97 7440395: How soon do you expect to hear from the universities with the acceptance letters?
3/2/24, 10:20 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Please the letter for the university will be shared with you ideally by the coming week itself Mrs Pupe
3/2/24, 10:24 AM - +260 97 7440395: So if I remember correctly, we will have 30 days from receipt of the letter for registration fee, correct?
3/2/24, 10:30 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Yes please that was the ideal case Mrs Pupe @260977440395 

*But since the number of higher quantum scholarship seats is limited in number*, do note that making a decision for your child towards the first semester's fees of $1000 will be necessary if you want her to enrol towards a good university, And also the program director would especially recommend Tukiya's application directly so you need not worry about the same and complete the formalities at the earliest. *Hence due to that fact we are asking you to expedite the process for our team to begin with the admission process for your son, that is why we expect you to adhere to the terms and timelines shared during your discussions earlier.* So that the entire admission formalities process ahead go hassle-free.
3/2/24, 10:53 AM - +260 97 7440395: Understood
3/2/24, 10:59 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: So are there any other questions you would like to ask?
3/2/24, 11:00 AM - +260 97 7440395: No questions
3/2/24, 11:01 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: This message was deleted
