16/1/24, 11:22 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Riyahboka,

I trust this message finds you well, and I hope you are in high spirits. In recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their A-Level results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey. <This message was edited>
16/1/24, 11:22 AM - Kirti Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?
16/1/24, 11:27 AM - +263 78 786 2520: I haven’t collected them at school but if i do so i will send
16/1/24, 11:35 AM - +263 78 786 2520: <Media omitted>

I hope you are doing well. Thank you for sharing your results, and congratulations on successfully clearing all your A-Level subjects! Your hard work over the past few months has truly paid off.

I am sure your family is immensely proud of your achievements. Your A-level results have been duly noted, and we will quickly add them to your scholarship application. This will enable us to engage in discussions with the academic board and chart the best course of action for your next steps.
17/1/24, 8:17 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Kindly allow us time till Monday to thoroughly evaluate your results and plan the way forward. Once we have re-evaluated your application, along with all the other applications, Mr. Shubham, the senior career counselor at Edoofa will connect with you to guide you on the next steps in your academic career.
17/1/24, 8:31 AM - +263 78 786 2520: Ok

Recalling our interaction after a frantic search for your name I ended up messaging you today.

22/1/24, 3:19 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: We were overwhelmed and had to reject more applications because of limited seats, however were surely intrigued to know the reasons for such an immediate upsurge.  Having Conversations with my other students who are already preparing to arrive in India under the Edoofa Scholarship shared some mind-boggling Screenshots from the Fee Prospectus of the Universities in Zimbabwe.

Have a good day ahead. 
God Bless You!
22/1/24, 9:15 PM - +263 78 786 2520: Same to you
23/1/24, 8:28 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Good Morning Everyone, 

*"The greatest glory in living lies not in never falling, but in rising every time we fall."*

*When you step into this day realize that you have immense opportunities! All you need to do is give your best to grab it.*

With all positive energy, I am here to continue our interactive session.
23/1/24, 8:38 AM - +263 78 786 2520: Thank you
23/1/24, 9:07 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: So let's continue from where we left off yesterday, 

I Would like to share, that I did further research on the university back in Zimbabwe, and I was shocked to compile these data for Fee Structures of some famous Public Universities of Zimbabwe.

*Bindura University of Science Education (BUSE)* -https://www.buse.ac.zw/fees-structure/ - *($680 per term)*

*Chinhoyi University of Technology (CUT)* https://www.cut.ac.zw/welcome/assets/files/fees-structure/School%20of%20Engineering%20Science.pdf - *($535 per term)*

*University of Zimbabwe (UZ)* -https://www.uz.ac.zw/index.php/faculties/160-fac-of-medicine/med-deparrtments/305-med-dpt-of-comm *($523 per term)*

NUST -*($870 per term)*

*I am sure you and your family must have also discussed this,*. So what have you decided for your future ahead?
23/1/24, 9:28 AM - +263 78 786 2520: Yes
23/1/24, 9:50 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: *I am sure you and your family must have also discussed this,*. So what have you decided for your future ahead?
23/1/24, 11:21 AM - +263 78 786 2520: Going to university
23/1/24, 12:32 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: That is absolutely understandable and thank you for sharing. Being a career counsellor, my aspirations for young learners like you are similar. I firmly believe higher education should combine the following for a learner to achieve their goals:-

Quality Education
Conducive Environment
Critical Thinking and Practical learning skills
Technological Literacy and Attachments
Cultural Awareness and Global Perspective
Career guidance, Mentorships, etc.


*However, not everyone achieves success. Do you know why*?
23/1/24, 1:55 PM - +263 78 786 2520: Why
23/1/24, 2:49 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
23/1/24, 2:53 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: I see you are quite a visionary and we will work together to make the right decision for your career. It is important to know why the Edoofa guidance will be unique compared to the normal University approach.
23/1/24, 2:54 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: *Personalized mentorship and guidance throughout your course:* As your Career Counsellor, I have known you since the beginning of the process, understanding your interests, aspirations, family background and plans for your career, unlike a University officer who may come across your application for the first time and treats with the same importance like others. I personally understand where you come from and what is required for you to be successful.
23/1/24, 2:54 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
23/1/24, 2:54 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: *Financial Support and Planning:* With a flexible payment plan for registration fees spreading across 45 days, the remaining cost of education can be paid in two installments. Students are ensured to open Indian bank accounts so that parents can even deposit the fees in monthly installments.
23/1/24, 2:54 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
23/1/24, 2:54 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: *Department of Student Welfare:* With a dedicated department to look after the Welfare of our Edoofians, our DSW officers operate directly from our university desks, being approachable to Edoofians for any assistance and motivating them to be on track with their careers. <This message was edited>
23/1/24, 2:55 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: These are just a few of the various benefits and keeping all this in mind, are you ready to step into your higher education through the Edoofa Program which is the most popular scholarship in Africa?
23/1/24, 7:29 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: I was expecting your response, but it seems you were occupied at that moment, so I will have to schedule your session for *tomorrow at 09:30 AM CAT* as my working hours are over for the day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.
23/1/24, 9:40 PM - +263 78 786 2520: Thank you
23/1/24, 9:40 PM - +263 78 786 2520: Yes
23/1/24, 9:46 PM - +263 78 786 2520: Ok
24/1/24, 8:04 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Good Morning Everyone, 

*“Education is the passport to the future, for tomorrow belongs to those who prepare for it today.” —Malcolm X"*

*When you step into this day realize that you have immense opportunities! All you need to do is give your best to grab it.*

With all positive energy, I am here to continue our interactive session.
24/1/24, 10:00 AM - +263 78 786 2520: Thank you
24/1/24, 10:28 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Perfect, To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is Bachelor of Business Administration and your intake is in August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information is accurate?
24/1/24, 11:02 AM - +263 78 786 2520: Yes
24/1/24, 12:13 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: As I have promised, the Edoofa Admissions team will be submitting your application to multiple universities that will evaluate your application and upon being eligible, you receive the offer letters with comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. *I will guide you to the best education institution/university associated with us that aligns with your vision and interest and would provide you with a conducive environment for your holistic development and to fulfil your career goals.*
24/1/24, 12:13 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Upon receiving the Offer Letter, you will have a few weeks to pay a portion of your university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. We discussed the registration fee during our counselling sessions. May I know, what do you recall about the same now?
24/1/24, 1:31 PM - +263 78 786 2520: You said that i can pay partly or fully
24/1/24, 2:23 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Yes please you are correct!
24/1/24, 2:23 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Let me help you with a better understanding. *Usually, the registration fee is an additional fee apart from the cost of education but Edoofians receive an exclusive benefit where it is a part of the cost of education itself.* Let me give you an example:-
24/1/24, 2:25 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: As we discussed in the counselling session, the cost of education in India ranges from $6000-$8000 per annum which is reduced to $2000-$3000 per annum through the Edoofa Scholarship Program which includes the registration fee, remaining tuition fees, Accommodation, Food, Wifi, Laundry, library fee etc. Now, let us assume,

1. *Tuition Fee*: $1800 per annum
2. *Food and Accommodation Fee*: $1000 per annum 
Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum
3. *Registration Fee to be paid:* $1000
24/1/24, 2:25 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: This means this registration fee that you pay will be subtracted from the cost of education ($2800-$1000= $1800) and the remaining fee of $1800 can be paid in two installments. The first part of $900 within 3 days after your arrival here in India and the remaining $900 will be due in December 2024, or before your second semester begins.

*Do you have any questions for me regarding the same?*
24/1/24, 2:55 PM - +263 78 786 2520: No
24/1/24, 3:16 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: The registration fee can be paid either in two equal parts(The first half within 15 days and the second half within 30 days) or in one go itself.

Are you clear with the details?
24/1/24, 3:47 PM - +263 78 786 2520: Yes
24/1/24, 3:53 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Dear  @263787862520 , I understand that you are interested in this golden opportunity to study in India under the given Scholarship. I do realize that your Family Members may have other concerns and this is the reason I have requested our Program Director Mr. Abhinav to spare some time to talk to your Parents about this. I hope you recall that he was the one to Interview you and had a Video Call with your Parents.
24/1/24, 3:55 PM - +263 78 786 2520: Yes
24/1/24, 3:56 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: May I know will your parents be available for the session tomorrow between 08:00 AM - 11:00 AM?
24/1/24, 3:57 PM - +263 78 786 2520: I will consult them <This message was edited>
24/1/24, 3:57 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Please, How long will the same take?

24/1/24, 5:14 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: So how long will it take for you to update me of the same?

5/2/24, 11:12 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: I have been trying to connect with you and your parents for the past few days and have gotten no response from them at all
I understand that they are occupied with work, But this is really surprising to me and to this scholarship opportunity itself, we have been trying to communicate with you for the past 7-8 days and there has been no response on your end even though you have read my messages.
5/2/24, 11:47 AM - +263 78 786 2520: I am working and its tight for me to use my phone and i am trying to raise the money for universities

5/2/24, 3:17 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Riyahboka, they are going through my messages but are not replying, can you explain the reason for the same?
5/2/24, 3:18 PM - +263 78 786 2520: Maybe its a mistake because my mother says she doesn’t read them

6/2/24, 8:44 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Good morning! let's draw inspiration from the timeless wisdom found in the Bible:

*Proverbs 1:5:*

*"Let the wise listen and add to their learning.' In the tapestry of progress, education is the thread that weaves nations together. As India seeks wisdom, let us prioritize education, creating a future where knowledge transcends boundaries and resonates more profoundly than ever. A commitment to learning is a commitment to a thriving, united nation."*

Let's continue our interactive session and embrace the transformative power of education
