I trust this message finds you well. With regards to our discussion in the day, I wanted to reach out to you and thank you for prioritizing and expediting the EWYL journey for Vimbai. We have already set up the dedicated group for Vimbai and are excited about the upcoming opportunities.

Having recently shared a glimpse of our annual Meet and Greet Seminar in Harare, we are eager to ensure that Vimbai is well-informed and ready to make the most of this transformative experience. Hence, please provide them with all the necessary details regarding the event tomorrow and guide them on how Vimbai can commence their EWYL journey seamlessly from this point onward.
