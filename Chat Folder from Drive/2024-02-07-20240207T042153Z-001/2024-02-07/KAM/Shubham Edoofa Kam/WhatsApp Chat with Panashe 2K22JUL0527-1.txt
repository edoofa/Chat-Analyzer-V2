16/1/24, 10:46 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Panashe,

I trust this message finds you well, and I hope you are in high spirits. In recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their A-Level results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey. <This message was edited>
16/1/24, 10:46 AM - Kirti Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further? <This message was edited>

31/1/24, 11:31 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: We were overwhelmed and had to reject more applications because of limited seats, however were surely intrigued to know the reasons for such an immediate upsurge.  Having Conversations with my other students who are already preparing to arrive in India under the Edoofa Scholarship shared some mind-boggling Screenshots from the Fee Prospectus of the Universities in Zimbabwe.
31/1/24, 11:31 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: I am shocked to compile these data for Fee Structures of some famous Public Universities of Zimbabwe.

*Bindura University of Science Education (BUSE)* -https://www.buse.ac.zw/fees-structure/ - *($680 per term)*

*Chinhoyi University of Technology (CUT)* https://www.cut.ac.zw/welcome/assets/files/fees-structure/School%20of%20Engineering%20Science.pdf - *($535 per term)*

*University of Zimbabwe (UZ)* -https://www.uz.ac.zw/index.php/faculties/160-fac-of-medicine/med-deparrtments/305-med-dpt-of-comm *($523 per term)*

NUST -*($870 per term)*
31/1/24, 11:31 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: *I am sure you and your family must have also discussed this,*. So what have you decided for your future ahead?
31/1/24, 11:34 AM - +263 78 773 1317: Noted
31/1/24, 11:35 AM - +263 78 773 1317: We have discussed about me having higher quality education abroad because we have seen that there are more advantages for one to study there
31/1/24, 12:34 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Being a senior academician and counsellor, my aspirations for young learners like you are similar. I firmly believe higher education should combine the following for a learner to achieve their goals:-

Quality Education
Conducive Environment
Critical Thinking and Practical learning skills
Technological Literacy and Attachments
Cultural Awareness and Global Perspective
Career guidance, Mentorships, etc.

*However, not everyone achieves success. Do you know why*?

31/1/24, 2:18 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: *1. Personalized mentorship and guidance throughout your course:* As your Career Counsellor, I have known you since the beginning of the process, understanding your interests, aspirations, family background and plans for your career, unlike a University officer who may come across your application for the first time and treats with the same importance like others. I personally understand where you come from and what is required for you to be successful.
31/1/24, 2:19 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: *2. The Earn While You Learn Program:*  Even though the EWYL program was affected by lessons and exams in Zimbabwe, you will have access to a streamlined process here in India with better earning projects, regular visits by mentors, seminars and training programs which even opens self-financing opportunities. Students have even catered their entire costs through their EWYL earnings.
31/1/24, 2:19 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
31/1/24, 2:19 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: *3. Financial Support and Planning:* With a flexible payment plan for registration fees spreading across 45 days, the remaining cost of education can be paid in two installments. Students are ensured to open Indian bank accounts so that parents can even deposit the fees in monthly installments.

3/2/24, 9:43 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: So before proceeding with the session, are there any questions you would like to ask?
3/2/24, 12:23 PM - +263 78 773 1317: No questions yet
3/2/24, 12:25 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: @263787731317 I have been noticing that for the past few sessions you have been inactive for your sessions, can you help me understand the reason for the same?
3/2/24, 12:27 PM - +263 78 773 1317: Sorry for that sir, some other time network connection will be not working properly so this will lead to my absence
3/2/24, 12:28 PM - +263 78 773 1317: I am at my grandfather's farm so network there is a problem. They just have local calls but international communication is not easy there
3/2/24, 12:29 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: So don't you think that you could have notified me about the same so that I could have scheduled these sessions accordingly?
3/2/24, 12:31 PM - +263 78 773 1317: I am so sorry for that.
3/2/24, 12:47 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Please from the next time do notify me once if you have certain activities to attend to so that I can schedule your session accordingly.
3/2/24, 12:48 PM - +263 78 773 1317: Very well thank you
3/2/24, 12:49 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Now please share, which course do you wish to pursue for your higher education?
3/2/24, 12:50 PM - +263 78 773 1317: I wanted to specialise on Airlines and Airport Management
3/2/24, 12:51 PM - +263 78 773 1317: But in that way we are still discussing it with my parents, some they are saying the one I chose before is good
3/2/24, 12:51 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: And why do you wish to change your course specifically in this field of study?
3/2/24, 12:54 PM - +263 78 773 1317: I wanted a course which is so broad that I can be able to full fill my dreams
3/2/24, 12:57 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: I totally understand the issue you are facing, Panashe,
3/2/24, 1:01 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Please both Agriculture and Tavel and Tourism are reputable courses, But I can understand where your parents are coming from, Since Zimbabwe has a high yield towards Agriculture and the economy also depends upon the same factor, hence this becomes a safe choice as the job opportunities in this field will be easier for you to get. So if you ask me I would suggest you to stick with the same course *B.Sc in Agriculture* and take that extra risk of taking your parent's words into consideration
3/2/24, 1:03 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: If you plan to pivot towards a coruse related to the field of arts then I would suggest you *Bachelor of Arts - Bachelor of Legislative Law,* as you will be eligible for higher quantum of scholarship with this course as well!
3/2/24, 1:51 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: As it's the weekend, *Now we will connect for our session on Monday at 09:00 AM. Please be online during your session.*
