16/1/24, 11:09 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Vongai,

I trust this message finds you well, and I hope you are in high spirits. In recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their A-Level results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey.
16/1/24, 11:09 AM - Kirti Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?
17/1/24, 10:22 AM - +27 73 679 6781: We are good how a you. We are happy about results but finance problem now.
17/1/24, 12:02 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for asking, I am doing great. I completely understand, however, for us to help you here with your concern we would require your result so that we can go through the result and offer the best opportunity possible for Vongai.

17/1/24, 1:04 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your results, and congratulations on successfully clearing all your A-Level subjects! Your hard work over the past few months has truly paid off.

I am sure your family is immensely proud of your achievements. Your A-level results have been duly noted, and we will quickly add them to your scholarship application. This will enable us to engage in discussions with the academic board and chart the best course of action for your next steps.
17/1/24, 1:04 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Kindly allow us time till Monday to thoroughly evaluate your results and plan the way forward. Once we have re-evaluated your application, along with all the other applications, Mr. Shubham, the senior career counselor at Edoofa will connect with you to guide you on the next steps in your academic career.
17/1/24, 1:09 PM - +27 73 679 6781: Ok

I received results from all my students, happy and exhilarating with joy. Recalling our interaction, I remembered that during our session you portrayed an enormous potential of becoming a leader of tomorrow. Hence I have asked my Colleague *Mr Shubham, Senior Academician* to personally look after your admission process so that we can proceed with your application on priority. 

Hence I request you to come online and continue with your admission procedures.

Career guidance, Mentorships, etc.

*However, not everyone achieves success. Do you know why*?

Personalized mentorship and guidance throughout your course:* As your Career Counsellor, I have known you since the beginning of the process, understanding your interests, aspirations, family background and plans for your career, unlike a University officer who may come across your application for the first time and treats with the same importance like others.

31/1/24, 1:19 PM - +263 73 836 0751: Yes

1/2/24, 9:42 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Good Morning Everyone, 

*“Education is the best friend. An educated person is respected everywhere. Education beats the beauty and the youth.”*

With all positive energy, I am here to continue our interactive session.
1/2/24, 10:59 AM - +27 73 679 6781: Yes lets continue.
1/2/24, 12:12 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Let me help you with a better understanding. *Usually, the registration fee is an additional fee apart from the cost of education but Edoofians receive an exclusive benefit where it is a part of the cost of education itself.* Let me give you an example:-
1/2/24, 12:13 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: As we discussed in the counseling session, the cost of education in India ranges from $6000-$8000 per annum which is reduced to $1200-$1800 per annum through the Edoofa Scholarship Program *as we recommended your application for a higher quantum of scholarship.* Congratulations on the same. Now, let us assume,
1/2/24, 12:13 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: 1. *Tuition Fee*: $650 per annum
2. *Accommodation Fee*: $0 per annum (100% Sponsorship)
3. *Remaining Fee Components*: [Library Fee, Examination Fee, EDB and Book Bank, International Student Development Fund, 24-Hour WiFi Cost, Maintenance Fee, Water Bill, and Electricity Bill]: $1000 per annum

*Total Fee: Tuition Fee $650 + Accommodation Fee $0 + Remaining Fee Components $1000 = $1650 per annum.*

4. *Registration Fee to be paid:* $1000
1/2/24, 12:13 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: This means this registration fee will be waived off from the cost of education ($1650-$1000= $650) and this remaining fee of $650 is supposed to be paid within 3 days of arrival.

*Do you have any questions for me regarding the same?*
1/2/24, 12:56 PM - +27 73 679 6781: I dont have questions about this.
1/2/24, 1:39 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: The registration fee can be paid either in two equal parts(The first half within 15 days and the second half within 30 days) or in one go itself.

Are you clear with the details?
1/2/24, 4:13 PM - +27 73 679 6781: Yes
1/2/24, 4:13 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: I understand that you are interested in this golden opportunity to study in India under the given Scholarship. I do realize that your Family Members may have other concerns and this is the reason I have requested our Program Director Mr. Abhinav to spare some time to talk to your Parents about this. I hope you recall that he was the one to Interview you and had a Video Call earlier.

5/2/24, 12:05 PM - +27 73 679 6781: Yes
5/2/24, 12:07 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Hello Mr Mutangi
I hope you had a great conversation with the Edoofa Program director Mr Abhinav, following the same we discussed your case with the Academic board and came to the conclusion that we would be referring your child's application for a higher quantum scholarship of 80-90%, Compared to the last time which was of 50%. This higher quantum would be for the course *Bachelor of Arts - Bachelor of Legislative Law* which is a more reputable course globally and in Zimbabwe hence it was recommended to you by the director for your child's better career trajectory, Since Vongai's university application is still not finalized yet, hence the program director would be personally looking over the procedures so that his process go hassle-free.
5/2/24, 12:07 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: I was also told by the program director that after hardships you have managed to raise 21000 SA rands for your child's fees, Which is equivalent to $1100. but the issue you are facing is that you are not satisfied with your current job and that is making you have second thoughts and doubts that you will be able to pay the fees for the first year but what if you change jobs and are not able to afford the fees later on. *I understand the financial commitment and hardships it takes for a parent to educate their child. But because of that, you cannot neglect the importance of quality education. Knowing the situation back there in Africa, the majority of students after completing their bachelor's degree have no guarantee of employment security.*
5/2/24, 12:07 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: For deserving students like Vongai we have formulated various Earn While You Learn Projects so that if they work hard in them along with their academics at the university they are easily able to earn around $200-$300 per month, By this way Vongai will be able to majorly self finance her education and help you in reducing your financial burden, *Will that not be helpful to you?*
5/2/24, 4:21 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: I have noted all your responses for the day, Since my working hours for the day are over now, *I have therefore scheduled your session for 09:30 AM CAT tomorrow*

God Bless you,
Have a great day ahead!

*In the meantime please go through the video shared below to understand how our program helps the students in getting great infrastructure and facilities from here in India*

6/2/24, 8:44 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Good morning! let's draw inspiration from the timeless wisdom found in the Bible:

*Proverbs 1:5:*

*"Let the wise listen and add to their learning.' In the tapestry of progress, education is the thread that weaves nations together. As India seeks wisdom, let us prioritize education, creating a future where knowledge transcends boundaries and resonates more profoundly than ever. A commitment to learning is a commitment to a thriving, united nation."*
