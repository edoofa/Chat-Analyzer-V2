6/2/24, 7:57 PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Afternoon, @Sanjana,

I trust this message finds you well. With regard to our discussion in the day, I wanted to reach out to you and thank you for prioritizing and expediting the EWYL journey for Paul. We have already set up the dedicated group for Paul and are excited about the upcoming opportunities.

Having recently shared a glimpse of our annual Meet and Greet Seminar in Harare, we are eager to ensure that Paul is well-informed and ready to make the most of this transformative experience. Hence, please provide them with all the necessary details regarding the event tomorrow and guide them on how Paul can commence their EWYL journey seamlessly from this point onward.
6/2/24, 7:57 PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Afternoon Paul,

I hope this message finds you well and filled with the same excitement that's buzzing here at Edoofa! It's that time of the year again when we eagerly anticipate our annual Meet and Greet Seminar in Harare. This event holds a special place in our hearts as it brings us closer to our community, and we're counting down the days with great anticipation!
6/2/24, 7:57 PM - Dev Edoofa: Just like clockwork, we're gearing up for the seminar next week, and I couldn't resist sharing our enthusiasm with you. Your presence would truly make the event all the more meaningful, guiding you on your journey to India. Hence, with immense joy, we wanted to extend the special invitation for the Meet and Greet Seminar to you and your wonderful family.
6/2/24, 7:57 PM - Dev Edoofa: And in the process of doing the same, I happened to notice that you haven't started your EWYL Program by now. In light of this, I had a discussion with Ms. Sanjana, the head of the EWYL Department, and I am happy to share that she has graciously agreed to make a special exception for you, expediting your application process.
6/2/24, 7:58 PM - Dev Edoofa: As a result, I have gone ahead and created your very own dedicated EWYL Group - *Paul EWYL23E1193*, adding both you and your parents to the mix. If I have missed including any other family members, they can easily join using the following link: https://chat.whatsapp.com/Bb7TM3dCljhCti6LLLVoxy

Within the group, the EWYL team will not only guide you on the hows and whens of the EWYL Program but also share all the exciting details about the upcoming Meet and Greet Seminar in Harare. We are genuinely thrilled to witness you embark on this transformative journey, and we are rooting for your success every step of the way!

Warmest regards,
Admissions Team.
