6/1/24, 10:28 AM - Dev Edoofa: Moving forward in our today’s session, we will discuss a bit about your university admission journey. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts. I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them.

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
6/1/24, 10:33 AM - +263 77 377 5772: Sure , we can start now .
6/1/24, 10:43 AM - Dev Edoofa: <Media omitted>
6/1/24, 11:10 AM - +263 77 377 5772: I have gone through the image sir.
6/1/24, 11:23 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
6/1/24, 11:23 AM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
6/1/24, 11:40 AM - +263 77 377 5772: Yes, they are very well understood and clear sir.
6/1/24, 11:53 AM - Dev Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
6/1/24, 11:53 AM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
6/1/24, 12:01 PM - +263 77 377 5772: Yes lm following.
6/1/24, 12:06 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process, the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
6/1/24, 12:06 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
6/1/24, 12:08 PM - +263 77 377 5772: All clear Mr. Dev
6/1/24, 12:10 PM - +263 77 377 5772: So the registration fee is to be paid before going to lndia.
6/1/24, 12:17 PM - Dev Edoofa: Yes @263773775772, the registration fees is paid while the student is still in the home country. Once we move forward with the further process, you will soon get to know how and when this fees is to be paid.
6/1/24, 12:18 PM - +263 77 377 5772: Noted sir
6/1/24, 12:54 PM - Dev Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
6/1/24, 1:33 PM - +263 71 745 9650: Yes sure.
8/1/24, 9:03 PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Ashley!
I hope all of you are doing great. While I was wrapping up my day, I observed that we were not able to have a smooth discussion for the past couple of days, which has led to some delay in the admission process. We are aware of your immense trust in us and we surely care about your future. Considering that in mind, I wanted to schedule a specific session tomorrow at 8:30 am so that we can cover the process we are lagging behind,  and ensure that your admission process is on track. Hence, I wanted to understand if you will be available for our session at 8:30am. If not, I would like you to please let me know at what time between 8:30 am to 4 pm will you be available?
8/1/24, 9:09 PM - +263 71 745 9650: I will be available at 8.30 am
8/1/24, 9:09 PM - +263 71 745 9650: Greetings to you
9/1/24, 8:51 AM - Dev Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Ashley!
I hope all of you are having a wonderful morning. I extremely excited to take forward your admission process today and I trust that you are as well. Let's start with our session.
9/1/24, 3:39 PM - +263 77 377 5772: How are doing.We are doing great as well
9/1/24, 4:24 PM - +263 71 745 9650: Good afternoon sir , my apologies for not responding to the messages , today was the opening of schools and l was occupied with some school stuff
9/1/24, 4:25 PM - +263 71 745 9650: I'm very sorry sir. Tomorrow l will surely be available.
9/1/24, 8:18 PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Ashley.

I hope all of you are having a wonderful day. Today I had a meeting with the academic board and I was discussing the current status of your application file and in the same discussion, the team higjlighted that we have been a bit off track for the discusisons we were suppsed to completed and hence I wanted to reach out to you and just reiteratre the agenda of the sessions/discusisons we have in place.
9/1/24, 8:19 PM - Dev Edoofa: The agenda for these sessions is to help you understand the process Ashley will undertake for his university admission journey and what your family will be experiencing with the Edoofa Scholarship Program over the next one and a half years. However, since Ashley is in school and you are occupied with work during the day, it seems that the same challenge in connectivity is going to persist for the next couple of months as well.
9/1/24, 8:19 PM - Dev Edoofa: If you see, our goal is to help you prepare for your child's education abroad, that is something that is going to require a significant time. It requires months of planning. Hence, to do that perfectly and be prepared, as a parent, you would have to contribute an hour daily for at least 10 days so that we can be in sync and make the right decisions.
9/1/24, 8:19 PM - Dev Edoofa: We, at Edoofa, are determined to provide affordable higher education to hardworking students and assist them in launching their careers to greater heights. We will be able to help you only if we can connect timely and have healthy discussions.
9/1/24, 8:21 PM - Dev Edoofa: With that being said, what I can do right now to solve this constraint is give you the freedom to choose the time slot for our sessions over the next 10 days [till 20th January]. This way, we can align it with our availability as well and help you move forward and make progress in a streamlined manner. Could you please let me know at what time you would be available from Monday to Friday between 08:00 AM and 06:00 PM? This would help us factor in your inputs and find the right time for our sessions.
9/1/24, 9:20 PM - +263 71 745 9650: 09:00 AM is the best
9/1/24, 9:27 PM - +263 77 377 5772: Good evening team,we are very sorry sure for not being able to coorperate very well due to network problem and also time alocation
10/1/24, 9:17 AM - +263 71 745 9650: Good morning to you all.
How are you doing today ?
12/1/24, 11:14 AM - +263 71 745 9650: Greetings to you all.
12/1/24, 1:33 PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Ashley!
I hope all of you are doing well. I have taken note of the above timings that were shared by you. I would like you to kindly provide me with some time to look into my schedule and provide you with confirmation regarding this. I hope you understand!
12/1/24, 1:33 PM - Dev Edoofa: Till then, with great excitement and pride, I want to share that over the past few days, the Edoofa team has been immersed in an exciting event we had in store for our students. Edoofa hosted a conference - the Symposium of Leaders, Innovators, and Creators at Edoofa, also known as 'SLICE-CON.'

The conference was attended by all the Edoofians of 2023 and a few senior Edoofians from previous batches. It focused on the art of creation, innovation, and, most importantly, the mindset required to make an impact in one's career.
12/1/24, 1:33 PM - Dev Edoofa: During this Industrial Visit and the conference - SLICE CON, Corporate leaders, such as the CEOs and Co-founders from renowned companies like Rage Coffee, Sirona Hygiene, Jolin New York, and more, shared their insights and experience. These individuals are at the helm of multi-millionaire brands, leading large marketing teams. Their presence added immense value, providing students with the opportunity to engage in transformative conversations.
12/1/24, 1:34 PM - Dev Edoofa: We believe that interactions with such industry leaders can bring significant transformations to students' lives, enhancing their business acumen. Our Edoofians maximized this opportunity, having life-changing conversations with these influential figures. The main objective of the event was to emphasize the importance of thinking outside the box, encouraging students to believe in themselves and their dreams. Before we start our session today, I wanted to share a glimpse of the event, and I hope you are excited to attend similar events when you come to India.

19/1/24, 10:56 AM - Dev Edoofa: Good Morning Ashley!
I am doing well and I hope the same for you as well.
19/1/24, 10:56 AM - +263 71 745 9650: I'm perfectly fine sir .
19/1/24, 10:57 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that!

19/1/24, 11:33 AM - +263 71 745 9650: 2). What is the relationship between entrepreneurship and economic development?

Answering the second question , the relationship between entrepreneurship and economic development is complicated and can vary from one country to another based on their level of economic growth . 
In highly developed economies , entrepreneurs can accelerate growth , while in less- developed ones they may have less of a positive effect. Entrepreneurship and economic growth go hand in hand , with innovation acting as a catalyst for growth .
According to my own thinking , there is a strong relationship between entrepreneurship and economic development. Entrepreneurship can drive economic development by creating jobs, boosting productivity, and introducing new technologies and innovations to the market. In addition, entrepreneurs can play a role in solving economic problems by finding creative solutions to issues like poverty, unemployment, and access to basic services. They can also help foster growth in new industries and stimulate demand for goods and services. 
To facilitate innovation driven entrepreneurship, government and institutions play a crucial role by fostering an environment that supports sustained economic development.
19/1/24, 11:36 AM - +263 71 745 9650: 3). Please share your understanding of GAAP and it's importance ?

GAAP ( Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ) are the guidelines by which most finance professionals record and report financial performance In a company . GAAP is important because it helps to ensure that financial statements are consistent, accurate, and reliable. This allows businesses to make informed decisions, and it also allows investors and other stakeholders to make informed decisions about a company. GAAP also helps to promote transparency and fairness in the financial reporting process. GAAP also helps to prevent misrepresentation in financial reporting. It  also promotes efficient capital markets, as investors can rely on the accuracy of financial statements when making investment decisions. 
While GAAP is not regulated by Government, it was created through a collaboration between business and government. It isn't mandatory for all businesses , but is highly recommend, especially if one plans to eventually go public or if you expect to be raising capital or preparing for another transaction in the near future . 
Finally , GAAP promotes consistency , as it allows for apples -to- apples comparisons of financial statements from different companies.
19/1/24, 11:37 AM - +263 71 745 9650: 4). What are accounting standards and why are they mandatory? 

Accounting standards are a set of rules and guidelines that govern how financial information is recorded and reported. Accounting standards are developed by professional organizations, such as the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) in the United States. These standards are mandatory because they help to ensure that financial reporting is consistent and reliable. Without accounting standards, companies could potentially report their financial information in a way that is misleading or even fraudulent.
Accounting standards are the primary source of generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) .
Mandatory standards help to ensure that companies follow best practices when it comes to financial reporting. They help to protect the interests of stakeholders, including investors and creditors. Mandatory standards help to promote transparency and accountability within the financial system. They specify how transactions and other events are to be recognized, measured , presented and disclosed in financial statements. 
It is mandatory for companies to follow accounting standards as it ensures uniformity in the accounting process and also make statements comparable with other organizations.  Finally, they help to level the playing field for companies, so that everyone is playing by the same rules.
19/1/24, 11:37 AM - +263 71 745 9650: 5). Please differentiate between accounting and auditing ?

Accounting and auditing are two closely related but distinct fields. accounting involves the recording, classifying, and summarizing of financial transactions, while auditing involves the examination and evaluation of the accuracy of financial statements. In other words, accounting focuses on the collection and preparation of financial information, while auditing focuses on the review and verification of that information. 
One major difference is in the objectives of each field. The objective of accounting is to provide useful financial information to decision makers, while the objective of auditing is to provide an independent opinion on the fairness of the financial statements. Another difference is in the parties that each field serves. Accounting serves internal parties, such as management, while auditing serves external parties, such as investors and creditors.
In simple terms accounting is the continuous process of managing and maintaining financial records . Whereas auditing is a periodic process that validates the accuracy of financial statements .
19/1/24, 3:01 PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Ashley!
I hope you are doing well. Thank you for providing the responses to the documents, I have taken note of these and will update them in our records. We have our session right now. May I know if you are ready to take forward our conversation?
19/1/24, 3:10 PM - +263 71 745 9650: Yes, absolutely.
19/1/24, 3:14 PM - Dev Edoofa: That is good to know! With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey. we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*.
19/1/24, 3:16 PM - Dev Edoofa: However, before we do the same, I was going through your scholarship application file and noticed that you are supposed to make the payment of your remaining part of Edoofa Enrollment fee. Hence, I thought of sharing a gentle reminder with you and trying to understand how your preparation has been so far? Have you been able to align your preparations in the right direction?
19/1/24, 3:19 PM - +263 71 745 9650: All in progress and l will pay next week
19/1/24, 3:23 PM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. I have taken note of it and have updated the accounts team as well.
19/1/24, 3:23 PM - Dev Edoofa: In the meantime. Let us move forward with our discussion. To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is BCom and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2025. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
19/1/24, 3:28 PM - +263 71 745 9650: Absolutely correct
19/1/24, 3:31 PM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. Based on our experience of over 14 years and having assisted over 5000 students from different countries, we have realized that financial planning is the most important factor when a student plans for his/her higher education abroad.
19/1/24, 3:31 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am sure that you must be aware that 20-30% of students who are admitted into universities abroad are unable to fulfill their dream and come to India due to a lack of financial planning. The funds needed for booking flights, accommodation, and covering living expenses after arrival often become overwhelming, leading to the decision to defer their admission for a year. This, in turn, creates a gap in the child's education.
19/1/24, 3:31 PM - Dev Edoofa: To assist both students and parents in this regard, Edoofa Management has designed a Financial Secure Plan that aims to help you prepare for your higher educational finances without experiencing stress or last-minute rushes. I believe you must be wondering about the details of the same plan and how it helps the parents?
19/1/24, 3:35 PM - +263 71 745 9650: Yes sure .
19/1/24, 3:37 PM - Dev Edoofa: Edoofa Secure Plan is important for parents who have children joining the university for tertiary education in the next one to two years for several reasons:

*Financial Preparedness:* The Edoofa Secure plan helps parents prepare financially for the costs after the Scholarship being offered so that they are not caught off guard.

*Reduced Financial Stress:* Having the Edoofa Secure Plan in place can significantly reduce the financial stress on you as parents when your child is about to enter university. Knowing that there is a dedicated fund for education expenses provides peace of mind.
19/1/24, 3:37 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Avoiding Debt*: Without proper savings, some parents may resort to taking out loans or accumulating credit card debt to cover their child's education costs. This Educational savings plan helps avoid the burden of debt and high-interest payments.

*Compound Interest:* By starting to save early and consistently contributing to the savings plan, parents can take advantage of compound interest, which can significantly increase the amount available for education expenses.
19/1/24, 3:37 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Flexibility and Control:* The Edoofa Secure savings plans allow parents to have greater control over their finances and how they allocate funds for their child's education. They can choose investment options that align with their risk tolerance and financial goals.

*Encouraging Responsibility*: Involving your child in the process of saving for their education teaches them financial responsibility and the value of higher education. It also motivates them to outperform in Academics.
19/1/24, 3:37 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Adapting to Unexpected Changes*: Life is full of surprises, and circumstances can change especially when there are political reforms changing each day impacting the Local Currency. Having an Edoofa Secure Plan allows parents to adapt to unexpected changes in their financial situation while still prioritizing their child's education.

*Peace of Mind:* Overall, having the Edoofa Secure plan provides parents with peace of mind, knowing that they are actively planning for their child's future and increasing the likelihood of providing them with a solid education.
19/1/24, 3:38 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, when you go through all the above benefits, I am sure you can see that the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan is an important financial tool for parents/students who are supposed to enter the university soon. 

It helps ensure that the financial aspect of tertiary education is well-managed, reduces stress, and allows parents to provide the best opportunities for their children without resorting to debt or financial hardship. Isn't this something you and your family also wish to have?
19/1/24, 3:48 PM - +263 71 745 9650: Also wish for the same
19/1/24, 3:48 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through the above points, do you want me to help you understand how the Edoofa Secure Plan works?
19/1/24, 3:49 PM - +263 71 745 9650: Yes sure please
19/1/24, 3:49 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, as you are aware, we are currently in January 2024, and we have a good 20-21 months to plan for your finances before you start your university education in 2025.
19/1/24, 3:49 PM - Dev Edoofa: During the counseling session, you were informed that at Edoofa, we guarantee a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship on the tuition fees. Hence, the cost of education, including food and accommodation after the scholarship, would be between $2000-$3000, and it could be even less. Not more than that.
19/1/24, 3:49 PM - Dev Edoofa: This means that if you can save $150 per month for the next 20 months, you will be able to save $3000. This amount is more than enough for the first year of university fees, including tuition fees (if any), food, and accommodation. I hope you agree with this?
19/1/24, 3:51 PM - +263 71 745 9650: Strongly agree
19/1/24, 3:52 PM - Dev Edoofa: Right, this means that by the time you would be in India, you would have already saved the $3000 that will cover the first-year fee.
19/1/24, 3:52 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, in these next 20 months, I am sure you would also be engaged in the EWYL program, and if you secure a minimum of $1000 in 20 months, that means the fees for 1.5 years are already secured.
19/1/24, 3:52 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, for a 3-year course, if we follow the same approach for the remaining 1.5 years, the educational journey for the student and the financial journey for the parent will be easy and smooth. I believe you must be able to see this perspective?
19/1/24, 3:54 PM - +263 71 745 9650: Strongly believe the same sir
19/1/24, 3:55 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. With that said, there is also another benefit, I am sure being in Zimbabwe you know how drastically the exchange rate fluctuates.
19/1/24, 3:55 PM - Dev Edoofa: If you are buying a dollar today, you might be spending 7000 bonds, but if you buy a dollar after a month, the rate would be different.
19/1/24, 3:56 PM - Dev Edoofa: Also, even if you choose to buy dollars every month and save at your home, it is not safe since there is news of robbery, and mugging every day.
19/1/24, 3:56 PM - Dev Edoofa: In that case, you will opt to save in the Bank, but again we know that savings in the Bank require a Nostro Account which means you have to pay the bank to keep your money safe, right?
19/1/24, 3:56 PM - +263 71 745 9650: Correct
19/1/24, 3:59 PM - Dev Edoofa: That is great to hear, considering these constraints, Edoofa Management has decided to help the parents and students prepare for the journey way ahead of time by helping them save money with Edoofa without any additional charges but rather saving additional money as well. Do you want me to explain how this has been achieved?
19/1/24, 4:02 PM - +263 71 745 9650: Please do sir
19/1/24, 4:41 PM - +263 71 745 9650: Hello Admission officer, I am now in touch with my EWYL Mentor. The name of my Mentor is Ms. Aditi and she has scheduled my session for Monday .
19/1/24, 5:00 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Program Fee (Enrollment Fee) that you were asked to pay is $350. From the $350, you have already paid $200, and the remaining $150 is what you are planning to pay by tomorrow before your due date.
19/1/24, 5:00 PM - Dev Edoofa: Under the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan, a parent has to deposit a small amount of money which is $150 every month for the next 10 months. 

That means, in 10 months, the money saved will be $1500. When this money is saved, Edoofa will waive off the remaining $150 which was due from the Edoofa Program/Enrollment Fee of $350, thereby making a straight saving of $150 in 10 months.
19/1/24, 5:00 PM - Dev Edoofa: Imagine you paying $15 every month to the Bank of Zimbabwe to keep your money safe, and here Edoofa is paying you $15 every month to keep your money safe. Now, you must be wondering, why only for 10 months and not for 20 months, right?
19/1/24, 6:37 PM - +263 71 745 9650: Yes sure lm also wondering the same
20/1/24, 12:32 PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Ashley! 
I hope you are doing well. Since you replied when our operational hours were over. May I know if you are ready for our session right now to discuss the Edoofa Secure Plan?
20/1/24, 12:40 PM - +263 71 745 9650: Good afternoon to you too.
20/1/24, 12:40 PM - +263 71 745 9650: Yes, I'm ready.
20/1/24, 1:09 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that! In our last discussion, we discussed the Edoofa financial Secure plan. Let's move ahead!
20/1/24, 1:09 PM - +263 71 745 9650: Okay , sure.
20/1/24, 1:10 PM - Dev Edoofa: If you see the bigger picture, you will realize that the reason is quite simple. Upon the completion of the 10 installments, the Edoofa Admissions team will initiate the Child’s Admission Process by applying early to the universities to secure their scholarship and their university seat.
20/1/24, 1:10 PM - Dev Edoofa: Reserving seats earlier increases the chances of obtaining a maximum scholarship. A higher scholarship means lower fees, and by securing the seat, you will be entitled to pay the fees as per the old fee structure of the university, not the new one implemented in January 2025. Furthermore, when applying to the universities, you will receive an offer letter or a letter of intent detailing the fees, scholarship, and registration fee.
20/1/24, 1:10 PM - Dev Edoofa: As explained during the enrollment process, the registration fee is a portion of your first-year university fee, paid to reserve the seat. It ranges from $500-$1000 and is not an additional fee. 

From the $1500 you saved with Edoofa, the registration fee will be paid to the university, securing the seat. For instance, if the registration fee is $1000, Edoofa will pay $1000 from the $1500 saved in 10 months. The updated balance with Edoofa will be $500, which will be paid to the university upon your arrival in India.
20/1/24, 1:10 PM - Dev Edoofa: This eases the financial burden on the parent, as there is no immediate payment required upon the student's arrival. The $500 saved will cover the remaining fees for the semester/year, as specified in the offer letter from the university. What are your thoughts on this?
20/1/24, 1:29 PM - +263 77 377 5772: I take it as a goog idea.
20/1/24, 1:38 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to see that we are together so far. With this plan for the next 10 months, I am sure you must be wondering what will happen in the next 10 months, considering you have already secured your scholarship seat with the university due to your hard work in the first 10 months. Is my understanding correct?
20/1/24, 1:39 PM - +263 77 377 5772: Of course yes
20/1/24, 1:42 PM - Dev Edoofa: Let me help you with that as well. In the 11th month, you will be guided to open an FBC Mastercard bank account in Zimbabwe with a deposit of $150. The reason for this is that when you apply for your student Visa, the Embassy asks for a Bank Statement, and this account will serve that purpose.
20/1/24, 1:42 PM - Dev Edoofa: We understand it might be expensive if you deposit another $1500 for the remaining 10 months in FB  Bank Zimbabwe, so to avoid the same challenges, we have designed the plan accordingly. You will only be depositing for the 11th, 12th, 13th, and 14th month, which is 4 months.
20/1/24, 1:42 PM - Dev Edoofa: Once the 4 months are completed, our Department of Student Welfare (DSW) team will assist you with your visa process. The bank statement will act as one of the required documents, and once you receive the visa, you can withdraw the amount from FBC and book the flight ticket. This will help you utilize the money as well. How does it sound?
20/1/24, 1:55 PM - +263 71 745 9650: Wonderful sir
20/1/24, 1:55 PM - +263 77 377 5772: Very well undetstood Sir
20/1/24, 1:56 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am delighted to hear that! Now, from the 16th Month till the 20th month, considering it is a 6-month window, you can again continue depositing the money ($150) with Edoofa which can be used in the fee as and when required or you can decide to save this $900 of these 6 months with you as well. This is something which you are free to choose. I hope you understand the financial secure plan now?
20/1/24, 2:15 PM - +263 77 377 5772: I understand it Sir
20/1/24, 2:16 PM - Dev Edoofa: That's great. Now that you have all the information, I want you to take some time and discuss the financial security plan with your family members. Help them understand its importance and details. Once you're done, we can reconnect, have a discussion, and address any queries you may have. After resolving your concerns, I'll guide you through starting your financial security plan.
20/1/24, 2:18 PM - +263 77 377 5772: Will do that Sir thank you
20/1/24, 8:18 PM - Dev Edoofa: You are most welcome! We will reconnect on Monday at 4:30 PM to move forward!
22/1/24, 4:47 PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Afternoon Mr. and Mrs. Madzamushi and Ashley!
I hope you are doing well. We have our session right now. May I know if you are ready to take forward our conversation?
22/1/24, 4:54 PM - +263 71 745 9650: Yes sure .
22/1/24, 5:24 PM - +263 71 745 9650: Gud afternoon to you too
22/1/24, 5:26 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Picking up from our last conversation, may I know if you were able to discuss the Edoofa Secure Plan with your family?
22/1/24, 5:28 PM - +263 77 377 5772: Yes we have discussed about it Sir
22/1/24, 5:48 PM - +263 77 377 5772: We find the financial secure plan very useful for it will help        us budget for future plans without mediate inconvinience, hence there are some queations which we would like clarity on it.
1) Is it a must that one needs to engage in this financial secure plan?
2) What if we agree to this term mentioned above and financially we are unable to find the agreed amount .What will happen to us?
23/1/24, 10:58 AM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your queries @263773775772! I was not able to respond as our operational hours were over yesterday. 
Let me clear up your queries:

1. It is absolutely fine if you do not want to engage with this plan, but you must understand that the Edoofa Secure Plan helps families prepare for the finances of their students most conveniently and ensures that students after enrolling in the Edoofa Secure Plan, are not facing problems in managing the finances at the time of coming to India.
2. For this, I understand your concern, and where you are coming from. If I was in your position, I would have had the same concern. After counseling thousands of students over the years, I have a small question. Why do you think such a situation can arise, as you are surely going to be saving some amount for Ashley's higher education in India, right?
23/1/24, 11:40 AM - +263 71 745 9650: I think that this question arose because a lot of students were facing financial problems when it was time to come to India .
23/1/24, 11:42 AM - +263 71 745 9650: Good morning to you all.
23/1/24, 4:39 PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Afternoon @263717459650!
I hope you are doing well.
23/1/24, 4:42 PM - Dev Edoofa: We are aware that most students face such kind of situation. But it is to be noted that they face such situations due to improper preparation of finances. That is why the Edoofa Financial Plan is designed in such a way that students are able to prepare well fro their finances. I hope you are able to understand what I am trying to convey.
23/1/24, 5:24 PM - +263 71 745 9650: Yes we understand
23/1/24, 9:38 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that! We will reconnect at 4:00 PM to take forward our conversation. Till then I wish you a blessed night!
23/1/24, 9:39 PM - +263 71 745 9650: Looking forward to it sir . Have a blessed night also .
24/1/24, 4:21 PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Afternoon Ashley and Parents!
I hope you are doing well. We have our session right now. May I know if you are ready to take forward our session?
24/1/24, 4:23 PM - +263 71 745 9650: Good afternoon sir .
24/1/24, 4:24 PM - +263 71 745 9650: I am not available as l am still at school now.
24/1/24, 4:53 PM - Dev Edoofa: I understand, Ashley! May I know if your parents are available?
24/1/24, 5:19 PM - +263 77 377 5772: Good afternoon Sir
24/1/24, 5:19 PM - +263 77 377 5772: Iam available now
24/1/24, 5:28 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that! Regarding the discussion we had the other day about the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan, I wanted to follow up on our last conversation. Have you, as a family, been able to discuss it? If so, I would like to understand how the discussion went. What were their thoughts about it? Did they have any specific queries or concerns that you would like us to address?
24/1/24, 5:49 PM - +263 77 377 5772: Yes we manage to have a smooth discussion.They really understand how important  (FSP) is.
24/1/24, 5:55 PM - +263 77 377 5772: The only query left unanswered is that,lets say we agreed to start on (FSP) program,we manage to pay 2 months respectively but the 3rd month we do not have money.How are you going to help us or i can say how do you handle those situations
24/1/24, 6:03 PM - Dev Edoofa: It is indeed reassuring to know that you have recognized the importance of the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan. The plan was designed considering the challenges that students face when planning for their education abroad and how we can ensure our students are protected against them.
24/1/24, 6:04 PM - Dev Edoofa: Regarding the query you raised:

The foundation of the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan is built on the fundamentals of consistent saving, and thus, the payment installments are staggered on a monthly basis. The goal is to ensure that you, as a parent, can set aside $1500 for Ashley's education by November 2024, and hence each installment comes down to $150 per month. 

If, as a parent, you feel you cannot raise the $150 for a certain month, please share the same with us. We can better understand your situation and assess the amount you can contribute toward the installment in the same month, and help you cover the balance along with the next month's payment. This staggered structure ensures that you and Ashley don't have to worry about her educational finances when she is in India.

However, in the event a parent misses out on the entire month of payment and is unable to pay, a nominal interest/payment fine would be added to the installment. The interest decreases as you approach your goal of saving $1500 by November.
24/1/24, 6:05 PM - Dev Edoofa: <Media omitted>
24/1/24, 6:33 PM - +263 77 377 5772: Well understood Sir
24/1/24, 6:39 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that @263773775772. I would like to inquire if there are any other queries or concerns on your mind that you would like to discuss?
24/1/24, 6:45 PM - +263 77 377 5772: Let me go through it
24/1/24, 6:48 PM - +263 77 377 5772: So far so good Sir
24/1/24, 6:50 PM - Dev Edoofa: Surely @263773775772. For the current round of students, there are only 27 seats available for the students who can benefit from the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan. 

Since Ashley has been one of the most dedicated students, and I see she has great aspirations, I wanted her to be a part of the same set of students and start with her future planning the right way.
24/1/24, 6:50 PM - Dev Edoofa: Also, as this plan commences from the month of January, for the efficient implementation of this plan, we need to decide on a fixed date on which you will deposit $150 every month. This will provide you with the flexibility to align your finances accordingly.
24/1/24, 6:50 PM - Dev Edoofa: Our complete focus is on providing students and parents with the best ways to avail themselves of these opportunities. We understand that every parent may not be able to make the payment on our specified date. Therefore, considering this situation, we allow them to decide the payment date according to their comfort. In light of the same, may I know the fixed date every month on which you will deposit $150?
24/1/24, 7:19 PM - +263 77 377 5772: Ok on this i think we need to have a family discussion again tonight and we get back to you
24/1/24, 7:19 PM - +263 77 377 5772: Back on this can you explain a bit on those pernalt amounts
24/1/24, 7:19 PM - +263 77 377 5772: Again, as this plan commencing on Jan i can say it will be hard for us to raise the amount because we still want to pay up anothe balance of 150 US which is of the enrolment fee.So according to our financial status we won't manage to raise that but if it was maybe starting in the month of February
24/1/24, 7:20 PM - +263 77 377 5772: Network is now slowing down
24/1/24, 7:27 PM - Dev Edoofa: I see @263773775772, and that is perfectly fine. If you refer to the screenshot I shared with you for your reference, it is from the month of February itself. When I mention that we have 27 seats for January, the process for those 27 seats needs to be completed before January 31, 2024. The first installment for the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan will start from the month of February itself. You can rest assured and plan for the date you would want to pay each month so that the agreement can be aligned accordingly.

With that said, since you mentioned that you want us to help you explain the penalty amounts, can you please help me understand what, in particular, you need me to explain? <This message was edited>
24/1/24, 7:34 PM - +263 77 377 5772: Ok, i want to understand that ,Is the pernalt fee paid when you did not meet the due date of payment or it is paid every month accordingly
24/1/24, 7:36 PM - Dev Edoofa: @263773775772, the penalty fee is paid in case you do not make the payment by the due date that you agreed to as per the financial secure plan. If you refer to my last message, I believe you would be able to address your concern in a better way and hence I would encourage you to just go through the same once again. Let me know once you are done.
25/1/24, 5:44 AM - +263 77 377 5772: Ok ok Sir
25/1/24, 5:28 PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Ashley

Please, how are you doing today? With regards to our discussion yesterday, I wanted to reach out and enquire if you were able to have a further discussion as a family regarding the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan and if you are available for us to connect with each other?
25/1/24, 5:48 PM - +263 77 377 5772: How are you Sir.We surely have a further discussion as a family.
During the discussion period we came to realise that for the next 3 months there will be a financial problem to our side,hence we can not be able to save for (FSP)

Just to highlight on this,
February We had to register for Ashley's exam fee and its expensive too.
2) We also had to pay for Ashley 's Assessment project which is again February and it range to almost 200 US.
25/1/24, 5:50 PM - +263 77 377 5772: It was of our great wish for us to join this (FSP) for future preperation but maybe if we start it on June iam sure by then we might have settled our debts
27/1/24, 6:57 AM - Dev Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Ashley!
I hope you are doing well and are having a wonderful start to the day. Thank you for letting us know about your financial conditions for the next 3 months and we totally understand the challenges that you may face in the future. 

If you start in June then, at that time the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan is not going to be valid as this plan ensures that the parents or guardians can start preparing at the start of this plan and eventually save the amount accordingly. But if you start around June/July, you may not have sufficient savings to have at the time of admission into universities. I hope you understand?
27/1/24, 7:24 AM - +263 77 377 5772: Yes i understand you Sir
27/1/24, 10:38 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that! So I would like you to discuss it with your family again, if the plan is going to be viable for you or not and let me know about your final decision by today.
27/1/24, 1:27 PM - +263 77 377 5772: Ok
29/1/24, 3:44 PM - +263 77 377 5772: Good afternoon Sir,  We smoothly have a discussion as family again but nothing positive come out as we were looking at our financial sources.Hence we want to ask you if it is okey for us to save here at our own pace and strategies inoder for him to reach his desires
29/1/24, 5:40 PM - Dev Edoofa: May I please get to know about the strategies that you have planned out in detail? This will help us to prepare for the further timelines accordingly.
30/1/24, 9:44 AM - Dev Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Ashley!
I hope you are doing well.  I'd like to assist you in getting started with your EWYL Journey. Since there was a delay in the initiation of the EWYL program,   They are prepared to initiate your EWYL program today, i.e. 30th January.

To kick start the process, your dedicated EWYL Mentor has established your EWYL Group and shared the invitation link with us. Here's what you and your parents/guardian/sponsor need to do:

31/1/24, 12:34 PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Afternoon @263717459650!
I hope you are doing well. I have been noticing for the past sessions, that you were not replying to my messages. May I know if you are facing any challenges that led to this delay?
31/1/24, 12:35 PM - +263 71 745 9650: I once sent this message that l've connected with my my EWYL Mentor
31/1/24, 12:36 PM - +263 71 745 9650: My apologies Mr. Dev l was not available on WhatsApp yesterday since the app expired.
31/1/24, 12:41 PM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know, let me check it with the EWYL team once.
31/1/24, 12:42 PM - Dev Edoofa: I understand @263717459650!
31/1/24, 12:51 PM - +263 71 745 9650: Okay
31/1/24, 12:56 PM - Dev Edoofa: Also, may I please get a reply on this?
31/1/24, 1:30 PM - +263 77 377 5772: We have started a small farming project of cabbages and maize  so iam expecting to start harvesting at around end May so if all goes well we might have a better harvest and a huge amount of money (profit ) we earn can  make us budget for Ashley
31/1/24, 1:30 PM - +263 77 377 5772: My apology for late reply netwk was abit slow foe the past few days
31/1/24, 2:17 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you have started thinking and working in the direction of handling the finances of Ashley's higher education. The Edoofa Financial Secure Plan is only going to help you with the better preparation of finances. We understand that for the next 2-3 months, you are a little occupied with some other financial obligations. So, keeping this in mind, I was able to think of a strategy that will accordingly help you save $1500 at the end of November as well as help you avail the benefits that are only provided with the Edoofa Secure Plan. Do you want to know about this strategy?
31/1/24, 2:25 PM - +263 71 745 9650: Yes sure sir.
31/1/24, 2:35 PM - +263 77 377 5772: Absolutely
31/1/24, 2:56 PM - Dev Edoofa: This is a suggestion that you start the plan in February by paying $100 and continue till April. After that, from May to July, you will pay $200 and for the remaining months till November, you will deposit $150. This will not only help you save in a better way but also help you avail the benefits of the plan. Please let me know what you feel about this?
31/1/24, 3:11 PM - +263 77 377 5772: Sound interesting

2/2/24, 5:46 PM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know, @263773775772 @263773725155 . For the current round of students, there are only 27 seats available for the students who can benefit from the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan. 

Since Ashley has been one of the most dedicated students, and I see she has great aspirations, I wanted her to be a part of the same set of students and start with her future planning the right way. <This message was edited>
2/2/24, 5:47 PM - Dev Edoofa: Also, as this plan commences in February, for the efficient implementation of this plan, we need to decide on a fixed date on which you will deposit the discussed amount every month. This will provide you with the flexibility to align your finances accordingly.
2/2/24, 5:47 PM - Dev Edoofa: Our complete focus is on providing students and parents with the best ways to avail themselves of these opportunities. We understand that every parent may not be able to make the payment on our specified date. Therefore, considering this situation, we allow them to decide the payment date according to their comfort. In light of the same, may I know the fixed date every month on which you will deposit the discussed amounts?
