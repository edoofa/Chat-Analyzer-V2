8/1/24, 8:56 PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Alois!
I hope all of you are doing great. While I was wrapping up my day, I observed that we were not able to have a smooth discussion for the past couple of days, which has led to some delay in the admission process. We are aware of your immense trust in us and we surely care about your future. Considering that in mind, I wanted to schedule a specific session tomorrow at 8:30 am so that we can cover the process we are lagging behind,  and ensure that your admission process is on track. Hence, I wanted to understand if you will be available for our session at 8:30am. If not, I would like you to please let me know at what time between 8:30 am to 4 pm will you be available?
8/1/24, 8:57 PM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the above documents I have taken a note of these and will update in our records.
9/1/24, 10:17 AM - Dev Edoofa: Shall we start with our session?
9/1/24, 11:11 AM - +263 77 306 5310: Sorry sir alois was going to school .he said we shall supposed to start session at 4 pm .
9/1/24, 11:11 AM - +263 77 306 5310: How are you sir
9/1/24, 2:10 PM - +263 77 461 7198: Noted
9/1/24, 8:22 PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Alois.

I hope all of you are having a wonderful day. Today I had a meeting with the academic board and I was discussing the current status of your application file and in the same discussion, the team higjlighted that we have been a bit off track for the discusisons we were suppsed to completed and hence I wanted to reach out to you and just reiteratre the agenda of the sessions/discusisons we have in place.
9/1/24, 8:22 PM - Dev Edoofa: The agenda for these sessions is to help you understand the process Alois will undertake for his university admission journey and what your family will be experiencing with the Edoofa Scholarship Program over the next one and a half years. However, since Alois is in school and you are occupied with work during the day, it seems that the same challenge in connectivity is going to persist for the next couple of months as well.
9/1/24, 8:22 PM - Dev Edoofa: If you see, our goal is to help you prepare for your child's education abroad, that is something that is going to require a significant time. It requires months of planning. Hence, to do that perfectly and be prepared, as a parent, you would have to contribute an hour daily for at least 10 days so that we can be in sync and make the right decisions.
9/1/24, 8:22 PM - Dev Edoofa: We, at Edoofa, are determined to provide affordable higher education to hardworking students and assist them in launching their careers to greater heights. We will be able to help you only if we can connect timely and have healthy discussions.
9/1/24, 8:22 PM - Dev Edoofa: With that being said, what I can do right now to solve this constraint is give you the freedom to choose the time slot for our sessions over the next 10 days [till 20th January]. This way, we can align it with our availability as well and help you move forward and make progress in a streamlined manner. Could you please let me know at what time you would be available from Monday to Friday between 08:00 AM and 06:00 PM? This would help us factor in your inputs and find the right time for our sessions.
9/1/24, 10:13 PM - +263 77 461 7198: I think 2 pm is good for me to attend my session
11/1/24, 1:42 PM - +263 77 461 7198: How are you sir I hope you are doing great 

Please connect with my guardian as for now I'm at school so some time I can not be able to connect with you
11/1/24, 2:24 PM - +263 77 461 7198: Hello
15/1/24, 2:44 PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Afternoon Alois and Parents!

We will further connect in our session tomorrow! Wish you a blessed night.

The next batch of EWYL Sessions is scheduled to commence on Friday (19th January) and hence, if we are able to focus and complete the Admission Process before Friday with pure consistency, you will be able to start your EWYL journey as well in a timely manner.
16/1/24, 1:34 PM - Dev Edoofa: Kindly mark this date on your calendar and ensure that you are available to complete the necessary procedures within the stipulated timeline. If everything is proceeding as planned so far, shall we move forward and begin our session for the day?
16/1/24, 1:37 PM - +263 77 306 5310: Noted sir
16/1/24, 1:38 PM - Dev Edoofa: Right, now moving forward, let me brief you that your admissions process and your EWYL program will operate concurrently in the future, therefore you will have two Whatsapp groups to connect with the team:
16/1/24, 1:38 PM - Dev Edoofa: 1. The admissions group *Alois 2K23DEC1526R*  will be the platform where we, as your admission officers, will be communicating with you. This group is dedicated to all-important discussions like your university admission process, offer letter discussion, and ultimately your university registration and reservation of your scholarship along with the Visa process. This group will continue to assist you with your admission-related queries while you are here in India.
16/1/24, 1:38 PM - Dev Edoofa: 2. Earn While You Learn Program *Alois EWYL23E1125*. In this group, your EWYL mentor, head of the department, and head coach will be present. With this group, we will make sure you are prepared to self-finance your education here in India. With your dedicated efforts in the EWYL program, you will earn maximum scholarship credits.

This group will keep a record of the tasks and projects you undertake. You will be provided with the link to the group after the completion of the admission process session and on the dedicated date for your EWYL session, where you will be able to directly speak to your EWYL mentor. I hope you are clear about the purpose of the two groups.
16/1/24, 1:45 PM - +263 77 306 5310: Yes I'm understanding sir
16/1/24, 1:50 PM - Dev Edoofa: Moving forward with the procedures, I would like to share an insight with you. To ensure a seamless experience, we as a team, have prepared essential documents (printed forms) that not only value your feedback but also outline the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program and the application process. You will have to review, complete, and submit these documents as instructed. 

If you are ready, shall I share a brief overview of these documents for your ease?
16/1/24, 1:53 PM - +263 77 306 5310: Yes I'm ready sir
16/1/24, 1:55 PM - Dev Edoofa: You have already shared the printed forms, but maybe you are not aware of why these forms are important. You will get to know now.

26/1/24, 2:26 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that!
26/1/24, 2:26 PM - Dev Edoofa: Moving forward in today's session, we will discuss a bit about your university admission journey. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts. I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them.

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
26/1/24, 2:58 PM - +263 77 306 5310: Ok noted sir
26/1/24, 3:06 PM - Dev Edoofa: <Media omitted>
26/1/24, 3:23 PM - +263 77 306 5310: I'm through the above imange sir
26/1/24, 3:34 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
26/1/24, 3:34 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.
26/1/24, 3:34 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
26/1/24, 3:34 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.
26/1/24, 3:34 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process, the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
26/1/24, 3:34 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
26/1/24, 4:03 PM - +263 77 306 5310: Ok noted sir .so now we are finished step 1 upto 4
26/1/24, 4:07 PM - Dev Edoofa: No @263773065310, we have not started with admission journey. We need to start with the first step of the admission journey today.
26/1/24, 4:10 PM - +263 77 306 5310: Kkkk ok sir
26/1/24, 4:12 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through all 6 steps, if we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
26/1/24, 4:18 PM - +263 77 306 5310: Ok sir  I'm ready
26/1/24, 4:27 PM - Dev Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding until you are ready,

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
26/1/24, 4:33 PM - +263 77 306 5310: Ok sir  sent it .
26/1/24, 4:44 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students*

This is a video by the founders of EDOOFA, in which they share 2 important qualities of successful Edoofians- who've secured a maximum scholarship and earned scholarship credits.

Founders talk about their decade-long journey of discovering these schools and the experiences that students are having in these schools.

26/1/24, 4:45 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP*

The fourth video is about the Statement of Purpose (SOP). The most important step towards securing a good scholarship is to write the Statement of Purpose but to know why it is important, watching this video will clear your doubts and questions.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftsGGGBYMrs&feature=youtu.be
26/1/24, 4:45 PM - Dev Edoofa: @263773065310, I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection.

1/2/24, 11:30 AM - Dev Edoofa: Good Morning @263773065310!
I hope you are doing well. I am glad to hear that you were able to go through all the videos that were shared with you. I believe you were able to feel the essence of the videos and were able to grasp the information conveyed in these videos.
1/2/24, 11:31 AM - Dev Edoofa: Thanks for letting me know.
1/2/24, 11:31 AM - Dev Edoofa: Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose. <This message was edited>
1/2/24, 11:32 AM - Dev Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move Alois' application ahead and help Alois write a proper statement of purpose so that he can get into the best University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on Alois' application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, we would require Alois' availability for approximately 30 minutes. If he is unavailable, he can provide you with his input, and you can proceed with the statement of purpose on his behalf.
1/2/24, 11:33 AM - Dev Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in Alois' admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

3/2/24, 9:31 AM - Dev Edoofa: Good Morning @263773065310!
I hope you are doing well. I have been hoping for a response from your side since yesterday. May I know if we are still connected and ready to take forward the process?
3/2/24, 6:18 PM - +263 77 306 5310: Ok sir sorry let's proceed
3/2/24, 6:18 PM - +263 77 306 5310: How are you
3/2/24, 6:22 PM - +263 77 306 5310: I'm not on line yesterday.sorry for late reply
6/2/24, 12:00 PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Afternoon @263773065310!
I hope you are doing well. Since you replied at the time our operational hours were over, I was not able to reply and take forward the conversation. May I know if you are ready today to take forward the conversation? <This message was edited>
6/2/24, 1:51 PM - +263 77 306 5310: Yes sir I'm ready now
6/2/24, 1:51 PM - +263 77 306 5310: How are you
6/2/24, 1:55 PM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know! I am doing absolutely well.
6/2/24, 1:57 PM - Dev Edoofa: With this consent, you have enabled us to make progress to the third step in Alois' admission journey, i.e. *Introduction to Financial Secure Plan*.
6/2/24, 1:59 PM - Dev Edoofa: Let us move forward with our discussion. To confirm our records: the course that Alois selected for your higher education is BCom (Accounting and International Finance) and it's my understanding that he is planning to arrive in India in August 2025. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
6/2/24, 3:35 PM - +263 77 306 5310: Yes is planning to arrive in India in August 2025 sir you are correct sir
6/2/24, 4:00 PM - Dev Edoofa: Thanks for your confirmation! Based on our experience of over 14 years and having assisted over 5000 students from different countries, we have realized that financial planning is the most important factor when a student plans for their higher education abroad.
6/2/24, 4:00 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am sure that you must be aware that 20-30% of students who are admitted into universities abroad are unable to fulfill their dream and come to India due to a lack of financial planning. The funds needed for booking flights, accommodation, and covering living expenses after arrival often become overwhelming, leading to the decision to defer their admission for a year. This, in turn, creates a gap in the child's education.
6/2/24, 4:00 PM - Dev Edoofa: To assist both students and parents in this regard, Edoofa Management has designed a Financial Secure Plan that aims to help you prepare for your higher educational finances without experiencing stress or last-minute rushes. I believe you must be wondering about the details of the same plan and how it helps the parents?
6/2/24, 8:30 PM - +263 77 306 5310: Ok sir
