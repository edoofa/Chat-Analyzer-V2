Iam born second in a happy and united family being six altogether including parents. 
All my siblings are in school with the support of our parents who are both formerly employed. 
My parents are the ones who encouraged me to apply for the Edoofa Scholarship program and promised to sponsor and support my academic carrier.
28/12/23, 1:09 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing about yourself. It's great to hear about your academic journey and aspirations. Your family sounds wonderfully supportive and cohesive, which is a significant asset in any educational endeavor. Being the second-born in a family of six and having all your siblings also engaged in their studies showcases a strong emphasis on education in your family.

The fact that your parents are both formerly employed and still prioritize and support your and your siblings' education speaks volumes about their dedication to your futures.
28/12/23, 1:09 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Moving forward, I would like to bring an important aspect to your attention. The collective aim that we have for the student strongly values balanced involvement from parents, especially when the student is unable to participate.

28/12/23, 1:13 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Kindly mark this date on your calendar and ensure that you are available to complete the necessary procedures within the stipulated timeline. If everything is proceeding as planned so far, shall we move forward and begin our session for the day?

28/12/23, 1:16 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Right, now moving forward, let me brief you that your admissions process and your EWYL program will operate concurrently in the future, therefore you will have two Whatsapp groups to connect with the team:
28/12/23, 1:16 PM - Kirti Edoofa: 1. The admissions group *(Romeo 2K23DEC1906)*  will be the platform where we, as your admission officers, will be communicating with you. This group is dedicated to all-important discussions like your university admission process, offer letter discussion, and ultimately your university registration and reservation of your scholarship along with the Visa process. This group will continue to assist you with your admission-related queries while you are here in India.
28/12/23, 1:16 PM - Kirti Edoofa: 2. Earn While You Learn Program *(Romeo EWYL23E1088)*. In this group, your EWYL mentor, head of the department, and head coach will be present.

This group will keep a record of the tasks and projects you undertake. You will be provided with the link to the group after the completion of the admission process session and on the dedicated date for your EWYL session, where you will be able to directly speak to your EWYL mentor. I hope you are clear about the purpose of the two groups.
28/12/23, 1:19 PM - +263 78 413 4114: Yes I'm clear
28/12/23, 1:20 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that you are clear about the purpose of the two WhatsApp groups and it's reassuring to hear this from your end.

I must commend your family, must take great pride in your achievements and be dedicated to ensuring your access to the finest opportunities to launch your career.

Speaking of valuable opportunities, I am also curious to learn more about your counseling session with your counselor and to understand which aspects of the Edoofa Scholarship Program have particularly impressed you thus far. Can you share this with me?
28/12/23, 1:31 PM - +263 78 413 4114: Ok thank you. To me so far the whole process is clear and consistent. The counselor highlighted all the six steps of the Edoofa Scholarship program from counseling, eligibility check test upto Admission and Visa.

28/12/23, 1:39 PM - +263 78 413 4114: The EWYL Program is also helpful to us students in that it equips us with the necessary skills and knowledge for our areas of specialisation. It also reduces the burden on tuition fees through credits.

I have known Mr. Kunal for a long time and he always ensures that each and every student of his gets personalized attention so that he can ensure their academic career is on track and I am glad to know that you have a great understanding of the EWYL program and absolutely through EWYL students get to learn more about 21st-century skills that are necessary for today's world to be employable.

You will have to review, complete, and submit these documents as instructed. 

If you are ready, shall I share a brief overview of these documents for your ease?
28/12/23, 1:46 PM - +263 78 413 4114: I'm ready

4. *Include Authority Details*: Ensure that the letter contains the details of the signing authority, including their full name, contact number, and email ID.

The Edoofa Academic Board will use those details to reach out to your school authorities and verify the recommendation letter before adding it to your scholarship application and hence I would like to enquire by when will you be able to share the same document with us?
28/12/23, 2:34 PM - +263 78 413 4114: I have consulted school authorities and they advised me that such letters maybe available after opening of school (9 January 2024)

2/1/24, 3:17 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @263784134114 I completely understand that these challenges can be a hurdle, but I want to emphasize that we haven't managed to engage in a proper discussion. It's vital that we commence our discussion to initiate the admission process, especially if you're aiming to begin the EWYL program on January 5th. I've observed that your peers have progressed beyond the initial forms, with several already finalizing their admission. These hold-ups could result in you lagging behind your peers. Therefore, I would encourage you to participate in the process proactively so that we can move ahead with the forms and your EWYL program can be started on the same day when your batch starts.
2/1/24, 3:34 PM - +263 78 413 4114: I kindly appreciate your advice and encouragement on my proactive participation during the admission phase. I have much hope that the forms are to be completed today.

2/1/24, 4:06 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that, I appreciate that you have considered being proactive. I shall wait for your response at 08:00 pm today regarding the forms.

2/1/24, 8:08 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the counseling feedback form, it is duly noted with us. I was going through your EWYL pledge from however, you have not mentioned the EWYL availability date and the orientation date may I know if you did not understand the question well?
2/1/24, 8:37 PM - +263 78 413 4114: I have read and understood the question, however my challenge with the EWYL availability date of 5 January is that I will be home in the country side where I usually reside during holidays and internet connectivity is not always reliable where as during school term I will be at school where we use the school's Wi-fi which is more reliable. Our school term begins 9 January 2024. In this case I need to be guided accordingly.
2/1/24, 8:40 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that @263784134114. I appreciate you keeping me informed here, before filling in the form. In that case, we have a second EWYL batch on the 9th of January may I know if that will be suitable for you?
2/1/24, 8:42 PM - +263 78 413 4114: Yes it will be suitable
2/1/24, 8:45 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In that case, please update the date in your EWYL pledge form and your orientation date is the next day followed.
2/1/24, 8:54 PM - +263 78 413 4114: <Media omitted>
2/1/24, 8:56 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the updated form, it is noted with us. may I know if you were able to fill out the student application form by now?

With regard to our conversation, I'm reaching out to check if you are now available to connect with us. Doing so will enable us to proceed with our discussion as we had initially intended.
3/1/24, 1:46 PM - +263 78 413 4114: We are doing great
3/1/24, 1:55 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That is great. Now that we are done with the forms, may I know if you are available so that we can continue with our discussion and I can help you understand the university admission process you will be undertaking?
3/1/24, 1:59 PM - +263 78 413 4114: Yes I'm available .You can go on
3/1/24, 2:05 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That is great. Let us now discuss your university admission process. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts. I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them. 

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
3/1/24, 2:09 PM - +263 78 413 4114: I'm ready . We may start
3/1/24, 2:16 PM - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
3/1/24, 2:19 PM - +263 78 413 4114: I'm done
3/1/24, 2:23 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
3/1/24, 2:23 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
3/1/24, 2:25 PM - +263 78 413 4114: Yes they are clear
3/1/24, 2:29 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
3/1/24, 2:29 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
3/1/24, 2:31 PM - +263 78 413 4114: Yes I'm following
3/1/24, 2:42 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
3/1/24, 2:42 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
3/1/24, 2:45 PM - +263 78 413 4114: Yes they are clear
3/1/24, 2:45 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
3/1/24, 2:45 PM - +263 78 413 4114: We may start
3/1/24, 2:46 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
3/1/24, 2:46 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding you are ready, shall we start with our discussion with me individually
3/1/24, 2:46 PM - Kirti Edoofa: For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
3/1/24, 2:48 PM - +263 78 413 4114: You may move forward
3/1/24, 2:50 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students*

This is a video by the founders of EDOOFA, in which they share 2 important qualities of successful Edoofians- who've secured a maximum scholarship and earned scholarship credits.

3/1/24, 2:50 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP*

The fourth video is about the Statement of Purpose (SOP). The most important step towards securing a good scholarship is to write the Statement of Purpose but to know why it is important, watching this video will clear your doubts and questions.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftsGGGBYMrs&feature=youtu.be
3/1/24, 2:50 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection. 

Please go through the 4 videos, our next session will be scheduled after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarize your understanding. Hence I would like to know by when you think you will be able to go through these videos so that we can schedule our next session accordingly?
3/1/24, 3:09 PM - +263 78 413 4114: I may be through with them at 5 :00 pm
3/1/24, 3:20 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that, I shall wait for your response.
3/1/24, 4:34 PM - +263 78 413 4114: I'm through . we may continue
3/1/24, 4:46 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, so could you please share your understanding about the 4 videos?
3/1/24, 4:48 PM - +263 78 413 4114: Students should be teachable and open minded and we should follow instructions
3/1/24, 4:52 PM - +263 78 413 4114: I learnt that Edoofa ' s vision is not just to get students affordable quality education and making students employable through SEELS but also focused on increasing students capacity for success thus making student more responsible and independent
3/1/24, 4:54 PM - +263 78 413 4114: I learnt that we as students understand that Edoofa has invested a lot of time to identify good schools ,colleges and universities .Our founders encourage us to follow instructions so as to prepare and be qualified for these prestigious instructions
3/1/24, 4:58 PM - +263 78 413 4114: I have learnt that the statement of purpose is an important document ,we as students should be prompt in taking action and be deligent in filling out the form
3/1/24, 5:02 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. Let me share my views as well so that it will help you expand your understanding.

*Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students:* In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. 

You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent.
3/1/24, 5:02 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s vision for you:* Here our founders talk about the most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
3/1/24, 5:02 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program:* Talking about the third video, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
3/1/24, 5:02 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP:* Another thing is that Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based. 

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
3/1/24, 5:11 PM - +263 78 413 4114: Thanks for further clarification
3/1/24, 5:46 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Brilliant, Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
3/1/24, 5:46 PM - +263 78 413 4114: Yes we are on the same page
3/1/24, 5:49 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by tomorrow 01:30 PM.
3/1/24, 5:49 PM - Kirti Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded.

4/1/24, 7:17 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing question 1, I shall wait for your response to the remaining questions.
4/1/24, 7:41 PM - +263 78 413 4114: Primary memory is called "the main memory",and is a critical part of a computer's functioning.It is where data is temporarily stored  and  accessed while the computer is functioning only but the data temboralily stored can be lost when the computer is turned off.This means that it is volatile.There are two main parts of primary memory which are R.A.M (read only memory) and the cache memory .R.A.M is the main working memory of a computer .it's used to store data for the programs and process currently running .Cache memory is a type of RAM that is used to store recently accessed data for quick retrival .ROM is non volatile but falls under primary storage because it is directly accessed by the CPU.it is used to store the operating system of a computer or the other important programs that need to be preserved even when the computer is turned off .Secondary storage is also called" non volatile storage" ,is a type of storage that is used to store data for long term .Unlike primary memory ,secondary memory is persistent,which means that the data is stored even when the computer is turned off .Examples include Hard drives ,solid state disks(SSDs),optical disks and flash drives.In addition primary memory is directly accessed by the CPU and secondary memory is accesed through input/output (I/O) devices.
4/1/24, 8:09 PM - +263 78 413 4114: The open systems interconnection model is a theoretical framework that describes how the computer networks communicate with each other .It is broken down into seven layers ,each of each has a specific role in the communication process .At the bottom is the physical layer ,which deals with the actual physical connections between devices for example the HDMI cable ,which is used to connect devices like TVs and game consoles to each other .The next layer is the data link layer ,which manages the flow of data across networks .Then there is the network layer ,which handles routing and addressing .After that the transport layer ,which enables reliable communication between devices .The session layer manages communication sessions between devices so that they can understand each other and finally the application layer is the topmost layer that handles actual applications that users interact with for examble web browsers ,email instant messaging all fall under the application layer.These layers work together to create a cohesive network architecture that allows different devices to communicate with each other .It is important to note that not all networks follow the OSI model exactly for example internet doesn't have a well defined presentation layer.
4/1/24, 8:32 PM - +263 78 413 4114: Operator overloading is a feature of some computer languages that alows operators like +,-,and * to have different meanings depending on the types of values they're operating on .For example in C+++,the + operator can be used to add numbers together ,concatenate strings ,or combine two objects together . In java the plus operator is only used for string concentration .In python ,the plus operator can be used for addition concatenation and object combination .let me go more deeper in each language .In python ,the plus operator can be used to add a value to a variable and also concatenate strings .For example ,you could write a statement like x+=2 to add 2 to a value of x and store the result back in x .You could also write a statement like"hello"+"world" to create the string "hello world" .In C+++ operator overloading is more powerful than in java or python .In addition to defining the behavior of operators like +,-,and * ,you can also define the behavior of the call operator +(()) and the assignment operator (=) .This means that you can create your custom functions and assignment operators of your choice .In Java operator overloading allows you to create multiple methods with the same name ,but different behavior ,based on the context in which they are called operating overloading is not supported for all operators in java ,for example the  ==and!= operators cannot be overloaded .
4/1/24, 8:51 PM - +263 78 413 4114: Technology can help a country's economy in a number of ways including:
Productivity 
- Technology can make production process more efficient , allowing businesses to produce more goods and services with same amount of labor .For example robots can be used to perform repetitive tasks on an assembly line ,increasing efficiency and reducing the need of manual labor.
Access to global markets 
- technology can help connect businesses to markets all over the world ,allowing them to reach a wider customer base .For example Platforms like amazon and Alilaba have made it easier for business to sell their products to customers all over the world .
Government efficiency
- technology can help streamline government processes ,making it easier for citizens to access services and government and provide small benefits .One example of this is the use of blockchain technology .Blockchain is a distributed ledger system that can be used to create secure ,transparent and amper- proof records.
Financial inclusion 
-  technology can help provide access to financial services such as banking and insurance to more people . Mobile banking is a great example of how technology can increase financial inclusion .Technology enabled financial inclusion ,on the other hand can be accessed by anyone with a mobile phone .In conclusion Technology can also help to promote sustainability by reducing amount of energy needed to power up lives .

8/1/24, 8:16 PM - Kirti Edoofa added Dev Edoofa
9/1/24, 12:14 PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Afternoon, Parents and Romeo!

We hope this message finds you well. I am *Mr. Dev Kumar, Admission Officer* at Edoofa. Along with Ms. Vilsha, Head of Admission at Edoofa. Now I will be taking forward your further procedures.

I truly hope that you are as excited as we are to take forward the process. Now before moving forward with the session, may I please know how are you all doing today?
9/1/24, 1:38 PM - +263 78 413 4114: We are doing great.
10/1/24, 8:11 AM - Dev Edoofa: Good Morning Romeo and Parents!
I am glad to hear that! May I know the reason why you were late to the session yesterday? Please let us know if there are any challenges that you are facing.
10/1/24, 10:50 AM - +263 77 378 4057: Hello Mr Kumar I'm Romeo's father and  we are glad to connect with you for the process. Thank you for the follow up. The update is Romeo is back to school for the term and as such we are failing to conduct him as from yesterday. We suspect it has to do with school regulations in terms of possession of cellphones at school. We also suspect that the timing of the session coincided with school activities. 
We are however currently in the process of contacting the school authorities for further clarification since it is our best wish to see Romeo fully exploit his potential in technology, backed by such highly qualified personell and fully equipped and reputable institutions. 
We will give feedback as soon as we consult with the school authorities.
11/1/24, 9:38 AM - +263 78 413 4114: Thank you for checking on me. I apologize for late responding, however this was due to school WIfi upgrading and I am glad to inform you that network connectivity has been successful restored and I will be available on the following times:
6:30 pm  -7:30pm CAT.
I look forward to continue smoothly with the processes.
15/1/24, 9:16 PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Romeo! I hope all of you are doing great. I understand the difficulties that you are facing. Since your proposed timings are out of our operational hours and To ensure a smooth admission process, we will have our session at 10:00 AM tomorrow to take forward our conversation. If Romeo is unable to attend the session, I believe parent should be an active part of these sessions. I hope that you can follow our concern. We will further connect in our session tomorrow! Wish you a blessed night!
16/1/24, 6:11 AM - +263 77 378 4057: Thank you for the concern. I think Romeo may not be able to consistently follow the sessions due to competing times ( from school work).
However as you advised we will be actively engage in today's sessions at 10:00AM CAT.
16/1/24, 10:15 AM - Dev Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Romeo!
How are you all doing today?
16/1/24, 10:15 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that!
16/1/24, 11:01 AM - +263 77 378 4057: We are doing great and how are you
16/1/24, 11:12 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that you are doing fine. I am doing fine as well. Thank you so much for asking.
16/1/24, 11:14 AM - Dev Edoofa: Now moving forward, I got in touch with Ms Kirti and was informed that you have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey. We can now move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*.
16/1/24, 11:20 AM - +263 77 378 4057: It is our pleasure to be in touch with you. You may kindly continue with the counseling process.
16/1/24, 11:22 AM - Dev Edoofa: It is my pleasure as well. Now before moving forward,  To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is B.Tech (Computer Science Engineering) and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2025. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
16/1/24, 11:24 AM - +263 77 378 4057: Yes its B. Tech ( Computer Science Engineering) and arrival in India is planned for August 2025.
16/1/24, 11:27 AM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. Based on our experience of over 14 years and having assisted over 5000 students from different countries, we have realized that financial planning is the most important factor when a student plans for his/her higher education abroad.
16/1/24, 11:27 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am sure that you must be aware that 20-30% of students who are admitted into universities abroad are unable to fulfill their dream and come to India due to a lack of financial planning. The funds needed for booking flights, accommodation, and covering living expenses after arrival often become overwhelming, leading to the decision to defer their admission for a year. This, in turn, creates a gap in the child's education.
16/1/24, 11:27 AM - Dev Edoofa: To assist both students and parents in this regard, Edoofa Management has designed a Financial Secure Plan that aims to help you prepare for your higher educational finances without experiencing stress or last-minute rushes. I believe you must be wondering about the details of the same plan and how it helps the parents?
16/1/24, 11:34 AM - +263 77 378 4057: Of course
16/1/24, 11:41 AM - Dev Edoofa: Edoofa Secure Plan is important for parents who have children joining the university for tertiary education in the next one to two years for several reasons:

*Financial Preparedness:* The Edoofa Secure plan helps parents prepare financially for the costs after the Scholarship being offered so that they are not caught off guard.

*Reduced Financial Stress:* Having the Edoofa Secure Plan in place can significantly reduce the financial stress on you as parents when your child is about to enter university. Knowing that there is a dedicated fund for education expenses provides peace of mind.
16/1/24, 11:42 AM - Dev Edoofa: *Avoiding Debt*: Without proper savings, some parents may resort to taking out loans or accumulating credit card debt to cover their child's education costs. This Educational savings plan helps avoid the burden of debt and high-interest payments.

*Compound Interest:* By starting to save early and consistently contributing to the savings plan, parents can take advantage of compound interest, which can significantly increase the amount available for education expenses.
16/1/24, 11:42 AM - Dev Edoofa: *Flexibility and Control:* The Edoofa Secure savings plans allow parents to have greater control over their finances and how they allocate funds for their child's education. They can choose investment options that align with their risk tolerance and financial goals.

*Encouraging Responsibility*: Involving your child in the process of saving for their education teaches them financial responsibility and the value of higher education. It also motivates them to outperform in Academics.
16/1/24, 11:42 AM - Dev Edoofa: *Adapting to Unexpected Changes*: Life is full of surprises, and circumstances can change especially when there are political reforms changing each day impacting the Local Currency. Having an Edoofa Secure Plan allows parents to adapt to unexpected changes in their financial situation while still prioritizing their child's education.

*Peace of Mind:* Overall, having the Edoofa Secure plan provides parents with peace of mind, knowing that they are actively planning for their child's future and increasing the likelihood of providing them with a solid education.
16/1/24, 11:42 AM - Dev Edoofa: Now, when you go through all the above benefits, I am sure you can see that the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan is an important financial tool for parents/students who are supposed to enter the university soon. 

It helps ensure that the financial aspect of tertiary education is well-managed, reduces stress, and allows parents to provide the best opportunities for their children without resorting to debt or financial hardship. Isn't this something you and your family also wish to have?
16/1/24, 11:56 AM - +263 77 378 4057: We have gone through the benefits of the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan and we wish to have one.
16/1/24, 11:57 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that!

16/1/24, 11:59 AM - +263 77 378 4057: Yes we wish to have such a plan
16/1/24, 12:06 PM - Dev Edoofa: There was a technical glitch which led to the messages being sent again. I hope you understand?
16/1/24, 12:14 PM - +263 77 378 4057: Understandable
16/1/24, 12:19 PM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you! Now that you have gone through the above points, do you want me to help you understand how the Edoofa Secure Plan works?
16/1/24, 12:20 PM - +263 77 378 4057: Yes you may go ahead
16/1/24, 12:24 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, as you are aware, we are currently in January 2024, and we have a good 20-21 months to plan for your finances before you start your university education in 2025.
16/1/24, 12:24 PM - Dev Edoofa: During the counseling session, you were informed that at Edoofa, we guarantee a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship on the tuition fees. Hence, the cost of education, including food and accommodation after the scholarship, would be between $2000-$3000, and it could be even less. Not more than that.
16/1/24, 12:24 PM - Dev Edoofa: This means that if you can save $150 per month for the next 20 months, you will be able to save $3000. This amount is more than enough for the first year of university fees, including tuition fees (if any), food, and accommodation. I hope you agree with this?
16/1/24, 12:40 PM - +263 77 378 4057: Yes we agree
16/1/24, 12:41 PM - Dev Edoofa: Right, this means that by the time you would be in India, you would have already saved the $3000 that will cover the first-year fee.
16/1/24, 12:41 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, in these next 20 months, I am sure you would also be engaged in the EWYL program, and if you secure a minimum of $1000 in 20 months, that means the fees for 1.5 years are already secured.
16/1/24, 12:41 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, for a 3-year course, if we follow the same approach for the remaining 1.5 years, the educational journey for the student and the financial journey for the parent will be easy and smooth. I believe you must be able to see this perspective?
16/1/24, 12:49 PM - +263 77 378 4057: It's clear
16/1/24, 12:50 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. With that said, there is also another benefit, I am sure being in Zimbabwe you know how drastically the exchange rate fluctuates.
16/1/24, 12:50 PM - Dev Edoofa: This message was deleted
16/1/24, 12:50 PM - Dev Edoofa: This message was deleted
16/1/24, 12:51 PM - Dev Edoofa: If you are buying a dollar today, you might be spending 7000 bonds, but if you buy a dollar after a month, the rate would be different.
16/1/24, 12:51 PM - Dev Edoofa: Also, even if you choose to buy dollars every month and save at your home, it is not safe since there is news of robbery, and mugging every day.
16/1/24, 12:51 PM - Dev Edoofa: In that case, you will opt to save in the Bank, but again we know that savings in the Bank require a Nostro Account which means you have to pay the bank to keep your money safe, right?
16/1/24, 12:59 PM - +263 77 378 4057: Ok
16/1/24, 1:13 PM - Dev Edoofa: That is great to hear, considering these constraints, Edoofa Management has decided to help the parents and students prepare for the journey way ahead of time by helping them save money with Edoofa without any additional charges but rather saving additional money as well. Do you want me to explain how this has been achieved?
16/1/24, 1:15 PM - +263 77 378 4057: Yes you can go ahead
16/1/24, 1:19 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Program Fee (Enrollment Fee) that you were asked to pay is $350.
16/1/24, 1:19 PM - Dev Edoofa: Under the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan, a parent has to deposit a small amount of money which is $150 every month for the next 10 months. That means, in 10 months, the money saved will be $1500.
16/1/24, 1:19 PM - Dev Edoofa: Imagine you paying $15 every month to the Bank of Zimbabwe to keep your money safe, and here Edoofa is paying you $15 every month to keep your money safe. Now, you must be wondering, why only for 10 months and not for 20 months, right?
16/1/24, 1:20 PM - +263 77 378 4057: Yes we are aware
16/1/24, 1:21 PM - +263 77 378 4057: Of course may kindly explain
16/1/24, 1:22 PM - Dev Edoofa: If you see the bigger picture, you will realize that the reason is quite simple. Upon the completion of the 10 installments, the Edoofa Admissions team will initiate the Child’s Admission Process by applying early to the universities to secure their scholarship and their university seat.
16/1/24, 1:22 PM - Dev Edoofa: Reserving seats earlier increases the chances of obtaining a maximum scholarship. A higher scholarship means lower fees, and by securing the seat, you will be entitled to pay the fees as per the old fee structure of the university, not the new one implemented in January 2025. Furthermore, when applying to the universities, you will receive an offer letter or a letter of intent detailing the fees, scholarship, and registration fee.
16/1/24, 1:22 PM - Dev Edoofa: As explained during the enrollment process, the registration fee is a portion of your first-year university fee, paid to reserve the seat. It ranges from $500-$1000 and is not an additional fee. 

From the $1500 you saved with Edoofa, the registration fee will be paid to the university, securing the seat. For instance, if the registration fee is $1000, Edoofa will pay $1000 from the $1500 saved in 10 months. The updated balance with Edoofa will be $500, which will be paid to the university upon your arrival in India.
16/1/24, 1:22 PM - Dev Edoofa: This eases the financial burden on the parent, as there is no immediate payment required upon the student's arrival. The $500 saved will cover the remaining fees for the semester/year, as specified in the offer letter from the university. What are your thoughts on this?
16/1/24, 1:36 PM - +263 77 378 4057: It's a good plan as it mitigates against financial burdens and it's encouraging
16/1/24, 1:36 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to see that we are together so far. With this plan for the next 10 months, I am sure you must be wondering what will happen in the next 10 months, considering you have already secured your scholarship seat with the university due to your hard work in the first 10 months. Is my understanding correct?
16/1/24, 7:04 PM - +263 77 378 4057: Yes it's correct
16/1/24, 8:57 PM - Dev Edoofa: I would like to iterate that our operational hours are from 10:00 AM to 6:00PM. Our operational hours are over now. We will connect tomorrow at 2:30pm to move forward with our session.
Wish you a blessed night and don't forget to extend my regards to your family.
17/1/24, 8:31 AM - +263 77 378 4057: Noted with thanks
17/1/24, 2:45 PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Romeo!
How are you all doing?
17/1/24, 2:47 PM - +263 78 413 4114: We are doing great.
17/1/24, 2:56 PM - Dev Edoofa: That is good to know.
17/1/24, 2:57 PM - Dev Edoofa: Shall we start our session for today? <This message was edited>
17/1/24, 2:58 PM - +263 78 413 4114: Yes we can start.
17/1/24, 3:06 PM - Dev Edoofa: That is great to know! In our previous conversation, we were discussing the Edoofa Finacial Secure Plan, but were not able to take forward our conversation. So let's continue from there. What do you feel about that?
17/1/24, 3:48 PM - +263 77 378 4057: Great we may continue
17/1/24, 4:04 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now picking up from our conversation, we were discussing what happens after the student deposits $150 for 10 months.
17/1/24, 4:04 PM - Dev Edoofa: In the 11th month, you will be guided to open an FBC Mastercard bank account in Zimbabwe with a deposit of $150. The reason for this is that when you apply for your student Visa, the Embassy asks for a Bank Statement, and this account will serve that purpose.
17/1/24, 4:04 PM - Dev Edoofa: We understand it might be expensive if you deposit another $1500 for the remaining 10 months in FB  Bank Zimbabwe, so to avoid the same challenges, we have designed the plan accordingly. You will only be depositing for the 11th, 12th, 13th, and 14th month, which is 4 months.
17/1/24, 4:04 PM - Dev Edoofa: Once the 4 months are completed, our Department of Student Welfare (DSW) team will assist you with your visa process. The bank statement will act as one of the required documents, and once you receive the visa, you can withdraw the amount from FBC and book the flight ticket. This will help you utilize the money as well. How does it sound?
17/1/24, 4:10 PM - +263 77 378 4057: It sounds great
17/1/24, 4:13 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, from the 16th Month till the 20th month, considering it is a 6-month window, you can again continue depositing the money ($150) with Edoofa which can be used in the fee as and when required or you can decide to save this $900 of these 6 months with you as well. This is something which you are free to choose. I hope you understand the financial secure plan now?
17/1/24, 4:18 PM - +263 77 378 4057: Yes we now understand it
17/1/24, 4:28 PM - Dev Edoofa: That's great. Now that you have all the information, I want you to take some time and discuss the financial security plan with your family members. Help them understand its importance and details. Once you're done, we can reconnect, have a discussion, and address any queries you may have. After resolving your concerns, I'll guide you through starting your financial security plan. 

 Could you let me know when you think you'll have the discussion with your family? This way, we can schedule our next session accordingly. <This message was edited>
17/1/24, 4:33 PM - +263 77 378 4057: Since this issue needs family consensus it will be convenient during the weekend when we may meet physically and discuss as a family. If we may come back to you on Monday 22 January 2024. How about that?
17/1/24, 4:41 PM - Dev Edoofa: That's perfectly fine. In that case, we will conclude today's conversation, and I will connect with you on Monday to resume our discussion. In the meantime, I hope you'll have a detailed discussion with your family and jot down any questions or thoughts you have regarding the Financial Secure plan.

Wishing you a good day ahead, and please extend our regards to your family.
17/1/24, 4:43 PM - +263 77 378 4057: Thank you have nice day
22/1/24, 4:45 PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Afternoon Mr. and Mrs. Chaduka and Romeo!
I hope you are doing well. We have our session right now. May I know if you are ready to take forward our conversation?
22/1/24, 4:52 PM - +263 77 378 4057: We are doing great and thank you for checking. We may continue with the conversation
22/1/24, 5:18 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to see that you are ready for our session. May I know if you have discussed the Edoofa Secure Plan with your family?
22/1/24, 5:20 PM - +263 77 378 4057: Yes we have discussed the plan
22/1/24, 5:21 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that! May I know if you have any queries regarding the plan?
22/1/24, 5:42 PM - +263 77 378 4057: We have some asks.
1. Is it possible to fluctuate the monthly payments eg $100 for some months, $150 or $200 for some months as long as we target and achieve the $1500 mark after the 10 months. We are saying so since we may get tied with another loan repayment during the first 3 months that may challenge us to pay the $150 monthly payments within this period.
2. In case of any unforseable eventuality that may result in failure to continue with the payments after some months what will happen to the amount contributed. 
Generally the plan is ideal.
22/1/24, 9:33 PM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you @263773784057 for raising your queries. I have taken note of them, let me discuss the first query with our admissions to check if it's possible or not. As for the second query, may I know why you think such kind of situation will arise? You must have prepared some kind of plan from your side to manage Romeo's finances here in India, and on top of that, we are providing you with such a beneficial plan. This plan will not only help your finances for now but for further years as well. I hope you understand what I am trying to convey to you?
23/1/24, 4:12 PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Afternoon Mr.&Mrs. Chaduka and Romeo!
I hope you are doing well. We have our session today. May I know if you are ready for our conversation?
23/1/24, 6:35 PM - +263 77 378 4057: Unfortunately today we had tight work schedules. Sorry for any inconveniences caused.
24/1/24, 10:14 AM - Dev Edoofa: Good Morning Mr. and Mrs. Chaduka!
I hope you are doing well. No worries @263773784057, we can get caught up in our work sometimes. Thank you for letting me know. As for the 1st query that you had, I discussed it with my team in detail. So may I please ask you to send me a breakup of the finances, starting from January to November, how much money you will deposit every month so that you can save $1500 at the end of November? It will help us to get clarity on your plan of preparation and prepare for further timelines as well.
24/1/24, 4:45 PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Afternoon Mr. and Mrs.Chaduka and Romeo!
I hope you are doing well. We have our session right now. May I know if you are available to take forward our conversation?
26/1/24, 11:08 AM - Dev Edoofa: Good Morning Mr. and Mrs. Chaduka!
I hope you are doing well. I have noticed that for the past sessions, we have not been able to have fruitful conversations about Romeo's admission journey. May I know if you are facing any challenges in attending these session? It will help us to align ourselves accordingly and help you tackle them.
27/1/24, 10:18 AM - Dev Edoofa: Good Morning Mr. and Mrs. Chaduka!
I hope you are doing well. I understand that you may maybe caught up in some work, and such situations can arise. Please let em know whenever you are free so that we can move forward with our discussion. Have a great day ahead!
30/1/24, 2:49 PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Romeo

I hope you are doing well. I was expecting a response from your end the past couple of days and hence I wanted to reach out to you once again and see if we are still connected. 

At the same time, I was going through your application file and as per the same, you are supposed to make the payment of your remaining part of the Edoofa Enrollment fee of $150 before 27 January 2024. 

In light of this, I wanted to reach out to you, share a gentle reminder, and try to understand if you have been able to make the payment of your fee by now so that we can update the academic board accordingly?
30/1/24, 5:34 PM - +263 77 378 4057: Hello Mr Kumar. Thank you for reaching us. We are still connected, however competing times are sometimes a challenge. Hope to have a consistent conversation going forward.
We have paid the remaining $150 through Mukuru before 27 January 2024 and send confirmation of payment to Mr Jerera and the counselor like we did with the initial payment of $200.
30/1/24, 5:58 PM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for informing me about this @263773784057. May I please ask you to share the receipt of the payment? It will help us to crosscheck our records with the accounts team.
30/1/24, 6:30 PM - +263 77 378 4057: Mukuru: U paid $158 including fee $8.00 for Order 116687488 to Precious Jerera ($150 MukuruPay Voucher: 9P4AJJ43). T&C’s http://bit.ly/2AD6xf9
31/1/24, 9:45 AM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the payment message with us. I have taken complete note of it and will update our accounts team as well.
31/1/24, 1:27 PM - +263 77 378 4057: Thank you for the appreciation. As for our Edoofa Plan and from our previous discussions we have come up with the below payment plan.
March_$100
April-$200
May-$150 
June $200
July -$150
August-$150
September-$150
October-$200
November-$200
Total= $1 500.
31/1/24, 1:53 PM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the detailed plan @263773784057. It is completely alright. Now, for the current round of students, there are only 27 seats available for the students who can benefit from the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan. 

Since Romeo has been one of the most dedicated students, and I see he has great aspirations, I wanted him to be a part of the same set of students and start with her future planning the right way. <This message was edited>
31/1/24, 1:54 PM - Dev Edoofa: This message was deleted
31/1/24, 1:54 PM - Dev Edoofa: Our complete focus is on providing students and parents with the best ways to avail themselves of these opportunities.
