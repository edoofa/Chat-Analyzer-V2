29/1/24, 12:00 PM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the forms. On the last page of the EWYL Guide form, I would like you to change the EWYL availability and orientation dates to 2nd Feb 2024 instead of the ones you have mentioned.
29/1/24, 12:22 PM - +263 71 873 1244: Okeyyy so should I cancel
29/1/24, 12:23 PM - Dev Edoofa: Yes, you can just strike it off and write the above mentioned date besides it.
29/1/24, 1:31 PM - +263 71 873 1244: <Media omitted>
29/1/24, 1:39 PM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the form. I have taken note of it and will update it in our records as well.
29/1/24, 1:39 PM - Dev Edoofa: Moving forward in today's session, we will discuss a bit about your university admission journey. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts. I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them.

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
29/1/24, 1:43 PM - +263 71 873 1244: Yes we can start
29/1/24, 1:47 PM - Dev Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/1/24, 1:51 PM - +263 71 873 1244: Done
29/1/24, 1:53 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
29/1/24, 1:53 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
29/1/24, 1:55 PM - +263 71 873 1244: Very clear
29/1/24, 2:03 PM - Dev Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps - 

*Step 3: Introduction to the Financial Secure Plan* - Parents with children embarking on their university journey within the next one to two years face important decision-making and rigorous financial planning. Edoofa recognizes the significance of this transition and hence has introduced the Edoofa Secure Plan - a unique and systematic strategy to empower parents in financial planning and preparing for their child's tertiary education well in advance.
29/1/24, 2:03 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Scholarship Offer Letter from the university would be issued next year in the month of August.

I hope you are following?
29/1/24, 2:19 PM - +263 71 873 1244: Following
29/1/24, 2:27 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. The registration fee will be paid through the savings you have accumulated visa the Financial Secure Plan. After the registration fee is paid, for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
29/1/24, 2:27 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
29/1/24, 2:31 PM - +263 71 873 1244: Yes very clear
29/1/24, 2:40 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through all 6 steps, if we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
29/1/24, 2:43 PM - +263 71 873 1244: Yes iam available
29/1/24, 2:49 PM - +263 71 873 1244: But will be going offline after Abt 30 minutes it will be starting to be busy at work
29/1/24, 2:51 PM - Dev Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
29/1/24, 2:51 PM - Dev Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding. For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
29/1/24, 2:52 PM - +263 71 873 1244: Yes share plizzz
29/1/24, 2:54 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students*

This is a video by the founders of EDOOFA, in which they share 2 important qualities of successful Edoofians- who've secured a maximum scholarship and earned scholarship credits.

https://youtu.be/SIh6DcQsqYM
29/1/24, 2:54 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s vision for you*

This is another video of the founders, where they share the vision of Edoofa at a core level. Founders also talk more about the most important character trait that distinguishes a successful student from the rest of the crowd.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q44qkd4wc7o
29/1/24, 2:54 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

The third video is about Schools, Colleges, and Universities. I'm sure you're excited to learn more about the schools, colleges, and universities on the Edoofa Platform. Founders talk about their decade-long journey of discovering these schools and the experiences that students are having in these schools.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DW82emflFHw&feature=youtu.be
29/1/24, 2:54 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP*

The fourth video is about the Statement of Purpose (SOP). The most important step towards securing a good scholarship is to write the Statement of Purpose but to know why it is important, watching this video will clear your doubts and questions.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftsGGGBYMrs&feature=youtu.be
29/1/24, 2:54 PM - Dev Edoofa: I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection. 

Please go through the 4 videos, our next session will be scheduled for tomorrow after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarize your understanding.
29/1/24, 2:55 PM - +263 71 873 1244: Alright thank you so much
29/1/24, 2:57 PM - Dev Edoofa: You are most welcome! We will meet tomorrow at 12:30 PM. I hope by then you will be able to go through the videos. If you have any queries or concerns before then, feel free to share them here in your admission group. Wish you a blessed day ahead and please ensure to extend our regards to your family as well.

30/1/24, 2:40 PM - +263 71 873 1244: Yes Mr Dev
30/1/24, 2:42 PM - Dev Edoofa: Great! Now, it is our responsibility to move Paul's application ahead and help Paul write a proper statement of purpose so that he can get into the best University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on Paul's application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, we would require Paul's availability for approximately 30 minutes. If he is unavailable, he can provide you with his input, and you can proceed with the statement of purpose on his behalf.
30/1/24, 2:42 PM - Dev Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in Paul's admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

https://goo.gl/forms/iWss6zPuOFbnGTXK2

Hence, could you kindly confirm when you will be able to complete these tasks and reconnect with us? This will allow us to schedule our discussion accordingly.
30/1/24, 2:45 PM - +263 71 873 1244: This should be done by Paul am I correct

2/2/24, 1:27 PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Afternoon @263718731244 @263713929263!
I hope you are doing well. I was hoping to get a reply from your side yesterday. May I know if you are available to take forward the session today? Till the time we move ahead, Paul can send the response by today. This will ensure that Paul's admission journey is not affected.
2/2/24, 1:36 PM - +263 71 873 1244: Good afternoon
2/2/24, 1:40 PM - Dev Edoofa: How are you doing @263718731244?
2/2/24, 1:49 PM - +263 71 873 1244: We doing fine
2/2/24, 1:50 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that! Shall we move take ahead our conversation?
2/2/24, 1:50 PM - +263 71 873 1244: I hope he will join us shortly and answer all the questions  the challenge he might be facing is network
2/2/24, 1:51 PM - +263 71 873 1244: Yes
2/2/24, 1:51 PM - Dev Edoofa: No worries! I understand. Till the time Paul sends his answers, we can move forward with the process.
2/2/24, 1:52 PM - Dev Edoofa: we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey, i.e. *Introduction to Financial Secure Plan*.
2/2/24, 1:54 PM - Dev Edoofa: However, before we start the same, I was going through your scholarship application file and noticed that you are supposed to make the payment of your remaining part of Edoofa Enrollment fee. Hence, I thought of sharing a gentle reminder with you and trying to understand how your preparation has been so far? Have you been able to align your preparations in the right direction?
2/2/24, 1:58 PM - +263 71 873 1244: Yes that one will be paid on the 15 th of February wth no doubt
2/2/24, 1:59 PM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. We will reconnect with each other a few days before your due date to take a follow up on this and understand your preparations better.
2/2/24, 1:59 PM - Dev Edoofa: In the meantime, Let us move forward with our discussion. To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is BBA and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2025. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
2/2/24, 2:03 PM - +263 71 873 1244: Correct
2/2/24, 2:03 PM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. Based on our experience of over 14 years and having assisted over 5000 students from different countries, we have realized that financial planning is the most important factor when a student plans for their higher education abroad.
2/2/24, 2:03 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am sure that you must be aware that 20-30% of students who are admitted into universities abroad are unable to fulfill their dream and come to India due to a lack of financial planning. The funds needed for booking flights, accommodation, and covering living expenses after arrival often become overwhelming, leading to the decision to defer their admission for a year. This, in turn, creates a gap in the child's education.
2/2/24, 2:03 PM - Dev Edoofa: To assist both students and parents in this regard, Edoofa Management has designed a Financial Secure Plan that aims to help you prepare for your higher educational finances without experiencing stress or last-minute rushes. I believe you must be wondering about the details of the same plan and how it helps the parents?
2/2/24, 2:23 PM - +263 71 873 1244: Yes further yr details plizz
2/2/24, 2:24 PM - Dev Edoofa: Edoofa Secure Plan is important for parents who have children joining the university for tertiary education in the next one to two years for several reasons:
2/2/24, 2:24 PM - Dev Edoofa: 1. *Financial Preparedness:* The Edoofa Secure plan helps parents prepare financially for the costs after the Scholarship being offered so that they are not caught off guard.

2. *Reduced Financial Stress:* Having the Edoofa Secure Plan in place can significantly reduce the financial stress on you as parents when your child is about to enter university. Knowing that there is a dedicated fund for education expenses provides peace of mind.
2/2/24, 2:24 PM - Dev Edoofa: 3. *Avoiding Debt*: Without proper savings, some parents may resort to taking out loans or accumulating credit card debt to cover their child's education costs. This Educational savings plan helps avoid the burden of debt and high-interest payments.

4. *Compound Interest:* By starting to save early and consistently contributing to the savings plan, parents can take advantage of compound interest, which can significantly increase the amount available for education expenses.
2/2/24, 2:24 PM - Dev Edoofa: 5. *Flexibility and Control:* The Edoofa Secure savings plans allow parents to have greater control over their finances and how they allocate funds for their child's education. They can choose investment options that align with their risk tolerance and financial goals.

6. *Encouraging Responsibility*: Involving your child in the process of saving for their education teaches them financial responsibility and the value of higher education. It also motivates them to outperform in Academics.
2/2/24, 2:24 PM - Dev Edoofa: 7. *Adapting to Unexpected Changes*: Life is full of surprises, and circumstances can change especially when there are political reforms changing each day impacting the Local Currency. Having an Edoofa Secure Plan allows parents to adapt to unexpected changes in their financial situation while still prioritizing their child's education.

8. *Peace of Mind:* Overall, having the Edoofa Secure plan provides parents with peace of mind, knowing that they are actively planning for their child's future and increasing the likelihood of providing them with a solid education.
2/2/24, 2:24 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, when you go through all the above benefits, I am sure you can see that the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan is an important financial tool for parents/students who are supposed to enter the university soon. 

It helps ensure that the financial aspect of tertiary education is well-managed, reduces stress, and allows parents to provide the best opportunities for their children without resorting to debt or financial hardship. Isn't this something you and your family also wish to have?
2/2/24, 2:41 PM - +263 71 873 1244: Queit understandable
2/2/24, 2:42 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through the above points, do you want me to help you understand how the Edoofa Secure Plan works?
2/2/24, 2:42 PM - +263 71 873 1244: Yes
2/2/24, 2:45 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, as you are aware, we are currently in February 2024, and we have a good 20 months to plan for your finances before you start your university education in 2025.
2/2/24, 2:45 PM - Dev Edoofa: During the counseling session, you were informed that at Edoofa, we guarantee a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship on the tuition fees. Hence, the cost of education, including food and accommodation after the scholarship, would be between $2000-$3000, and it could be even less. Not more than that.
2/2/24, 2:45 PM - Dev Edoofa: This means that if you can save $150 per month for the next 20 months, you will be able to save $3000. This amount is more than enough for the first year of university fees, including tuition fees (if any), food, and accommodation. I hope you agree with this?
2/2/24, 3:02 PM - Dev Edoofa: Are you available @263718731244 ?
2/2/24, 3:05 PM - +263 71 873 1244: I was still reading
2/2/24, 3:06 PM - +263 71 873 1244: Yes
2/2/24, 3:06 PM - +263 71 873 1244: You can continue
2/2/24, 3:06 PM - Dev Edoofa: Okay okay, @263718731244!
2/2/24, 3:06 PM - Dev Edoofa: Right, this means that by the time you would be in India, you would have already saved the $3000 that will cover the first-year fee.
2/2/24, 3:06 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, in these next 20 months, I am sure you would also be engaged in the EWYL program, and if you secure a minimum of $1000 in 20 months, that means the fees for 1.5 years are already secured.
2/2/24, 3:06 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, for a 3-year course, if we follow the same approach for the remaining 1.5 years, the educational journey for the student and the financial journey for the parent will be easy and smooth. I believe you must be able to see this perspective?
2/2/24, 3:08 PM - +263 71 873 1244: Yes yes
2/2/24, 3:08 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. With that said, there is also another benefit, I am sure being in Zimbabwe you know how drastically the exchange rate fluctuates.
2/2/24, 3:08 PM - Dev Edoofa: If you are buying a dollar today, you might be spending 7000 bonds, but if you buy a dollar after a month, the rate would be different.
2/2/24, 3:08 PM - Dev Edoofa: Also, even if you choose to buy dollars every month and save at your home, it is not safe since there is news of robbery, and mugging every day.
2/2/24, 3:08 PM - Dev Edoofa: In that case, you will opt to save in the Bank, but again we know that savings in the Bank require a Nostro Account which means you have to pay the bank to keep your money safe, right?
2/2/24, 3:09 PM - +263 71 392 9263: Good afternoon
2/2/24, 3:09 PM - +263 71 392 9263: Yes yes
2/2/24, 3:10 PM - Dev Edoofa: That is great to hear. Considering these constraints, Edoofa Management has decided to help the parents and students prepare for the journey way ahead of time by helping them save money with Edoofa without any additional charges but rather saving additional money as well. Do you want me to explain how this has been achieved?
2/2/24, 3:11 PM - +263 71 392 9263: Yes please
2/2/24, 3:11 PM - +263 71 873 1244: Paul continue with the session pliz iam now busy at work
2/2/24, 3:14 PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Afternoon Paul!
Let's move forward
2/2/24, 3:16 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Program Fee (Enrollment Fee) that you were asked to pay is $350. From the $350, you have already paid $200, and the remaining $150 is what you are planning to pay by tomorrow before your due date of February 15, 2024.
2/2/24, 3:16 PM - Dev Edoofa: Under the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan, a parent has to deposit a small amount of money which is $150 every month for the next 10 months. 

That means, in 10 months, the money saved will be $1500. When this money is saved, Edoofa will waive off the remaining $150 which was due from the Edoofa Program/Enrollment Fee of $350, thereby making a straight saving of $150 in 10 months.
2/2/24, 3:16 PM - Dev Edoofa: Imagine you paying $15 every month to the Bank of Zimbabwe to keep your money safe, and here Edoofa is paying you $15 every month to keep your money safe. Now, you must be wondering, why only for 10 months and not for 20 months, right?
2/2/24, 8:24 PM - +263 71 392 9263: Good evening iam sorry for the late replies , I will show improvement
2/2/24, 9:12 PM - +263 71 873 1244: Yes
3/2/24, 8:20 AM - Dev Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Paul!
I hope you are doing well. I understand @263713929263 and looking forward to a more proactive participation from your side. Since we were not able to take forward our session yesterday, May I know if you are available for a session today?
3/2/24, 8:53 AM - +263 71 392 9263: Yes iam available
3/2/24, 8:53 AM - +263 71 392 9263: Good morning
3/2/24, 8:58 AM - Dev Edoofa: That is good to know!
3/2/24, 8:58 AM - Dev Edoofa: May I know if such question arises in your mind when you read the above messages?
3/2/24, 8:59 AM - +263 71 392 9263: Yes it does arise
3/2/24, 9:03 AM - Dev Edoofa: If you see the bigger picture, you will realize that the reason is quite simple. Upon the completion of the 10 installments, the Edoofa Admissions team will initiate the Child’s Admission Process by applying early to the universities to secure their scholarship and their university seat.
3/2/24, 9:03 AM - Dev Edoofa: Reserving seats earlier increases the chances of obtaining a maximum scholarship. A higher scholarship means lower fees, and by securing the seat, you will be entitled to pay the fees as per the old fee structure of the university, not the new one implemented in January 2025. Furthermore, when applying to the universities, you will receive an offer letter or a letter of intent detailing the fees, scholarship, and registration fees.
3/2/24, 9:03 AM - Dev Edoofa: As explained during the enrollment process, the registration fee is a portion of your first-year university fee, paid to reserve the seat. It ranges from $500-$1000 and is not an additional fee. 

From the $1500 you saved with Edoofa, the registration fee will be paid to the university, securing the seat. For instance, if the registration fee is $1000, Edoofa will pay $1000 from the $1500 saved in 10 months. The updated balance with Edoofa will be $500, which will be paid to the university upon your arrival in India.
3/2/24, 9:03 AM - Dev Edoofa: This eases the financial burden on the parent, as there is no immediate payment required upon the student's arrival. The $500 saved will cover the remaining fees for the semester/year, as specified in the offer letter from the university. What are your thoughts on this?
3/2/24, 9:09 AM - +263 71 392 9263: I think it's a good  process ...very beneficial
3/2/24, 9:10 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to see that we are together so far. With this plan for the next 10 months, I am sure you must be wondering what will happen in the next 10 months, considering you have already secured your scholarship seat with the university due to your hard work in the first 10 months. Is my understanding correct?
4/2/24, 12:46 PM - +263 71 392 9263: Good afternoon
6/2/24, 2:03 PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Paul!
I hope you are doing well. I have been busy with personal commitments for the past few days, resulting in my unavailability. I hope you understand. Now, may I know it you are ready to take forward this conversation today?
6/2/24, 2:41 PM - +263 71 873 1244: Iam not available at the moment
6/2/24, 3:13 PM - +263 71 392 9263: Good after noon ....I understand

Yes iam ready
6/2/24, 3:26 PM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for informing.
6/2/24, 3:27 PM - Dev Edoofa: May I know if you were able to follow our conversation in our last session the other day?
6/2/24, 3:28 PM - +263 71 392 9263: I managed to follow up
6/2/24, 3:29 PM - Dev Edoofa: That is good to know!
6/2/24, 3:35 PM - Dev Edoofa: In the 11th month, you will be guided to open an FBC Mastercard bank account in Zimbabwe with a deposit of $150. The reason for this is that when you apply for your student Visa, the Embassy asks for a Bank Statement, and this account will serve that purpose.
6/2/24, 3:36 PM - Dev Edoofa: We understand it might be expensive if you deposit another $1500 for the remaining 10 months in FB  Bank Zimbabwe, so to avoid the same challenges, we have designed the plan accordingly. You will only be depositing for the 11th, 12th, 13th, and 14th month, which is 4 months.
6/2/24, 3:36 PM - Dev Edoofa: Once the 4 months are completed, our Department of Student Welfare (DSW) team will assist you with your visa process. The bank statement will act as one of the required documents, and once you receive the visa, you can withdraw the amount from FBC and book the flight ticket. This will help you utilize the money as well.
6/2/24, 3:36 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, from the 16th Month till the 20th month, considering it is a 6-month window, you can again continue depositing the money ($150) with Edoofa which can be used in the fee as and when required or you can decide to save this $900 of these 6 months with you as well. This is something which you are free to choose. I hope you have understood the financial secure plan now?
