I trust this message finds you in good health. As we step into the second week of January, I wanted to reach out and share an exciting milestone that India as a country achieved within the first week of 2024 - the successful India's Chandrayaan-3 Engine Test. <This message was edited>

It signifies a significant scientific advancement, laying the groundwork for future progress.
16/1/24, 10:01 AM - Ashi Edoofa: This achievement has not only pushed boundaries but also inspired young minds all over the world to pursue their dreams. On the same note, I wanted to extend my heartiest wishes for the New Year to you and your family and check in to see how you and your family started your year?
24/1/24, 9:29 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Greetings dear parent and Tinashe,
*I am Mr Austin, Senior Career Counsellor at Edoofa*
I hope you all are doing well

If you recall, I hosted your counselling and evaluation sessions, and you made me proud by qualifying for our prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program. I received results from all my students, happy and exhilarating with joy. Recalling our interaction together after a frantic search for your name I ended up messaging you today. I understand your calibre and had a discussion with the Admissions Head and have decided to *personally look after your admission process so that we can proceed with your application on priority through the best possible opportunities and exposures.*

Hence, I request you to come online at *12:00 pm CAT today* and notify on this platform so that I can guide you ahead.
24/1/24, 12:21 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Greetings to you all!
I am here to guide you through the further proceedings of the program and guide you ahead

24/1/24, 1:34 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: At the same time, I was going through your Admissions Group and was shocked to see that you weren't able to complete the University registration process while Tinashe being a bright student and I still remember his passion for career and goals.

May I know, what exactly happened due to which you weren't able to proceed and what are your plans for Tinashe as of now?
