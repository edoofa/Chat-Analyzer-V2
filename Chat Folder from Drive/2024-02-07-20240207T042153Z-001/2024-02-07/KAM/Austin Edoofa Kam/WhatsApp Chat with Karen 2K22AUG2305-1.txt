12/1/24, 5:43 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Karen,

I trust this message finds you in good health. As we step into the second week of January, I wanted to reach out and share an exciting milestone that India as a country achieved within the first week of 2024 - the successful India's Chandrayaan-3 Engine Test.
12/1/24, 5:43 PM - Kirti Edoofa: This accomplishment is responsible for the third lunar mission, aiming to land a rover on the Moon's south polar region and conduct scientific studies that could check Moon's viability to sustain life. It signifies a significant scientific advancement, laying the groundwork for future progress.
12/1/24, 5:43 PM - Kirti Edoofa: This achievement has not only pushed boundaries but also inspired young minds all over the world to pursue their dreams. On the same note, I wanted to extend my heartiest wishes for the New Year to you and your family and check in to see how you and your family started your year?
16/1/24, 12:05 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Proud Edoofians,

I trust this message finds you well, and I hope you are in high spirits. In recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their A-Level results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey.
16/1/24, 12:05 PM - Kirti Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?

29/1/24, 1:40 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Greetings dear parents and Karen,
*I am Mr Austin, Senior Career Counsellor at Edoofa*
I hope you all are doing well

If you recall, I hosted your counselling and evaluation sessions, and you made me proud by qualifying for our prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program. I received results from all my students, happy and exhilarating with joy. Recalling our interaction together after a frantic search for your name I ended up messaging you today. I understand your calibre and had a discussion with the Admissions Head and have decided to *personally look after your admission process so that we can proceed with your application on priority through the best possible opportunities and exposures.*

Hence, I request you to come online and notify on this platform so that I can guide you ahead.
29/1/24, 8:24 PM - +263 77 329 4485: Hello Mr Austin

30/1/24, 10:42 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: At the same time, I was going through your Admissions Group and was shocked to see that you are yet to complete the University registration process being a bright student and I still remember your passion for career and goals, making you one of my favourite students. I personally had a discussion with the Admissions Head and have decided to help you in the best possible way as I understand your calibre.  So, inorder to begin with the process, can you please share your A level results

30/1/24, 11:06 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Can you please send a picture of it and what happened please?
30/1/24, 11:07 AM - +263 71 759 7158: I haven't collected my result slip yet from school
30/1/24, 11:35 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Noted Karen, you can send a picture once you have collected
30/1/24, 11:36 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: At the same time, do you know we at EDOOFA received 2000 Applications in a Single Day just a week before and each day since then we are receiving not less than 1000 Applications each day from students seeking Scholarship? We were overwhelmed and had to reject more applications because of limited seats however were surely intrigued to know the reasons for such an immediate upsurge. Having conversations with my other students who are already preparing to arrive in India under the Edoofa Scholarship shared some mind-boggling Screenshots from the Fee Prospectus of the Universities in Zimbabwe.

*I am sure you and your family must have also discussed this,*. So what have you decided for your future ahead?
30/1/24, 11:38 AM - +263 71 759 7158: We are seeking higher education comparing costs of different universities
30/1/24, 11:41 AM - +263 71 759 7158: Currently we can only focus on Nust and University of Zimbabwe here in Zimbabwe because they are the only universities offering Chemical Engineering
30/1/24, 11:42 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Well Karen, the last time we discussed you were inclined to Computer Science Engineering. May I know what happened?
30/1/24, 11:43 AM - +263 71 759 7158: I ended up changing because l had to look deeper into both programs Chemical and Computer Engineering then l opted Chemical
30/1/24, 11:46 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Noted Karen, so what are the reasons or factors that motivated you to switch to Chemical Engineering?
30/1/24, 11:47 AM - +263 71 759 7158: I want to be able to have my own  production firms
30/1/24, 11:52 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Noted and which type of production are you looking forward to?

30/1/24, 11:58 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: That is a grat aspiration Karen,is there anyone in your family currently working or studying in this field and is motivating you?
30/1/24, 11:58 AM - +263 71 759 7158: Yes there is but currently based in South Africa
30/1/24, 12:01 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Noted Karen, so have you researched on the cut off points of the local universities for Chemical Engineering?
30/1/24, 12:02 PM - +263 71 759 7158: They are just saying 3 A level passes in their circulars
30/1/24, 12:03 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Noted Karen, so do you prefer studying the course in your country or abroad?
30/1/24, 12:04 PM - +263 71 759 7158: Both ,either abroad or in my country l don't mind

30/1/24, 12:08 PM - +263 71 759 7158: No l didn't discuss with them
30/1/24, 12:09 PM - +263 71 759 7158: But l managed to get in contact with a girl you sent her number and we talked she said its nice it's interesting...
30/1/24, 12:12 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Glad to hear that, Karen!
30/1/24, 12:12 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Being a career counsellor, my aspirations for young learners like you are similar. I firmly believe higher education should combine the following for a learner to achieve their goals:-

Quality Education
Conducive Environment
Critical Thinking and Practical learning skills
Technological Literacy and Attachments
Cultural Awareness and Global Perspective
Career guidance, Mentorships, etc.

*However, not everyone achieves success. Do you know why*?
30/1/24, 12:13 PM - +263 71 759 7158: No l dont
30/1/24, 12:13 PM - +263 71 759 7158: I think some are not exposed to enough resources
30/1/24, 12:13 PM - +263 71 759 7158: Others are deprived of education opportunities
30/1/24, 12:25 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: That is right, Karen!
30/1/24, 12:25 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: This message was deleted
30/1/24, 12:26 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
30/1/24, 12:26 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Therefore, It is important to know the facts of Edoofa's guidance and uniqueness compared to the normal University approach.

1) *Personalized mentorship and guidance throughout your course:-* As your Career Counsellor, I have known you since the beginning of the process, understanding your interests, aspirations, family background and plans for your career, unlike a University officer who may come across your application for the first time and treats with the same importance like others. I personally understand where you come from and what is required for you to be successful.
30/1/24, 12:26 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
30/1/24, 12:26 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: 3) *Financial Support and Planning:-* With a flexible payment plan for registration fees spreading across 45 days, the remaining cost of education can be paid in two installments. Students are ensured to open Indian bank accounts so that parents can even deposit the fees in monthly installments.

30/1/24, 12:28 PM - +263 71 759 7158: This is great
30/1/24, 12:28 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: These are aspects that no other organization or University possesses as of now, I hope you are looking forward to such an opportunity for your career, aren't you?
30/1/24, 12:29 PM - +263 71 759 7158: I am indeed
30/1/24, 12:33 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Good to hear that, so do you wish to switch your course to Bachelor of Technology in Chemical Engineering through the Edoofa Scholarship Program>?
30/1/24, 12:34 PM - +263 71 759 7158: Yes
30/1/24, 12:35 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Noted Karen
30/1/24, 12:36 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: As I have promised, the Edoofa Admissions team will be submitting your application to multiple universities that will evaluate your application and upon being eligible, you receive the offer letters with comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. *I will guide you to the best education institution/university associated with us that aligns with your vision and interest and would provide you with a conducive environment for your holistic development and to fulfil your career goals.*

Upon receiving the Offer Letter, you will have a few weeks to pay a portion of your university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. We discussed the registration fee during our counselling sessions. May I know, what do you recall about the same now?
30/1/24, 12:36 PM - +263 71 759 7158: Thank you
30/1/24, 12:37 PM - +263 71 759 7158: Registration fee is a fee of 750 USD if lm not mistaken
30/1/24, 12:38 PM - +263 71 759 7158: I'm hoping to see you Mr Austin given the chance l manage to come over there 😂😂😂
30/1/24, 12:50 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Let me help you with a better understanding. *Usually, the registration fee is an additional fee apart from the cost of education but Edoofians receive an exclusive benefit where it is a part of the cost of education itself.* Let me give you an example:-
30/1/24, 12:51 PM - +263 71 759 7158: Okay waiting
30/1/24, 12:51 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: As we discussed in the counseling session, the cost of education in India ranges from $6000-$8000 per annum which is reduced to $2700-$3700 per annum(the cost is higher for Chemical Engineering as it is a niche course and demanding) through the Edoofa Scholarship Program which includes the registration fee, remaining tuition fees, Accommodation, Food, Wifi, Laundry, library fee etc. Now, let us assume,

1. Tuition Fee: $2600 per annum
2. Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Total Fee: Tuition Fee $2600 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $3600 per annum
3. Registration Fee to be paid: $1000
30/1/24, 12:53 PM - +263 71 759 7158: So the registration fee is to be paid all at once?
30/1/24, 12:53 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: This means this registration fee will be waived off from the cost of education($3600-$1000= $2600) and this remaining fee of $2600 can be paid in two installments. The first part of $1300 within 3 days after your arrival here in India and the remaining $1300 will be due in December 2024, or before your second semester begins.
30/1/24, 12:53 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: The registration fee can be paid either in two equal parts(The first half within 15 days and the second half within 30 days) or in one go itself.

Are you clear with the details?
30/1/24, 12:54 PM - +263 71 759 7158: Understand
30/1/24, 12:54 PM - +263 71 759 7158: Yes l am clear
30/1/24, 12:55 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Do you have any questions for me as of now?
30/1/24, 12:55 PM - +263 71 759 7158: No l dont
30/1/24, 12:56 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Noted,  It is really crucial to reserve your University seat with the completion of the registration fees. So I have made a special request to our Academic Board and a recommendation for you to be reconsidered at the earliest. May I know, how far is your family prepared towards the University registration fee as of now?
30/1/24, 12:56 PM - +263 71 759 7158: I haven't talked to them about it
30/1/24, 12:57 PM - +263 71 759 7158: The offer letter may come this month or ?
30/1/24, 1:00 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Noted Karen
30/1/24, 1:01 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Yes, you can expect it  this week itself if everything goes well
30/1/24, 1:01 PM - +263 71 759 7158: Okay okay understood
30/1/24, 1:08 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: I understand that you are interested in this golden opportunity to study in India under the given Scholarship. I do realize that your Family Members may have other concerns and this is the reason I have requested our Program Director Mr. Abhinav to spare some time to talk to your Parents about this. Is your parent available to share the schedule?
6/2/24, 3:53 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Good Day, Karen!
Please share the following documents with us as they are required for your university application preparation:

*1. A-Level Result/Letter of Recommendation/Statement of Entry (A-Level).*
