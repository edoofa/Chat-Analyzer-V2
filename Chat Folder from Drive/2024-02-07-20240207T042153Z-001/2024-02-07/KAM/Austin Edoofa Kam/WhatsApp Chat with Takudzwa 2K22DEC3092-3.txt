This transition marks a significant chapter in my life as I will be bidding farewell to the cherished moments at the Admissions Team in Edoofa.

Over the past year, having the privilege of supporting numerous students, including you, in your pursuit of higher education has been truly rewarding. Witnessing our students thrive and excel in their dream universities and colleges has brought immense satisfaction.

8/1/24, 1:52 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Takudzwa,

I am *Ms. Siddhi Singh, Admission Officer at Edoofa* and I am honoured to assume the responsibilities previously held by Mr. Shivjeet. I will be guiding you toward realising your dream education with Edoofa. I am confident that together, we can ensure a promising start to your educational journey, leading to the right employment opportunities and ultimately, success for you and your family.
8/1/24, 1:52 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: In the past few days, I had an in-depth discussion with Mr. Shivjeet and had the opportunity to review your scholarship application file in our records. Through this process, I gained valuable insights into your dreams and aspirations to advance your academic career. Upon reviewing your application file, I was both impressed and reassured to assist you in achieving these goals here in India, which will unlock doors to incredible opportunities in the future.
8/1/24, 1:52 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Before we get into the specifics of your admission journey and talk about your admission process, I would like to share an exciting milestone that India as a country achieved within the first week of 2024 – the successful *India's Chandrayaan-3 Engine Test.* This accomplishment is responsible for the third lunar mission, aiming to land a rover on the Moon's south polar region and conduct scientific studies that could check Moon's viability to sustain life. It signifies a significant scientific advancement, laying the groundwork for future progress.
8/1/24, 1:52 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This achievement has not only pushed boundaries but also has inspired young minds all over the world to pursue their dreams. On the same note, I wanted to extend my heartiest wishes for the New Year to you and your family and check in to see how you and your family started your year?
16/1/24, 7:18 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Takudzwa,

I trust this message finds you well, and I hope you are in high spirits. I was hoping to get a response from your end following my previous messages. However, in recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their A-Level results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey.
16/1/24, 7:18 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?
30/1/24, 2:52 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Greetings dear parent and Takudzwa
*I am Mr Austin, Senior Career Counsellor at Edoofa*
I hope you all are doing well

If you recall, I hosted your counselling and evaluation sessions, and you made me proud by qualifying for our prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program. I received results from all my students, happy and exhilarating with joy. Recalling our interaction together after a frantic search for your name I ended up messaging you today. I understand your calibre and had a discussion with the Admissions Head and have decided to *personally look after your admission process so that we can proceed with your application on priority through the best possible opportunities and exposures.*

Hence, I request you to come online and notify on this platform so that I can guide you ahead.
30/1/24, 3:07 PM - +263 71 298 7788: A very long time, Austin.
How are you
30/1/24, 3:12 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Indeed, Mr Chitemere!

30/1/24, 3:13 PM - +263 71 298 7788: We are fine this side
30/1/24, 3:19 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Good to hear that!
I will be guiding you further through the proceedings but just before that can you add Mrs Chitemere to this group
30/1/24, 3:19 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Also, Is Takudzwa also a part of this group?
30/1/24, 4:10 PM - +263 71 298 7788: Takudzwa is in the group

30/1/24, 4:23 PM - +263 71 298 7788: Thank you
30/1/24, 4:25 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: At the same time, I was going through your Admissions Group and was shocked to see that you are yet to complete the University registration process being a bright student and I still remember Takudzwa's passion for career and goals.. I personally had a discussion with the Admissions Head and have decided to help you in the best possible way as I understand Takudzwa's calibre.  

For that, can you please send the A level result
30/1/24, 4:27 PM - +263 71 298 7788: <Media omitted>

30/1/24, 4:28 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Thank you for sending!
30/1/24, 4:28 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Do you know we at EDOOFA received 2000 Applications in a Single Day just a week before and each day since then we are receiving not less than 1000 Applications each day from students seeking Scholarship? We were overwhelmed and had to reject more applications because of limited seats however were surely intrigued to know the reasons for such an immediate upsurge. Having conversations with my other students who are already preparing to arrive in India under the Edoofa Scholarship shared some mind-boggling Screenshots from the Fee Prospectus of the Universities in Zimbabwe.

*I am sure you and your family must have also discussed this,*. So what have you decided for your future ahead?
30/1/24, 4:34 PM - +263 71 298 7788: Takudzwa is on which percentage on his scholarship
30/1/24, 4:46 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: The exact percentage and tuition fees will be mentioned on the Offer Letter that Takudzwa will receive

31/1/24, 11:06 AM - +263 71 298 7788: Let us discuss
31/1/24, 11:08 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Sure
31/1/24, 11:08 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
31/1/24, 11:10 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
31/1/24, 11:10 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: *Let me share with you that all students who are in India have gone through what your child might be experiencing now. There was a stage of uncertainty and confusion where we guided them as Career Counsellors to ensure our learners fulfill their aspirations!*

I am proud to inform that the following 10 Students from *St Anthony's High* arrived here for the previous intake and some of them are preparing to arrive this year. I understand that we all have challenges in life and as your Career Counselor I am empathetic. 

*Mubika Tafadzwa*
*Lisford T Machingambi*
*Takudzwanashe Cherida*
*Austin Simbarashe Siwela*
*Pamella Tizirai*
*Tinotenda Musvamhuri*
*Kimberly Kudzai Regedzai*
*Mufaro Ruth Manjombo*
*Shalom Chinondiwana*
*Nashville Chivanga*
Do you know them as Takudzwa's seniors?
31/1/24, 11:47 AM - +263 71 298 7788: Ooh yes
31/1/24, 11:58 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Being a career counsellor, my aspirations for young learners like your child is similar. I firmly believe higher education should combine the following for a learner to achieve their goals:-

Quality Education
Conducive Environment
Critical Thinking and Practical learning skills
Technological Literacy and Attachments
Cultural Awareness and Global Perspective
Career guidance, Mentorships, etc.

*However, not everyone achieves success. Do you know why*?
31/1/24, 12:07 PM - +263 71 298 7788: May you kindly explain
31/1/24, 12:20 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
31/1/24, 12:20 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Therefore, It is important to know the facts of Edoofa's guidance and uniqueness compared to the normal University approach.

1) *Personalized mentorship and guidance throughout your course:-* As your Career Counsellor, I have known you since the beginning of the process, understanding your interests, aspirations, family background and plans for your career, unlike a University officer who may come across your application for the first time and treats with the same importance like others. I personally understand where you come from and what is required for you to be successful.
31/1/24, 12:20 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
31/1/24, 12:20 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: 3) *Financial Support and Planning:-* With a flexible payment plan for registration fees spreading across 45 days, the remaining cost of education can be paid in two installments. Students are ensured to open Indian bank accounts so that parents can even deposit the fees in monthly installments.

31/1/24, 12:21 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
31/1/24, 12:21 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: These are aspects that no other organization or University possesses as of now, I hope you are looking forward to such an opportunity for your child's career, aren't you?
31/1/24, 12:26 PM - +263 77 239 7498: Oh yes
31/1/24, 12:30 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Perfect, To confirm our records: the course Takudzwa selected for higher education is Bachelor of Technology in Biomedical Engineering and the intake is in August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information is accurate?
31/1/24, 12:30 PM - +263 71 298 7788: Very correct
31/1/24, 12:31 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: As I have promised, the Edoofa Admissions team will be submitting your application to multiple universities that will evaluate your application and upon being eligible, you receive the offer letters with comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. *I will guide you to the best education institution/university associated with us that aligns with your vision and interest and would provide you with a conducive environment for your holistic development and to fulfil your career goals.*

Upon receiving the Offer Letter, you will have a few weeks to pay a portion of your university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. We discussed the registration fee during our counselling sessions. May I know, what do you recall about the same now?
31/1/24, 12:33 PM - +263 71 298 7788: You are talking to a parent. Surely, l can not remember.
31/1/24, 12:35 PM - +263 77 239 7498: I have a question Austin
31/1/24, 12:36 PM - +263 77 239 7498: After completion of his degree, do you offer him a job that side
31/1/24, 12:36 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Let me help you with the same. *Usually, the registration fee is an additional fee apart from the cost of education but Edoofians receive an exclusive benefit where it is a part of the cost of education itself.* Let me give you an example:-
31/1/24, 12:36 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: As we discussed in the counseling session, the cost of education in India ranges from $6000-$8000 per annum which is reduced to $2700-$3700 per annum through the Edoofa Scholarship Program which includes the registration fee, remaining tuition fees, Accommodation, Food, Wifi, Laundry, library fee etc. Now, let us assume,

1. Tuition Fee: $2600 per annum
2. Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Total Fee: Tuition Fee $2600 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $3600 per annum
3. Registration Fee to be paid: $1000
31/1/24, 12:37 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: This means this registration fee will be waived off from the cost of education($3600-$1000= $2600) and this remaining fee of $2600 can be paid in two installments. The first part of $1300 within 3 days after your arrival here in India and the remaining $1300 will be due in December 2024, or before your second semester begins.
31/1/24, 12:37 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: The registration fee can be paid either in two equal parts(The first half within 15 days and the second half within 30 days) or in one go itself.

Are you clear with the details?
31/1/24, 12:38 PM - +263 77 239 7498: Very clear
31/1/24, 12:39 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: We are still working on the employability opportunities of Edoofians after graduation. At the same time, we are preparing students throughout the course and through the Earn While You Learn Program so that they gain employability skills and get transformed into employable and professionals of the era! They will be working on different platforms which will enhance their communication, leadership, team management and other professional skills.  Once they complete they are already having hands-on experience on various projects and real-life situations and it would be much easier for them to be employable and receive jobs internationally as our degrees are globally accredited.
31/1/24, 12:39 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Do you have any questions for me as of now?
31/1/24, 12:42 PM - +263 77 239 7498: No
31/1/24, 12:46 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Noted, I understand that you are interested in this golden opportunity for your child to study in India under the given Scholarship. Since this is a very important decision for Takudzwa's career, I have requested our Program Director Mr. Abhinav to spare some time to talk to your parent, address concerns if any and finalise the University registration process. Are you available for the same? <This message was edited>
