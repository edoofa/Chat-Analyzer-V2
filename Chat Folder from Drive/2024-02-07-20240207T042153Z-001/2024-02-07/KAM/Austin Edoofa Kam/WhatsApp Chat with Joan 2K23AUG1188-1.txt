16/1/24, 12:05 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Joan,

I trust this message finds you well, and I hope you are in high spirits. In recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their A-Level results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey.
16/1/24, 12:05 PM - Ashi Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?
30/1/24, 9:35 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Greetings dear parents and Joan, 
*I am Mr Austin, Senior Career Counsellor at Edoofa*
I hope you all are doing well

If you recall, I hosted your counselling and evaluation sessions, and you made me proud by qualifying for our prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program. I received results from all my students, happy and exhilarating with joy. Recalling our interaction together after a frantic search for your name I ended up messaging you today. I understand your calibre and had a discussion with the Admissions Head and have decided to *personally look after your admission process so that we can proceed with your application on priority through the best possible opportunities and exposures with affordability.*

Hence, I request you to come online *at 8:30 am CAT tomorrow (31/01/2024)* and notify on this platform so that I can guide you ahead.
30/1/24, 10:29 PM - +27 69 343 5587: Goodday 
I will not be able to pay the remaining $750 due to financial issues but I would like to thank you for the opportunity you had given me

31/1/24, 8:49 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Good Morning to you all! 

How are you today?
31/1/24, 8:49 AM - +27 69 343 5587: Goodmorning
31/1/24, 8:55 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Good to hear from Joan!
How are you doing?
31/1/24, 8:56 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: I do understand the financial challenges and I had discussions with our Academic Officer regarding the same. Considering the scenario, how are you planning to proceed ahead with your higher education?
31/1/24, 8:59 AM - +27 69 343 5587: As of now everything is on stand still and I have no plan whatso
31/1/24, 8:59 AM - +27 69 343 5587: *whatsoever
31/1/24, 9:14 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: I get the challenges and your current position
31/1/24, 9:15 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Apart from the finances, do you have any other challenges?
31/1/24, 9:56 AM - +27 69 343 5587: Not really
31/1/24, 10:03 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Noted Joan, Considering the financial situation, I have made a special recommendation for you for a scholarship on tuition fees up to 100% and even a sponsorship on Accommodation. At Edoofa, we ensure that Edoofians receive the best opportunities with affordability if you are genuinely deserving. So shall I help you with the way forward?
31/1/24, 10:04 AM - +27 69 343 5587: Yes please and thank you very much
31/1/24, 10:04 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: You are welcome, Joan!
31/1/24, 10:04 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
31/1/24, 10:05 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
31/1/24, 10:06 AM - +27 69 343 5587: Thats very nice
31/1/24, 10:09 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Indeed Joan, Being a career counsellor, my aspirations for young learners like you are similar. I firmly believe higher education should combine the following for a learner to achieve their goals:-

Quality Education
Conducive Environment
Critical Thinking and Practical learning skills
Technological Literacy and Attachments
Cultural Awareness and Global Perspective
Career guidance, Mentorships, etc.

*However, not everyone achieves success. Do you know why*?
31/1/24, 10:12 AM - +27 69 343 5587: Because not everyone gets the opportunity
31/1/24, 10:12 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: That is indeed a reason!
31/1/24, 10:13 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Therefore, It is important to know the facts of Edoofa's guidance and uniqueness compared to the normal University approach.

1) *Personalized mentorship and guidance throughout your course:-* As your Career Counsellor, I have known you since the beginning of the process, understanding your interests, aspirations, family background and plans for your career, unlike a University officer who may come across your application for the first time and treats with the same importance like others. I personally understand where you come from and what is required for you to be successful.
31/1/24, 10:13 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
31/1/24, 10:13 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: 3) *Financial Support and Planning:-* With a flexible payment plan for registration fees spreading across 45 days, the remaining cost of education can be paid in two installments. Students are ensured to open Indian bank accounts so that parents can even deposit the fees in monthly installments.
31/1/24, 10:13 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
31/1/24, 10:13 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
31/1/24, 10:13 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: These are aspects that no other organization or University possesses as of now, I hope you are looking forward to such an opportunity for your career, aren't you?
31/1/24, 10:15 AM - +27 69 343 5587: Yes I definitely am
31/1/24, 10:16 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: That is great to hear, Joan!
31/1/24, 10:16 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is Bachelor of Arts-Bachelor of Legislative Law and your intake is in August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information is accurate?
31/1/24, 10:34 AM - +27 69 343 5587: Yes it is correct
31/1/24, 10:36 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: As I have promised, the Edoofa Admissions team will be submitting your application to multiple universities that will evaluate your application and upon being eligible, you receive the offer letters with comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. *I will guide you to the best education institution/university associated with us that aligns with your vision and interest and would provide you with a conducive environment for your holistic development and to fulfil your career goals.*

Upon receiving the Offer Letter, you will have a few weeks to pay a portion of your university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. We discussed the registration fee during our counselling sessions. May I know, what do you recall about the same now?
31/1/24, 10:37 AM - +27 69 343 5587: The $750 for the registration
31/1/24, 10:39 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Noted and let me help you with a better understanding. *Usually, the registration fee is an additional fee apart from the cost of education but Edoofians receive an exclusive benefit where it is a part of the cost of education itself.* Let me give you an example:-
31/1/24, 10:39 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: As we discussed in the counseling session, the cost of education in India ranges from $6000-$8000 per annum which is reduced to $1200-$1800 per annum through the Edoofa Scholarship Program *as we will recommend your application for a higher quantum of scholarship.* Congratulations on the same. Now, let us assume,
31/1/24, 10:39 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: 1. *Tuition Fee*: $650 per annum
2. *Accommodation Fee*: $0 per annum (100% Sponsorship)
3. *Remaining Fee Components*: [Library Fee, Examination Fee, EDB and Book Bank, International Student Development Fund, 24-Hour WiFi Cost, Maintenance Fee, Water Bill, and Electricity Bill]: $1000 per annum

*Total Fee: Tuition Fee $650 + Accommodation Fee $0 + Remaining Fee Components $1000 = $1650 per annum.*

4. *Registration Fee to be paid:* $1000
31/1/24, 10:39 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: This means this registration fee will be waived off from the cost of education ($1650-$1000= $650) and this remaining fee of $650 is supposed to be paid within 3 days of arrival.
31/1/24, 10:40 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: The registration fee can be paid either in two equal parts(The first half within 15 days and the second half within 30 days) or in one go itself.

Are you clear with the details?
31/1/24, 10:40 AM - +27 69 343 5587: Yes we are
31/1/24, 10:41 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Do you have any questions for me as of now?
31/1/24, 10:42 AM - +27 69 343 5587: It is not a question but as of now things are really tight and the $650 we do not have
31/1/24, 10:45 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: That is understandable Joan and our Admissions Team also informed me about the challenge!
So, how much time will your family require to raise the registration fees?
31/1/24, 10:48 AM - +27 69 343 5587: Im not sure honestly
31/1/24, 10:48 AM - +27 69 343 5587: I'll have to communicate with you once we have it
31/1/24, 10:52 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: That is alright, Joan!
31/1/24, 10:56 AM - +27 69 343 5587: Thank you
31/1/24, 11:01 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: You are welcome, Joan, I understand that you are interested in this golden opportunity to study in India under the given Scholarship. I do realize that your Family Members may have other concerns and the need for a feasible payment plan.
