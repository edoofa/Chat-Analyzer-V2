26/12/23, 7:21 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I trust this message reaches you in good health. I had been anticipating a response from you, but it seems my previous messages may have gone unnoticed for quite some time now. I can also see that you have seen my messages. This has raised some concerns on my part, which is affecting your scholarship application. As we have already mentioned before, we will be proceeding with your admission process after *August 2023*. It has already been 4 months now.

I understand that there might be challenges regarding this. Even the holidays are just around the corner as well. Hence, if you're ready now, please let me know so that we can proceed with the session, or let me know if you are facing any challenges so that we can discuss this better. <This message was edited>
26/12/23, 7:32 PM - +263 77 355 1079: Hello Sir 
We are fine. I think it's because of some pressure at work. I hope you will accept my apology Sir Shivjeet
27/12/23, 2:45 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, dear parents and Kudzai

It is alright. How are you doing today?
6/1/24, 3:58 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, Parents of Kudzai,

I am *Mr. Shivjeet, and I serve as the Admission Officer at Edoofa.* I wanted to extend my heartfelt wishes to you and your family for a prosperous and fulfilling 2024. 

I firmly believe that with the commencement of this new year, comes the promise of fresh beginnings, guiding the way for the actualization of one's deepest dreams and aspirations. As we stand on the threshold of this promising year, I am filled with excitement for the adventures it holds.
6/1/24, 3:58 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: In the same spirit, I would like to share that I am embarking on a journey as I prepare myself to pursue my doctorate and take a step forward in my academic pursuits. This transition marks a significant chapter in my life as I will be bidding farewell to the cherished moments at the Admissions Team in Edoofa.

Over the past year, having the privilege of supporting numerous students, including you, in your pursuit of higher education has been truly rewarding. Witnessing our students thrive and excel in their dream universities and colleges has brought immense satisfaction.
6/1/24, 3:58 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: The decision to transition to a new phase in my life presents an incredible opportunity for me to continue contributing to the lives of students, ensuring their academic journey and overall experience remain enriched and fulfilling.

As I embark on this new journey, I want to assure you that I have entrusted your application file to capable hands. From this point forward, your admission journey will be seamlessly guided by one of our accomplished admission officers, *Ms. Siddhi,* who will connect with you on Tuesday.  I hope you will make yourself available for further procedures and will give your best to your career.
6/1/24, 3:58 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I extend my heartfelt wishes for your continued success and a bright future filled with educational accomplishments. Wish you all the best, and God Bless.

Mr. Shiveet

Waal that's a great achievement in your life Sir. Wishing you all the best in your studies.
I also wish to reach the doctorate level 😊
Thank you for being our Admissions officer. I would have loved it if you had bid a farewell after my son had reached India 😊but anyway thank you so much Sir,as a family we really appreciate.
8/1/24, 2:02 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Kudzai,

I am *Ms. Siddhi Singh, Admission Officer at Edoofa* and I am honoured to assume the responsibilities previously held by Mr. Shivjeet. I will be guiding you toward realising your dream education with Edoofa. I am confident that together, we can ensure a promising start to your educational journey, leading to the right employment opportunities and ultimately, success for you and your family.
8/1/24, 2:02 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: In the past few days, I had an in-depth discussion with Mr. Shivjeet and had the opportunity to review your scholarship application file in our records. Through this process, I gained valuable insights into your dreams and aspirations to advance your academic career. Upon reviewing your application file, I was both impressed and reassured to assist you in achieving these goals here in India, which will unlock doors to incredible opportunities in the future.
8/1/24, 2:02 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Before we get into the specifics of your admission journey and talk about your admission process, I would like to share an exciting milestone that India as a country achieved within the first week of 2024 – the successful *India's Chandrayaan-3 Engine Test.* This accomplishment is responsible for the third lunar mission, aiming to land a rover on the Moon's south polar region and conduct scientific studies that could check Moon's viability to sustain life. It signifies a significant scientific advancement, laying the groundwork for future progress.
8/1/24, 2:02 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This achievement has not only pushed boundaries but also has inspired young minds all over the world to pursue their dreams. On the same note, I wanted to extend my heartiest wishes for the New Year to you and your family and check in to see how you and your family started your year?
16/1/24, 7:17 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Kudzai,

I trust this message finds you well, and I hope you are in high spirits. I was hoping to get a response from your end following my previous messages. However, in recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their A-Level results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey.
16/1/24, 7:17 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?
16/1/24, 7:23 PM - +263 77 293 7003: <Media omitted>
16/1/24, 7:24 PM - +263 77 293 7003: Thank you I'm Kudzai 's Dad I'm pleased  to let you know that Kudzai obtained 14points from his Alevel exams
17/1/24, 9:21 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Kudzai.

Thank you for sharing your results, and congratulations on successfully clearing all your A-Level subjects! Your hard work over the past few months has truly paid off.

I am sure your family is immensely proud of your achievements. Your A-level results have been duly noted, and we will quickly add them to your scholarship application. This will enable us to engage in discussions with the academic board and chart the best course of action for your next steps.
17/1/24, 9:21 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Kindly allow us some time to thoroughly evaluate your results and plan the way forward. Once we have re-evaluated your application, along with all the other applications, we will reconnect with you to discuss the next steps in your academic journey.
22/1/24, 11:24 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Greetings Kudzai,
*I am Mr Austin, Senior Career Counsellor at Edoofa*
I hope you all are doing well

If you recall, I hosted your counselling and evaluation sessions, and you made me proud by qualifying for our prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program. I received results from all my students, happy and exhilarating with joy. Recalling our interaction together after a frantic search for your name I ended up messaging you today. I understand your calibre and had a discussion with the Admissions Head and have decided to *personally look after your admission process so that we can proceed with your application on priority through the best possible opportunities and exposures.*

Hence, I request you to come online at *11:30 am CAT tomorrow* and notify on this platform so that I can guide you ahead.
23/1/24, 11:48 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Good Day dear parent and Kudzai

Are you ready to begin?

I trust I find you in good health

After a close evaluation of your application with my special recommendation considering the aspirations and skills of Kudzai, we have considered your application for *upto a 100% scholarship on tuition fees and full sponsorship on Accommodation*. Congratulations on this exemplary opportunity. At the same time, we would need you to be online at *8:30 am CAT tomorrow* to discuss the same in detail and further proceedings. Let us connect then and in the case of any challenges, do feel free to inform me. <This message was edited>

6/2/24, 9:11 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Good Day dear parents and Kudzai!

I got a bit tied up with sessions and plans for our Africa trip due to which I was unable to get back to you, please excuse me for the same.

6/2/24, 10:00 AM - +263 77 852 6516: Ok wow that's nice
6/2/24, 10:02 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: *Congratulations on your exemplary A-level results* At the same time, I was going through your Admissions Group and was shocked to see that you are yet to complete the University registration process being a bright student and I still remember your passion for career and goals, making you one of my favourite students.


So, are you well available to begin the session?
6/2/24, 10:03 AM - +263 77 852 6516: Thank you sir😊yes I am available for the session
6/2/24, 10:13 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: You are welcome, Kudzai
6/2/24, 10:13 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: At the same time, do you know we at EDOOFA received 2000 Applications in a Single Day just a week before and each day since then we are receiving not less than 1000 Applications each day from students seeking Scholarship? We were overwhelmed and had to reject more applications because of limited seats however were surely intrigued to know the reasons for such an immediate upsurge. Having conversations with my other students who are already preparing to arrive in India under the Edoofa Scholarship shared some mind-boggling Screenshots from the Fee Prospectus of the Universities in Zimbabwe.

6/2/24, 10:13 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: I am shocked to compile these data for the Fee Structures of some famous Public Universities in Zimbabwe.

*Bindura University of Science Education (BUSE)* -https://www.buse.ac.zw/fees-structure/ - *($680 per term)*

*Chinhoyi University of Technology (CUT)* https://www.cut.ac.zw/welcome/assets/files/fees-structure/School%20of%20Engineering%20Science.pdf - *($535 per term)*

*University of Zimbabwe (UZ)* -https://www.uz.ac.zw/index.php/faculties/160-fac-of-medicine/med-deparrtments/305-med-dpt-of-comm *($523 per term)*

NUST -*($870 per term)*

*I am sure you and your family must have also discussed this,*. So what have you decided for your future ahead?
6/2/24, 10:16 AM - +263 77 852 6516: Yes we discussed about it...we have decided that I will study abroad
6/2/24, 10:18 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: This is well noted, Kudzai!

6/2/24, 10:23 AM - +263 77 852 6516: Wow..so many people from here and I can notice a few faces
6/2/24, 10:24 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: That is great!
6/2/24, 10:24 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Being a career counsellor, my aspirations for young learners like you are similar. I firmly believe higher education should combine the following for a learner to achieve their goals:-

Quality Education
Conducive Environment
Critical Thinking and Practical learning skills
Technological Literacy and Attachments
Cultural Awareness and Global Perspective
Career guidance, Mentorships, etc.

*However, not everyone achieves success. Do you know why*?
6/2/24, 10:31 AM - +263 77 852 6516: No I don't really know why
6/2/24, 10:44 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
6/2/24, 10:44 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Therefore, It is important to know the facts of Edoofa's guidance and uniqueness compared to the normal University approach.

1) *Personalized mentorship and guidance throughout your course:-* As your Career Counsellor, I have known you since the beginning of the process, understanding your interests, aspirations, family background and plans for your career, unlike a University officer who may come across your application for the first time and treats with the same importance like others. I personally understand where you come from and what is required for you to be successful.
6/2/24, 10:44 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
6/2/24, 10:44 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: 3) *Financial Support and Planning:-* With a flexible payment plan for registration fees spreading across 45 days, the remaining cost of education can be paid in two installments. Students are ensured to open Indian bank accounts so that parents can even deposit the fees in monthly installments.

6/2/24, 10:44 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
6/2/24, 10:44 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: These are aspects that no other organization or University possesses as of now, I hope you are looking forward to such an opportunity for your career, aren't you?
6/2/24, 10:52 AM - +263 77 852 6516: I am looking forward to it😊
6/2/24, 10:55 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Perfect, To confirm our records: can you please tell me the name of your course and intake
6/2/24, 10:56 AM - +263 77 852 6516: Bachelor of business Administration Information Technology
6/2/24, 10:56 AM - +263 77 852 6516: August intake
6/2/24, 11:09 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Kudzai, I was going through your profile, 
I believe you are still aspiring to become a Systems Engineer, right?
6/2/24, 11:17 AM - +263 77 852 6516: Yes sir
6/2/24, 11:30 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Noted Kudzai, In this case the most apt course aligned with your aspiration would be Bachelor of Computer Applications(BCA) for which I can also recommend your application for a higher quantum of scholarship
6/2/24, 11:31 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Network Systems is a part of the course and will help you proceed specifically to this course
6/2/24, 11:47 AM - +263 77 852 6516: Ok sir..that's good
6/2/24, 11:48 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Indeed Kudzai
As I have promised, the Edoofa Admissions team will be submitting your application to multiple universities that will evaluate your application and upon being eligible, you receive the offer letters with comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. *I will guide you to the best education institution/university associated with us that aligns with your vision and interest and would provide you with a conducive environment for your holistic development and to fulfil your career goals.*

Upon receiving the Offer Letter, you will have a few weeks to pay a portion of your university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. We discussed the registration fee during our counselling sessions. May I know, what do you recall about the same now?
6/2/24, 11:51 AM - +263 77 852 6516: Sorry sir but it seems like I cannot recall since it's been long
6/2/24, 11:52 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Let me help you with the understanding. *Usually, the registration fee is an additional fee apart from the cost of education but Edoofians receive an exclusive benefit where it is a part of the cost of education itself.* Let me give you an example:-
6/2/24, 11:53 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: As we discussed in the counseling session, the cost of education in India ranges from $6000-$8000 per annum which is reduced to $1200-$1800 per annum through the Edoofa Scholarship Program *as I will be recommending your application for a higher quantum of scholarship.* Congratulations on the same. Now, let us assume,
6/2/24, 11:53 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: 1. *Tuition Fee*: $650 per annum
2. *Accommodation Fee*: $0 per annum (100% Sponsorship)
3. *Remaining Fee Components*: [Library Fee, Examination Fee, EDB and Book Bank, International Student Development Fund, 24-Hour WiFi Cost, Maintenance Fee, Water Bill, and Electricity Bill]: $1000 per annum

*Total Fee: Tuition Fee $650 + Accommodation Fee $0 + Remaining Fee Components $1000 = $1650 per annum.*

4. *Registration Fee to be paid:* $1000
6/2/24, 11:53 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: This means this registration fee will be waived off from the cost of education ($1650-$1000= $650) and this remaining fee of $650 is supposed to be paid within 3 days of arrival.
6/2/24, 11:53 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: The registration fee can be paid either in two equal parts(The first half within 15 days and the second half within 30 days) or in one go itself.

Are you clear with the details?
6/2/24, 11:56 AM - +263 77 852 6516: Yes sir.its now clear
6/2/24, 11:56 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Great, do you have any questions for me?
6/2/24, 11:59 AM - +263 77 852 6516: No.i don't have any questions for now since you answered all of them in our call
6/2/24, 12:01 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Noted Kudzai,  It is really crucial to reserve your University seat with the completion of the registration fees. So I have made a special request to our Academic Board and a recommendation for you to be reconsidered at the earliest. May I know, how far is your family prepared towards the University registration fee as of now?
6/2/24, 12:02 PM - +263 77 852 6516: They are well prepared
6/2/24, 12:04 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: This is well noted, Kudzai
6/2/24, 12:04 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Please share the following documents with us as they are required for your university application preparation:

*1. A-Level Result/Letter of Recommendation/Statement of Entry (A-Level).*

*2. O-Level Results*

*3. Identity proof (International Traveling Passport or National ID or Birth Certificate)*
