16/1/24, 11:20 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Raymond,

I trust this message finds you well, and I hope you are in high spirits. In recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their A-Level results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey. <This message was edited>
16/1/24, 11:22 AM - Ashi Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?

22/1/24, 2:37 PM - Keshav Edoofa: Good Day, Raymond
I hope you all are doing well

If you recall, I am your Senior Career Counsellor at Edoofa and hosted your counselling and evaluation sessions, and you made me proud by qualifying for our prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program. I received results from all my students, happy and exhilarating with joy. Recalling our interaction, I remembered that during our session you portrayed an enormous potential of becoming a leader of tomorrow. Hence I have asked my Colleague *Mr Austin, Senior Academician* to personally look after your admission process so that we can proceed with your application on priority. 

Hence I request you to come online, notify on this group and continue with your admission procedures.

3/2/24, 9:04 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: At the same time, I was going through your Admissions Group and was shocked to see that you weren't able to complete the University registration process being a bright student and I still remember your passion for career and goals, making you one of my favourite students. I personally had a discussion with the Admissions Head and have decided to help you in the best possible way as I understand your calibre.  So, are you actively available for the session?
3/2/24, 9:04 AM - +263 78 559 6271: Am ready sir lets carry on
3/2/24, 9:05 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Great, do you know we at EDOOFA received 2000 Applications in a Single Day just a week before and each day since then we are receiving not less than 1000 Applications each day from students seeking Scholarship? We were overwhelmed and had to reject more applications because of limited seats however were surely intrigued to know the reasons for such an immediate upsurge. Having conversations with my other students who are already preparing to arrive in India under the Edoofa Scholarship shared some mind-boggling Screenshots from the Fee Prospectus of the Universities in Zimbabwe.

*I am sure you and your family must have also discussed this,*. So what have you decided for your future ahead?
3/2/24, 9:09 AM - +263 78 559 6271: I had no vision of going to any of the universities above
3/2/24, 9:16 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: I can understand and let me guide you through the best opportunities, Raymond!

3/2/24, 9:38 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Being a career counsellor, my aspirations for young learners like you are similar. I firmly believe higher education should combine the following for a learner to achieve their goals:-

Quality Education
Conducive Environment
Critical Thinking and Practical learning skills
Technological Literacy and Attachments
Cultural Awareness and Global Perspective
Career guidance, Mentorships, etc.

*However, not everyone achieves success. Do you know why*?
3/2/24, 9:39 AM - +263 78 559 6271: Why sir
3/2/24, 9:43 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
3/2/24, 9:43 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Therefore, It is important to know the facts of Edoofa's guidance and uniqueness compared to the normal University approach.

1) *Personalized mentorship and guidance throughout your course:-* As your Career Counsellor, I have known you since the beginning of the process, understanding your interests, aspirations, family background and plans for your career, unlike a University officer who may come across your application for the first time and treats with the same importance like others. I personally understand where you come from and what is required for you to be successful.
3/2/24, 9:43 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
3/2/24, 9:43 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: 3) *Financial Support and Planning:-* With a flexible payment plan for registration fees spreading across 45 days, the remaining cost of education can be paid in two installments. Students are ensured to open Indian bank accounts so that parents can even deposit the fees in monthly installments.

5/2/24, 9:58 AM - +263 78 559 6271: Yea Its really great thanks for the explanation l like it
5/2/24, 10:05 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: You are welcome, do you have any question for me regarding the course?
5/2/24, 10:06 AM - +263 78 559 6271: Well understood so you meant basing on my O level results l can take this path? <This message was edited>
5/2/24, 10:14 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Absolutely, Raymond!
5/2/24, 10:14 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: As I have promised, the Edoofa Admissions team will be submitting your application to multiple universities that will evaluate your application and upon being eligible, you receive the offer letters with comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. *I will guide you to the best education institution/university associated with us that aligns with your vision and interest and would provide you with a conducive environment for your holistic development and to fulfil your career goals.*

Upon receiving the Offer Letter, you will have a few weeks to pay a portion of your university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. We discussed the registration fee during our counselling sessions. May I know, what do you recall about the same now?
5/2/24, 10:21 AM - +263 78 559 6271: <Media omitted>
5/2/24, 10:22 AM - +263 78 559 6271: Still remember this explained my Registration when l got a offer letter here
5/2/24, 10:27 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: That is good to know, Raymond!
5/2/24, 10:27 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: *Usually, the registration fee is an additional fee apart from the cost of education but Edoofians receive an exclusive benefit where it is a part of the cost of education itself.* Let me give you an example:-
5/2/24, 10:27 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: As we discussed in the counselling session, the cost of education in India ranges from $6000-$8000 per annum which is reduced to $2000-$3000 per annum through the Edoofa Scholarship Program which includes the registration fee, remaining tuition fees, Accommodation, Food, Wifi, Laundry, library fee etc. Now, let us assume,

1. *Tuition Fee*: $1800 per annum
2. *Food and Accommodation Fee*: $1000 per annum 
Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum
3. *Registration Fee to be paid:* $1000
5/2/24, 10:27 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: This means this registration fee that you pay will be subtracted from the cost of education ($2800-$1000= $1800) and the remaining fee of $1800 can be paid in two installments. The first part of $900 within 3 days after your arrival here in India and the remaining $900 will be due in December 2024, or before your second semester begins.
5/2/24, 10:27 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: The registration fee can be paid either in two equal parts(The first half within 15 days and the second half within 30 days) or in one go itself.

Are you clear with the details?
5/2/24, 10:30 AM - +263 78 559 6271: Yea we clear
5/2/24, 10:51 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Do you  have any questions for me as of now?
5/2/24, 11:07 AM - +263 78 559 6271: No sir
5/2/24, 11:08 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Noted,  It is really crucial to reserve your University seat with the completion of the registration fees. So I have made a special request to our Academic Board and a recommendation for you to be reconsidered at the earliest. May I know, how far is your family prepared towards the University registration fee as of now?
5/2/24, 4:19 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Dear parent, Please greet Mr Abhinav Gupta, Program Director at Edoofa in his inbox to begin the call regarding your child's application and further proceedings. Ensure to maintain a stable network for a video call and I wish you a fruitful discussion.
