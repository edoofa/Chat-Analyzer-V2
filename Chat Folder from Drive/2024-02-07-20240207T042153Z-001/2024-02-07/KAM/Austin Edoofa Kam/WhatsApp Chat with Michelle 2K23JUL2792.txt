16/1/24, 11:30 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Michelle,

I trust this message finds you well, and I hope you are in high spirits. In recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their MSCE results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey.
16/1/24, 11:31 AM - Kirti Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your MSCE results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your MSCE results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?
24/1/24, 9:25 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Greetings dear parents and Michelle
*I am Mr Austin, Senior Career Counsellor at Edoofa*
I hope you all are doing well

If you recall, I hosted your counselling and evaluation sessions, and you made me proud by qualifying for our prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program. I received results from all my students, happy and exhilarating with joy. Recalling our interaction together after a frantic search for your name I ended up messaging you today. I understand your calibre and had a discussion with the Admissions Head and have decided to *personally look after your admission process so that we can proceed with your application on priority through the best possible opportunities and exposures.*

Hence, I request you to come online at *12:00 pm CAT today* and notify on this platform so that I can guide you ahead.
24/1/24, 12:22 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Greetings to you all!
I am here to guide you through the further proceedings of the program and guide you ahead

Are you available to begin?
24/1/24, 12:32 PM - +265 882 05 59 00: Good afternoon, Sir.
Thank you for your time and efforts to offer us a better education, but there's something that wasn't made clear.

As a family, we discovered that the rates of fees offered to us by the schools, against the economy, would be hard for us to accomplish. So we decided to further my education through other means, and not by Edoofa. Just that in the last few discussions my parents may have not been thorough with that issue, but we decided we won't use Edoofa scholarship program anymore.

I hope this won't bring any inconvenience, as we are just trying to find better viable options because of the financial situation. We appreciate all the time and efforts you've spent on trying to give us high quality education.

Regards, Michelle.
24/1/24, 12:47 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Good to hear from you, Michelle!

24/1/24, 12:47 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: I have gone through the conversations in the group and am aware of the devaluation of Kwacha. I am in touch with many parents, students and educationists from Malawi due to which I am being updated about the happenings <This message was edited>
24/1/24, 12:47 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Therefore, I am here to guide you in the best and most feasible opportunities for your career
24/1/24, 12:51 PM - +265 882 05 59 00: For now I'm sure we're gonna be okay. For us, we'll just find something cheaper than what you're offering, there's no problem at all. But we appreciate your kindness, we do.
24/1/24, 12:52 PM - +265 882 05 59 00: Just that from here on out we'll be looking at other options, so we won't really need much help, thank you.
24/1/24, 1:29 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Michelle, I really understand your concerns and appreciate your good heart too. At the same time, after going through the discussions, I specially recommended your application for *a higher quantum of scholarship* at our associate institution affiliated to a public University in India which means you will be graduating with the certificate from a public university in India.

So, I put the recommendation against your application already considering the challenges your family has been facing which is beyond your control.
24/1/24, 1:30 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Now, we can either discontinue or if you wish to wait , that would also be fine
24/1/24, 1:31 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Moreover, apart from the same, Edoofians are being offered a lot more exposure than any other institution or organization. be it in terms of affordability or in employability.
24/1/24, 1:31 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Therefore, It is important to know the facts of Edoofa's guidance and uniqueness compared to the normal University approach.

1) *Personalized mentorship and guidance throughout your course:-* As your Career Counsellor, I have known you since the beginning of the process, understanding your interests, aspirations, family background and plans for your career, unlike a University officer who may come across your application for the first time and treats with the same importance like others. I personally understand where you come from and what is required for you to be successful.

24/1/24, 1:31 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: 3) *Financial Support and Planning:-* With a flexible payment plan for registration fees spreading across 45 days, the remaining cost of education can be paid in two installments. Students are ensured to open Indian bank accounts so that parents can even deposit the fees in monthly installments.

24/1/24, 1:40 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: These are aspects along with affordability that no other organization or University possesses as of now, I hope you are looking forward to such an opportunity for your career.
24/1/24, 1:43 PM - +265 882 05 59 00: That would be really nice, sounds good.
24/1/24, 1:45 PM - +265 882 05 59 00: May I know the process for the higher quantum of scholarship??
24/1/24, 1:46 PM - +265 882 05 59 00: Yes I'm aware
24/1/24, 1:53 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Indeed Michelle!
24/1/24, 1:54 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: After completing this short session, I will be arranging a call for your parents/parent after which the final feedback will be shared
24/1/24, 1:54 PM - +265 882 05 59 00: Alright alright

25/1/24, 9:31 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Good Morning to you all! 
How are you today?
25/1/24, 9:31 AM - +265 882 05 59 00: Good morning. Great, and you?
25/1/24, 9:34 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Good to hear that, I am doing well, Michelle
25/1/24, 9:36 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Since your higher education is a very important decision for your career, I have requested our Program Director Mr. Abhinav to spare some time to talk to your parent, address concerns if any and finalise the University registration process as I informed earlier. Shall I share  the schedule for the same?
25/1/24, 9:37 AM - +265 882 05 59 00: University registration for the higher quantum of scholarship??
25/1/24, 9:37 AM - +265 882 05 59 00: You haven't explained to me in detail what exactly is the process.
25/1/24, 9:40 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: That is correct Michelle!
25/1/24, 9:41 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: I have already shared your application with our Academic Board with a special recommendation. After this call, our Program Director has to finalise and approve. If everything goes well, you will then be receiving the Offer Letter from the institution with the details
25/1/24, 9:43 AM - +265 882 05 59 00: Alright. I'd like you to take note that if the offer won't be as appealing as I expect, I'll still recommend leaving Edoofa. Just a heads up.
25/1/24, 9:44 AM - +265 882 05 59 00: Because the name scholarship portrays the ease of access to education. So if it happens that I have to pay beyond my expectations I may not accept the offer letter.
25/1/24, 9:46 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: I understand Michelle, the final decision will be taken on the University and the exact percentage and details will be conveyed on the Offer letter.

At the same time, what are your expectations in terms of finances and others?
25/1/24, 9:48 AM - +265 882 05 59 00: Alright thank you.

From the previous offers, the best was about 750$ initial payment to settle for a seat at a university. That was a 50% scholarship. Anything better than that I'd consider.
25/1/24, 9:48 AM - +265 882 05 59 00: So let's just hope for the best.
25/1/24, 9:56 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Noted Michelle, at the same time, I see you also received an offer from MVN university for a 100% scholarship
25/1/24, 9:57 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Did you have any concern regarding the institution?
25/1/24, 9:58 AM - +265 882 05 59 00: Yes but the campus wasn't appealing enough
25/1/24, 10:00 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Would you like to explain the same for me please, Michelle as in why the campus wasn't appealing

This would help me gain a better understanding of your expectations
25/1/24, 10:01 AM - +265 882 05 59 00: Well the buildings were far apart. Looking at the view of the place didn't pull me to accept the offer. There's a lot of space they could put to good use, basically. It's basic, not intriguing.
25/1/24, 10:06 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: So, did you connect to any students for MVN to understand the life and experiences at campus?
25/1/24, 10:15 AM - +265 882 05 59 00: No I didn't, because as a family we were already considering leaving Edoofa. So there was no point in actual sense.
25/1/24, 10:25 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: I get the perspective Michelle, so shall I schedule the call for your parents at 6:15 pm CAT Today?
25/1/24, 10:34 AM - +265 882 05 59 00: There's an issue at home, we really can't be available for the rest of the week. So if we schedule the call for Monday afternoon that'll be okay.
25/1/24, 10:34 AM - +265 882 05 59 00: We can reconnect Monday morning.
25/1/24, 10:45 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Let me please check if the Program Director will be available on Monday and will revert to you
25/1/24, 10:45 AM - +265 882 05 59 00: Alright please do so.
25/1/24, 10:48 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Sure Michelle, is there anything that you would like to ask me as of now?
25/1/24, 12:01 PM - +265 882 05 59 00: No for now we're okay
