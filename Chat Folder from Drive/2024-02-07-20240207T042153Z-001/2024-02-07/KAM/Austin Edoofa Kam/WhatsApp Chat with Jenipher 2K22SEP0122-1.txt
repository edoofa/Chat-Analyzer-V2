12/1/24, 5:44 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Jenipher ,

I trust this message finds you in good health. As we step into the second week of January, I wanted to reach out and share an exciting milestone that India as a country achieved within the first week of 2024 - the successful India's Chandrayaan-3 Engine Test.
12/1/24, 5:44 PM - Kirti Edoofa: This accomplishment is responsible for the third lunar mission, aiming to land a rover on the Moon's south polar region and conduct scientific studies that could check Moon's viability to sustain life. It signifies a significant scientific advancement, laying the groundwork for future progress.
12/1/24, 5:44 PM - Kirti Edoofa: This achievement has not only pushed boundaries but also inspired young minds all over the world to pursue their dreams. On the same note, I wanted to extend my heartiest wishes for the New Year to you and your family and check in to see how you and your family started your year?
16/1/24, 12:05 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Proud Edoofians,

I trust this message finds you well, and I hope you are in high spirits. In recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their A-Level results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey.
16/1/24, 12:05 PM - Kirti Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?
2/2/24, 4:22 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Greetings dear parent, @263777893976 
I trust I find you in good health

After a close evaluation of your application with my special recommendation considering the aspirations and skills of Jenipher, we have considered your application for *upto a 100% scholarship on tuition fees and full sponsorship on Accommodation*.

We were overwhelmed and had to reject more applications because of limited seats however were surely intrigued to know the reasons for such an immediate upsurge. Having conversations with my other students who are already preparing to arrive in India under the Edoofa Scholarship shared some mind-boggling Screenshots from the Fee Prospectus of the Universities in Zimbabwe.

3/2/24, 8:53 AM - +263 77 789 3976: We wish for her to study there in India
3/2/24, 8:58 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: This is well noted and I will be guiding you forward!
3/2/24, 8:58 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
3/2/24, 8:59 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
3/2/24, 8:59 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: *Let me share with you that all students who are in India have gone through what you might be experiencing now. There was a stage of uncertainty and confusion where we guided them as Career Counsellors to ensure our learners fulfill their aspirations!*

The following Students from *Regina Mundi High* are already here in India and some of them are preparing to arrive this year. I understand that we all have challenges in life and as your Career Counselor I am empathetic. 

*Sithole Rutendo E*
*Miriam Mufaro Mavura*
*Dezyline Z Marara*
Do you know them as Jenipher's seniors?
3/2/24, 9:01 AM - +263 78 727 6897: How are you
3/2/24, 9:01 AM - +263 77 789 3976: Impressive
3/2/24, 9:01 AM - +263 78 727 6897: I am available for the discussion
3/2/24, 9:02 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: I am doing well, Jenipher!
3/2/24, 9:02 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Indeed
3/2/24, 9:02 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Being a career counsellor, my aspirations for young learners like you are similar. I firmly believe higher education should combine the following for a learner to achieve their goals:-

Quality Education
Conducive Environment
Critical Thinking and Practical learning skills
Technological Literacy and Attachments
Cultural Awareness and Global Perspective
Career guidance, Mentorships, etc.

*However, not everyone achieves success. Do you know why*?
3/2/24, 9:03 AM - +263 78 727 6897: No
3/2/24, 9:04 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
3/2/24, 9:04 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Therefore, It is important to know the facts of Edoofa's guidance and uniqueness compared to the normal University approach.

1) *Personalized mentorship and guidance throughout your course:-* As your Career Counsellor, I have known you since the beginning of the process, understanding your interests, aspirations, family background and plans for your career, unlike a University officer who may come across your application for the first time and treats with the same importance like others. I personally understand where you come from and what is required for you to be successful.
3/2/24, 9:04 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: 3) *Financial Support and Planning:-* With a flexible payment plan for registration fees spreading across 45 days, the remaining cost of education can be paid in two installments. Students are ensured to open Indian bank accounts so that parents can even deposit the fees in monthly installments.

3/2/24, 9:04 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
3/2/24, 9:05 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: These are aspects that no other organization or University possesses as of now, I hope you are looking forward to such an opportunity for your career, aren't you?
3/2/24, 9:07 AM - +263 78 727 6897: I am
3/2/24, 9:08 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Perfect, To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is Bachelor of Technology in Civil Engineering and your intake is in August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information is accurate?
3/2/24, 9:08 AM - +263 78 727 6897: Yes it is accurate <This message was edited>
3/2/24, 9:15 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: As I have promised, the Edoofa Admissions team will be submitting your application to multiple universities that will evaluate your application and upon being eligible, you receive the offer letters with comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. *I will guide you to the best education institution/university associated with us that aligns with your vision and interest and would provide you with a conducive environment for your holistic development and to fulfil your career goals.*

Upon receiving the Offer Letter, you will have a few weeks to pay a portion of your university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. We discussed the registration fee during our counselling sessions. May I know, what do you recall about the same now?
3/2/24, 9:18 AM - +263 78 727 6897: I was of the understanding that being an Edoofian the registration fee would be catered for.
3/2/24, 9:28 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Let me help you with a better understanding. *Usually, the registration fee is an additional fee apart from the cost of education but Edoofians receive an exclusive benefit where it is a part of the cost of education itself.* Let me give you an example:-
3/2/24, 9:28 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: As we discussed in the counseling session, the cost of education in India ranges from $6000-$8000 per annum which is reduced to $1600-$2300 per annum through the Edoofa Scholarship Program *as I will be recommending your application for a higher quantum of scholarship.* Congratulations on securing the same. Now, let us assume,
3/2/24, 9:28 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: 1. *Tuition Fee*: $1000 per annum
2. *Accommodation Fee*: $800 per annum
3. *Remaining Fee Components*: [Library Fee, Examination Fee, EDB and Book Bank, International Student Development Fund, 24-Hour WiFi Cost, Maintenance Fee, Water Bill, and Electricity Bill]: $200 per annum

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1000 + Accommodation Fee $800 + Remaining Fee Components $200 = $2000 per annum.

4. *Registration Fee to be paid:* $1000
3/2/24, 9:28 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: This means this registration fee will be waived off from the cost of education ($2000-$1000 = $1000) and this remaining fee of $1000 can be paid in two installments. The first part of $500 within 3 days after your arrival here in India and the remaining $500 will be due in December 2024, or before your second semester begins.
3/2/24, 9:28 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: This means this registration fee will be waived off from the cost of education ($1650-$1000= $650) and this remaining fee of $650 is supposed to be paid within 3 days of arrival.

*Do you have any questions for me regarding the same?*
3/2/24, 9:29 AM - +263 78 727 6897: Well you said it will be paid in two installments right
3/2/24, 9:31 AM - +263 78 727 6897: So my parents don't have to cater for any expenses given that l have a 100% scholarship
3/2/24, 9:32 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: That is right, The registration fee can be paid either in two equal parts(The first half within 15 days and the second half within 30 days) or in one go itself.

Are you clear with the details?
3/2/24, 9:32 AM - +263 78 727 6897: Yes
3/2/24, 9:35 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: I have recommended your application for upto a 100% scholarship on tuition fees, which means which means you will be left with the basic living expenses and the miscellaneous university costs.
3/2/24, 9:36 AM - +263 78 727 6897: You said tution fee and full accomodation sponsorship
3/2/24, 9:36 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: The cos after the scholarship would be lower than $2000 that is much lesser than Zimbabwe and through the EWYL program, you can even self finance your higher education!
3/2/24, 9:37 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: At the same time, if you are flexible about the course, I can recommend for courses where you can even gain a higher quantum of scholarship where the cost of education would be lesser than $1400 per annum
3/2/24, 9:37 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: That is correct, Jenipher!
The remaining costs would be of Food and Miscellaneous fees of University(for eg, library fee, infrastructure fee, examination fee etc)
3/2/24, 9:38 AM - +263 78 727 6897: Okay
3/2/24, 9:39 AM - +263 78 727 6897: Please explain further on miscellaneous fees
3/2/24, 9:39 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Miscellaneous referes to the fees I have shared here such as Library Fee, Examination Fee, EDB and Book Bank, International Student Development Fund, 24-Hour WiFi Cost, Maintenance Fee, Water Bill, and Electricity Bill etc
3/2/24, 9:40 AM - +263 78 727 6897: Which may amount to how much
3/2/24, 9:40 AM - +263 78 727 6897: Even after l get the scholarship there is still an amount that needs to be paid by my parents right
3/2/24, 9:47 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: That is correct, Jenipher!
This is because the consideration has been for tuition fees and Accommodation. 

Now, for your course of Bachelor of Technology in Civil Engineering, I can recommend your application for a higher-quantum of scholarship after which the costs would be lesser than $2000 per annum.

At the same time, if you are flexible with your course, where you are willing to look out for opportunities is demanding courses in Commercial fields such Bachelor of Commerce, Business Administration or in IT field through the course Computer Applications, I can recommend you for the maximum scholarship for tuition and Accommodation after which you will be left with costs less than $1400 which is for the food and miscellaneous as mentioned. The exact cost would be mentioned on your Offer Letter from University
3/2/24, 9:49 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: On top of this, you will be having the benefit of the Earn While You Learn Program through which you can further reduce the cost of education
3/2/24, 9:51 AM - +263 78 727 6897: I understand
3/2/24, 9:52 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Do you have other questions for me as of now?
3/2/24, 9:56 AM - +263 78 727 6897: No
3/2/24, 9:57 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: I understand that you are interested in this golden opportunity to study in India under the given Scholarship. I do realize that your Family Members may have other concerns and this is the reason I have requested our Program Director Mr. Abhinav to spare some time to talk to your Parents about this. Shall I share the schedule for the same?
