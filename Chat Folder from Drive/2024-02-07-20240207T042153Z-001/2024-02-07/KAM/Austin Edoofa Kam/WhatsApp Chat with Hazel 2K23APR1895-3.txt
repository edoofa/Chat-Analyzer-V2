This transition marks a significant chapter in my life as I will be bidding farewell to the cherished moments at the Admissions Team in Edoofa.

Over the past year, having the privilege of supporting numerous students, including you, in your pursuit of higher education has been truly rewarding. Witnessing our students thrive and excel in their dream universities and colleges has brought immense satisfaction.

8/1/24, 2:03 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Hazel,

I am *Ms. Siddhi Singh, Admission Officer at Edoofa* and I am honoured to assume the responsibilities previously held by Mr. Shivjeet. I will be guiding you toward realising your dream education with Edoofa. I am confident that together, we can ensure a promising start to your educational journey, leading to the right employment opportunities and ultimately, success for you and your family.
8/1/24, 2:03 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: In the past few days, I had an in-depth discussion with Mr. Shivjeet and had the opportunity to review your scholarship application file in our records. Through this process, I gained valuable insights into your dreams and aspirations to advance your academic career. Upon reviewing your application file, I was both impressed and reassured to assist you in achieving these goals here in India, which will unlock doors to incredible opportunities in the future.
8/1/24, 2:03 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Before we get into the specifics of your admission journey and talk about your admission process, I would like to share an exciting milestone that India as a country achieved within the first week of 2024 – the successful *India's Chandrayaan-3 Engine Test.* This accomplishment is responsible for the third lunar mission, aiming to land a rover on the Moon's south polar region and conduct scientific studies that could check Moon's viability to sustain life. It signifies a significant scientific advancement, laying the groundwork for future progress.
8/1/24, 2:03 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This achievement has not only pushed boundaries but also has inspired young minds all over the world to pursue their dreams. On the same note, I wanted to extend my heartiest wishes for the New Year to you and your family and check in to see how you and your family started your year?
16/1/24, 7:53 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Hazel,

I trust this message finds you well, and I hope you are in high spirits. I was hoping to get a response from your end following my previous messages. However, in recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their A-Level results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey.
16/1/24, 7:53 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?

31/1/24, 1:33 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Greetings Mr Munroe and Hazel,
*I am Mr Austin, Senior Career Counsellor at Edoofa*
I hope you all are doing well

If you recall, I hosted your counselling and evaluation sessions, and you made me proud by qualifying for our prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program. I received results from all my students, happy and exhilarating with joy. Recalling our interaction together after a frantic search for your name I ended up messaging you today. I understand your calibre and had a discussion with the Admissions Head and have decided to *personally look after your admission process so that we can proceed with your application on priority through the best possible opportunities and exposures.*

Hence, I request you to come online and notify on this platform so that I can guide you ahead.
31/1/24, 1:36 PM - +263 77 377 4727: Ok
31/1/24, 1:45 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: It is good to connect with you today, Mr Munroe!
I hope you are doing well
31/1/24, 1:46 PM - +263 77 377 4727: I well thank you
31/1/24, 1:46 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Glad to hear that!

31/1/24, 1:49 PM - +263 77 377 4727: I don't know if Hazel knows them,
31/1/24, 1:53 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Noted and Hazel can check once she is online
31/1/24, 1:55 PM - +263 77 377 4727: Ok
31/1/24, 1:55 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Being a career counsellor, my aspirations for young learners like your child is similar. I firmly believe higher education should combine the following for a learner to achieve their goals:-

Quality Education
Conducive Environment
Critical Thinking and Practical learning skills
Technological Literacy and Attachments
Cultural Awareness and Global Perspective
Career guidance, Mentorships, etc.

*However, not everyone achieves success. Do you know why*?
31/1/24, 1:58 PM - +263 77 377 4727: No I don't
31/1/24, 2:13 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
31/1/24, 2:13 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Therefore, It is important to know the facts of Edoofa's guidance and uniqueness compared to the normal University approach.

1) *Personalized mentorship and guidance throughout your course:-* As your Career Counsellor, I have known you since the beginning of the process, understanding your interests, aspirations, family background and plans for your career, unlike a University officer who may come across your application for the first time and treats with the same importance like others. I personally understand where you come from and what is required for you to be successful.
31/1/24, 2:13 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
31/1/24, 2:13 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: 3) *Financial Support and Planning:-* With a flexible payment plan for registration fees spreading across 45 days, the remaining cost of education can be paid in two installments. Students are ensured to open Indian bank accounts so that parents can even deposit the fees in monthly installments.

31/1/24, 2:14 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: These are aspects that no other organization or University possesses as of now, I hope you are looking forward to such an opportunity for your child's career, aren't you?
31/1/24, 3:23 PM - +263 77 377 4727: Yes iam
31/1/24, 3:27 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Perfect, To confirm our records: the course Hazel selected for higher education is Bachelor of Arts-Bachelor of Legislative Law and the intake is in August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information is accurate?
31/1/24, 3:31 PM - +263 77 377 4727: Yes
31/1/24, 3:41 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: As I have promised, the Edoofa Admissions team will be submitting your child's application to multiple universities that will evaluate theapplication and upon being eligible, you receive the offer letters with comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. *I will guide you to the best education institution/university associated with us that aligns with Hazel's vision and interest and would provide her with a conducive environment for holistic development to fulfil career goals.*

Upon receiving the Offer Letter, you will have a few weeks to pay a portion of your university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. We discussed the registration fee during our counselling sessions. May I know, what do you recall about the same now?
1/2/24, 5:41 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
1/2/24, 9:30 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Good Morning Hazel and family, 
I hope you are doing well

As scheduled yesterday, I a here for the session. Are you ready?
1/2/24, 9:38 AM - +263 71 674 5609: Good morning
1/2/24, 9:38 AM - +263 71 674 5609: Yes
1/2/24, 9:46 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Good to hear from you, Hazel! <This message was edited>
1/2/24, 9:47 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Did you manage to go throug the previous sessions?
1/2/24, 9:47 AM - +263 71 674 5609: Yes l did
1/2/24, 9:54 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: So do you recall our discussions regarding the registration fee from our sessions?
1/2/24, 10:41 AM - +263 71 674 5609: I forgot that one
1/2/24, 10:43 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Let me help you with an understanding. *Usually, the registration fee is an additional fee apart from the cost of education but Edoofians receive an exclusive benefit where it is a part of the cost of education itself.* Let me give you an example:-
1/2/24, 10:43 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: As we discussed in the counseling session, the cost of education in India ranges from $6000-$8000 per annum which is reduced to $1200-$1800 per annum through the Edoofa Scholarship Program *as I will be recommending your application for a higher quantum of scholarship.* Congratulations on the same. Now, let us assume,
1/2/24, 10:43 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: 1. *Tuition Fee*: $650 per annum
2. *Accommodation Fee*: $0 per annum (100% Sponsorship)
3. *Remaining Fee Components*: [Library Fee, Examination Fee, EDB and Book Bank, International Student Development Fund, 24-Hour WiFi Cost, Maintenance Fee, Water Bill, and Electricity Bill]: $1000 per annum

*Total Fee: Tuition Fee $650 + Accommodation Fee $0 + Remaining Fee Components $1000 = $1650 per annum.*

4. *Registration Fee to be paid:* $1000
1/2/24, 10:43 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: This means this registration fee will be waived off from the cost of education ($1650-$1000= $650) and this remaining fee of $650 is supposed to be paid within 3 days of arrival.
1/2/24, 10:43 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: The registration fee can be paid either in two equal parts(The first half within 15 days and the second half within 30 days) or in one go itself.

Are you clear with the details?
1/2/24, 10:48 AM - +263 71 674 5609: Okay
1/2/24, 10:48 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Are you clear with the details?
1/2/24, 10:50 AM - +263 71 674 5609: Yah
1/2/24, 10:57 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Noted,  It is really crucial to reserve your University seat with the completion of the registration fees. So I have made a special request to our Academic Board and a recommendation for you to be reconsidered at the earliest. May I know, how far is your family prepared towards the University registration fee as of now?
1/2/24, 11:02 AM - +263 71 674 5609: I need to know what Edoofa can do towards learning at local universities in Zimbabwe
1/2/24, 11:07 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: It wouldn't be possible to cater for local Universities through the Edoofa Scholarship:-
-The cost of education at local universities are higher than that  through the Edoofa program
-We have recommended your application for 80-100% scholarship on tuition and even sponsorship on Accommodation which isn't possible at local universities
-We provide various career training programs, webinars, seminars, industrial visits, campus trainings, individual mentorship and various benefits which isn't provided by any of the local universities
1/2/24, 11:08 AM - +263 71 674 5609: Okay
1/2/24, 11:11 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Do you have other questions for me?
1/2/24, 11:26 AM - +263 71 674 5609: No
1/2/24, 11:31 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: I understand that you are interested in this golden opportunity to study in India under the given Scholarship. I do realize that your Family Members may have other concerns and this is the reason I have requested our Program Director Mr. Abhinav to spare some time to talk to your Parents about this. Is your parent available to share the schedule?
6/2/24, 3:57 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Good Day, Hazel!
