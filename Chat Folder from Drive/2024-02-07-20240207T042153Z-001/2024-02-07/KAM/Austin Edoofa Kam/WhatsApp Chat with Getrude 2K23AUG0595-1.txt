I hope this message finds you well. In regards to my previous messages, I wanted to share that I am looking forward for our discussion today regarding your admission journey. I am here at the scheduled time and am looking forward to our conversation. Please let me know if you are available for the discussion.

I am genuinely excited and eagerly awaiting your response.
16/1/24, 12:06 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Getrude,

I trust this message finds you well, and I hope you are in high spirits. In recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their A-Level results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey.
16/1/24, 12:06 PM - Ashi Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?
19/1/24, 1:37 PM - +27 62 987 3350: Hello Edoofa hope you are well

22/1/24, 11:33 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Greetings dear parents and Artwell
*I am Mr Austin, Senior Career Counsellor at Edoofa*
I hope you all are doing well

If you recall, I hosted your counselling and evaluation sessions, and you made me proud by qualifying for our prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program. I received results from all my students, happy and exhilarating with joy. Recalling our interaction together after a frantic search for your name I ended up messaging you today. I understand your calibre and had a discussion with the Admissions Head and have decided to *personally look after your admission process so that we can proceed with your application on priority through the best possible opportunities and exposures.*

Hence, I request you to come online at *2:00 pm CAT tomorrow* and notify on this platform so that I can guide you ahead.
23/1/24, 2:19 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Good Day dear parents and Getrude
Hope you are doing well

As informed yesterday, I am here to guide you further in your university registration process. 

Are you ready to begin?
23/1/24, 2:22 PM - +27 62 987 3350: Good day to you Mr Austin  

Thank you
23/1/24, 2:30 PM - +27 71 682 5189: Good day Mr Austin

23/1/24, 3:17 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: *Congratulations on the good A-level results of Getrude* At the same time, I was going through your Admissions Group and was shocked to see that you weren't able to complete the University registration process while Getrude being a bright student and I still remember her passion for career and goals, making her one of my favourite students. I personally had a discussion with the Admissions Head and have decided to help you in the best possible way as I understand Getrrude's calibre.
23/1/24, 3:17 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: So are you actively available for a discussion now?
23/1/24, 3:22 PM - +27 62 987 3350: Yes we are
23/1/24, 3:22 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Great, do you know we at EDOOFA received 2000 Applications in a Single Day just a week before and each day since then we are receiving not less than 1000 Applications each day from students seeking Scholarship? We were overwhelmed and had to reject more applications because of limited seats however were surely intrigued to know the reasons for such an immediate upsurge. Having conversations with my other students who are already preparing to arrive in India under the Edoofa Scholarship shared some mind-boggling Screenshots from the Fee Prospectus of the Universities in Zimbabwe.

6/2/24, 11:49 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: You are most welcome, please let me know once you are online and I will guide you further
6/2/24, 12:06 PM - +27 62 987 3350: Good day to you also

You are much appreciated
6/2/24, 12:07 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: You are welcome, are you available now?
6/2/24, 12:07 PM - +27 62 987 3350: Yes I am
6/2/24, 12:09 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
6/2/24, 12:09 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>

6/2/24, 12:17 PM - +27 62 987 3350: Much appreciated
6/2/24, 12:18 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Indeed, Being a career counsellor, my aspirations for young learners like your child is similar. I firmly believe higher education should combine the following for a learner to achieve their goals:-

Quality Education
Conducive Environment
Critical Thinking and Practical learning skills
Technological Literacy and Attachments
Cultural Awareness and Global Perspective
Career guidance, Mentorships, etc.

*However, not everyone achieves success. Do you know why*?
6/2/24, 12:22 PM - +27 62 987 3350: Why
6/2/24, 12:23 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
6/2/24, 12:23 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Therefore, It is important to know the facts of Edoofa's guidance and uniqueness compared to the normal University approach.

1) *Personalized mentorship and guidance throughout your course:-* As your Career Counsellor, I have known you since the beginning of the process, understanding your interests, aspirations, family background and plans for your career, unlike a University officer who may come across your application for the first time and treats with the same importance like others. I personally understand where you come from and what is required for you to be successful.
6/2/24, 12:24 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
6/2/24, 12:24 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: 3) *Financial Support and Planning:-* With a flexible payment plan for registration fees spreading across 45 days, the remaining cost of education can be paid in two installments. Students are ensured to open Indian bank accounts so that parents can even deposit the fees in monthly installments.

6/2/24, 12:24 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: These are aspects that no other organization or University possesses as of now, I hope you are looking forward to such an opportunity for your child's career, aren't you?
6/2/24, 12:34 PM - +27 62 987 3350: Yaa true
6/2/24, 12:36 PM - +27 62 987 3350: 👏👏👏
6/2/24, 12:36 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Perfect, To confirm our records: the course Getrude selected for her higher education is *Bachelor of Arts-Bachelor of Legislative Law* and the intake is in August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information is accurate? <This message was edited>
6/2/24, 12:37 PM - +27 62 987 3350: True
6/2/24, 12:38 PM - +27 62 987 3350: Yes
6/2/24, 12:44 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: As I have promised, the Edoofa Admissions team will be submitting your child's application to multiple universities that will evaluate your child's application and upon being eligible, you receive the offer letters with comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. *I will guide you to the best education institution/university associated with us that aligns with Getrude's vision and interest and would provide you with a conducive environment for her holistic development and to fulfil the career goals.*

Upon receiving the Offer Letter, you will have a few weeks to pay a portion of your university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. We discussed the registration fee during our counselling sessions. May I know, what do you recall about the same now?
6/2/24, 12:54 PM - +27 62 987 3350: Ok as I told you last time now my things are not okay I don't have a stable job . So I was thinking that she will go university 2025
6/2/24, 12:57 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: I understand and we can consider the same
6/2/24, 1:07 PM - +27 62 987 3350: Ok
6/2/24, 1:15 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: As we discussed in the counseling session, the cost of education in India ranges from $6000-$8000 per annum which is reduced to $1200-$1800 per annum through the Edoofa Scholarship Program *as I will be recommending Getrude's application for a higher quantum of scholarship.* Congratulations on the same. Now, let us assume,
6/2/24, 1:15 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: 1. *Tuition Fee*: $650 per annum
2. *Accommodation Fee*: $0 per annum (100% Sponsorship)
3. *Remaining Fee Components*: [Library Fee, Examination Fee, EDB and Book Bank, International Student Development Fund, 24-Hour WiFi Cost, Maintenance Fee, Water Bill, and Electricity Bill]: $1000 per annum

*Total Fee: Tuition Fee $650 + Accommodation Fee $0 + Remaining Fee Components $1000 = $1650 per annum.*

4. *Registration Fee to be paid:* $1000
6/2/24, 1:15 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: This means this registration fee will be waived off from the cost of education ($1650-$1000= $650) and this remaining fee of $650 is supposed to be paid within 3 days of arrival.
6/2/24, 1:16 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: The registration fee can be paid either in two equal parts(The first half within 15 days and the second half within 30 days) or in one go itself.

Are you clear with the details?
6/2/24, 1:24 PM - +27 62 987 3350: Yes I am
6/2/24, 1:32 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Do you have any questions for me as of now?
6/2/24, 1:34 PM - +27 62 987 3350: So which means as for us we should have to pay $1650 all in one per annum  and it's paid per semester
6/2/24, 1:35 PM - +27 62 987 3350: Or  all in one
6/2/24, 1:52 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: The mentioned cost is per annum and can be paid semester-wise. Moreover, Edoofians open Indian bank accounts after arriving this side to which parents can make monthly deposits, thereby students can collect the accumulated amount and send them together before a semester
6/2/24, 1:52 PM - +27 62 987 3350: Ok I understand
6/2/24, 1:55 PM - +27 62 987 3350: Ok now for this tell us maybe we are not understanding perfectly
6/2/24, 1:59 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: The second option is that, after the arrival of Getrude here in India, our Department of Student Welfare will be helping her in opening an India bank account

You can deposit the cost of education in monthly installments to this account and Getrude can collect them and pay at the bank before the intake
6/2/24, 1:59 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: This would reduce the financial pressure
6/2/24, 2:02 PM - +27 62 987 3350: Ok
6/2/24, 2:03 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Do you have other questions for me?
6/2/24, 2:04 PM - +27 62 987 3350: Yes we have I am waiting for others to connect
6/2/24, 2:06 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: That's alright,  I understand that you are interested in this golden opportunity for your child to study in India under the given Scholarship.  Since this is a very important decision for Angeline's career, I have requested our Program Director Mr. Abhinav to spare some time to talk to your parent, address concerns if any and finalise the University registration process. Shall I share the schedule with you?
6/2/24, 2:07 PM - +27 62 987 3350: Yes
6/2/24, 2:08 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Noted, as of now, he is discussing with our team as we are coming to Zimbabwe next week. Just after that, I will be informing you the schedule
6/2/24, 2:09 PM - +27 62 987 3350: Ok thank you
6/2/24, 2:10 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: You are welcome!
