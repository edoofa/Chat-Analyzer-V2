12/1/24, 5:37 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Tanatswa,

I trust this message finds you in good health. As we step into the second week of January, I wanted to reach out and share an exciting milestone that India as a country achieved within the first week of 2024 - the successful India's Chandrayaan-3 Engine Test.
12/1/24, 5:37 PM - Kirti Edoofa: This accomplishment is responsible for the third lunar mission, aiming to land a rover on the Moon's south polar region and conduct scientific studies that could check Moon's viability to sustain life. It signifies a significant scientific advancement, laying the groundwork for future progress.
12/1/24, 5:37 PM - Kirti Edoofa: This achievement has not only pushed boundaries but also inspired young minds all over the world to pursue their dreams. On the same note, I wanted to extend my heartiest wishes for the New Year to you and your family and check in to see how you and your family started your year?
16/1/24, 12:01 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Proud Edoofians,

I trust this message finds you well, and I hope you are in high spirits. In recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their A-Level results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey.
16/1/24, 12:02 PM - Kirti Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?

22/1/24, 2:26 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Good Day, dear parents and Tanatswa,
*I am Mr Austin, Senior Career Counsellor at Edoofa*
I hope you all are doing well

If you recall, I hosted your counselling and evaluation sessions, and you made me proud by qualifying for our prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program. I received results from all my students, happy and exhilarating with joy. Recalling our interaction together after a frantic search for your name I ended up messaging you today. I understand your calibre and had a discussion with the Admissions Head and have decided to *personally look after your admission process so that we can proceed with your application on priority through the best possible opportunities and exposures.*

Hence I request you to come online at the earliest and notify me so that I can guide you ahead.
22/1/24, 7:11 PM - +263 71 874 5821: Evening. I am now here

22/1/24, 8:26 PM - +263 71 874 5821: Sounds interesting.
22/1/24, 8:26 PM - +263 71 874 5821: Yes.
22/1/24, 8:45 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Indeed Tanatswa, At the same time, do you know we at EDOOFA received 2000 Applications in a Single Day just a week before and each day since then we are receiving not less than 1000 Applications each day from students seeking Scholarship? We were overwhelmed and had to reject more applications because of limited seats however were surely intrigued to know the reasons for such an immediate upsurge. Having conversations with my other students who are already preparing to arrive in India under the Edoofa Scholarship shared some mind-boggling Screenshots from the Fee Prospectus of the Universities in Zimbabwe.

23/1/24, 12:29 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>

23/1/24, 4:34 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: It happened a week before for Edoofians in India, Tanatswa, but do not worry, we will be visiting Zimbabwe next month to host a Mega Seminar for Edoofians in Zimbabwe

23/1/24, 4:37 PM - +263 71 874 5821: True. I understand
23/1/24, 4:53 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Being a career counsellor, my aspirations for young learners like you are similar. I firmly believe higher education should combine the following for a learner to achieve their goals:-

Quality Education
Conducive Environment
Critical Thinking and Practical learning skills
Technological Literacy and Attachments
Cultural Awareness and Global Perspective
Career guidance, Mentorships, etc.

*However, not everyone achieves success. Do you know why*?
23/1/24, 5:44 PM - +263 71 874 5821: I think I know.
23/1/24, 5:44 PM - +263 71 874 5821: But you can tell me?
23/1/24, 5:50 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Sure Tanatswa
23/1/24, 5:50 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
23/1/24, 5:50 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Therefore, It is important to know the facts of Edoofa's guidance and uniqueness compared to the normal University approach.

1) *Personalized mentorship and guidance throughout your course:-* As your Career Counsellor, I have known you since the beginning of the process, understanding your interests, aspirations, family background and plans for your career, unlike a University officer who may come across your application for the first time and treats with the same importance like others. I personally understand where you come from and what is required for you to be successful.
23/1/24, 5:50 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
23/1/24, 5:50 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: 3) *Financial Support and Planning:-* With a flexible payment plan for registration fees spreading across 45 days, the remaining cost of education can be paid in two installments. Students are ensured to open Indian bank accounts so that parents can even deposit the fees in monthly installments.

With this positive note, are we good to begin today's session?
24/1/24, 11:06 AM - +263 71 874 5821: Morning
Yes
24/1/24, 11:18 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Good to hear fromyou, Tanatswa!
24/1/24, 11:18 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Perfect, To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is Bachelor of Science in Medical Lab Technology and your intake is in August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information is accurate?
25/1/24, 6:25 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Tanatswa, I see there have been delays in the discussion and I have been waiting for you
25/1/24, 6:25 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: What happened please?
25/1/24, 8:29 AM - +263 71 874 5821: Morning
25/1/24, 8:31 AM - +263 71 874 5821: Network is low
25/1/24, 8:31 AM - +263 71 874 5821: Yes, this is true
25/1/24, 8:31 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Good Morning Tanatswa!
How are you doing?
25/1/24, 8:31 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: I understand, is the network fine now?
25/1/24, 8:33 AM - +263 71 874 5821: Sure. We can continue
25/1/24, 8:34 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: As I have promised, the Edoofa Admissions team will be submitting your application to multiple universities that will evaluate your application and upon being eligible, you receive the offer letters with comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. *I will guide you to the best education institution/university associated with us that aligns with your vision and interest and would provide you with a conducive environment for your holistic development and to fulfil your career goals.*

Upon receiving the Offer Letter, you will have a few weeks to pay a portion of your university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. We discussed the registration fee during our counselling sessions. May I know, what do you recall about the same now?
25/1/24, 8:37 AM - +263 71 874 5821: A registration fee is a fee that is paid to secure your place at the desired university.
25/1/24, 8:38 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Indeed Tanatswa. Let me help you with a better understanding. *Usually, the registration fee is an additional fee apart from the cost of education but Edoofians receive an exclusive benefit where it is a part of the cost of education itself.* Let me give you an example:-
25/1/24, 8:39 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: As we discussed in the counselling session, the cost of education in India ranges from $6000-$8000 per annum which is reduced to $2000-$3000 per annum through the Edoofa Scholarship Program which includes the registration fee, remaining tuition fees, Accommodation, Food, Wifi, Laundry, library fee etc. Now, let us assume,

1. *Tuition Fee*: $1800 per annum
2. *Food and Accommodation Fee*: $1000 per annum 
Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum
3. *Registration Fee to be paid:* $1000
25/1/24, 8:39 AM - +263 71 874 5821: I am waiting
25/1/24, 8:39 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: This means this registration fee that you pay will be subtracted from the cost of education ($2800-$1000= $1800) and the remaining fee of $1800 can be paid in two installments. The first part of $900 within 3 days after your arrival here in India and the remaining $900 will be due in December 2024, or before your second semester begins.
25/1/24, 8:39 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: The registration fee can be paid either in two equal parts(The first half within 15 days and the second half within 30 days) or in one go itself.

Are you clear with the details?
25/1/24, 8:40 AM - +263 71 874 5821: I understand
25/1/24, 8:41 AM - +263 71 874 5821: Shall we proceed
25/1/24, 8:42 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Indeed, do you have any questions for me as of now?
25/1/24, 8:42 AM - +263 71 874 5821: No
25/1/24, 8:47 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Alright Tanatswa,  It is really crucial to reserve your University seat with the completion of the registration fees. So I have made a special request to our Academic Board and a recommendation for you to be reconsidered at the earliest. May I know, how far is your family prepared towards the University registration fee as of now?
25/1/24, 6:16 PM - +263 71 874 5821: I will be sure to ask them first
25/1/24, 7:57 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Sure Tanatswa, by when will you be able to give me feedback?
