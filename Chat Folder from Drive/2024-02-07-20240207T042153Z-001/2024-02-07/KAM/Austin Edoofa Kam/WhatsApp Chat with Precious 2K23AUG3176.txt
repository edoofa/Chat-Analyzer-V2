16/1/24, 12:00 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Precious,

I trust this message finds you well, and I hope you are in high spirits. In recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their A-Level results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey.
16/1/24, 12:00 PM - Ashi Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?
30/1/24, 9:36 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Greetings dear parent and Precious 
*I am Mr Austin, Senior Career Counsellor at Edoofa*
I hope you all are doing well

If you recall, I hosted your counselling and evaluation sessions, and you made me proud by qualifying for our prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program. I received results from all my students, happy and exhilarating with joy. Recalling our interaction together after a frantic search for your name I ended up messaging you today. I understand your calibre and had a discussion with the Admissions Head and have decided to *personally look after your admission process so that we can proceed with your application on priority through the best possible opportunities and exposures with affordability.*

Hence, I request you to come online *at 8:30 am CAT tomorrow (31/01/2024)* and notify on this platform so that I can guide you ahead.
30/1/24, 9:41 PM - +265 885 25 22 54: Thank you for your consideration it has been a very long time since we communicated.I'm glad to hear from you,hence I'll be available tomorrow
31/1/24, 8:48 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Good Morning to you all! 
I hope you are doing well

As scheduled yesterday, I am here to continue your session and guide you through the University registration process. 

Are you ready for the same?
31/1/24, 9:01 AM - +265 885 25 22 54: Ready
31/1/24, 9:14 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Good to hear from you, Precious!
31/1/24, 9:14 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
31/1/24, 9:14 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
31/1/24, 9:15 AM - +265 885 25 22 54: This is amazing
31/1/24, 9:17 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Indeed, Precious!
31/1/24, 9:23 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: At the same time, I was going through your Admissions Group and was shocked to see that you weren't able to complete the University registration process being a bright student and I still remember your passion for career and goals, making you one of my favourite students. I personally had a discussion with the Admissions Head and have decided to help you in the best possible way as I understand your calibre.  So may I know, are you facing any challenges as of now and what are your plans ahead for your higher education?
31/1/24, 10:19 AM - +265 885 25 22 54: We're very low in finance that we can not be able to pay for my higher I education but It was my ambition to study abroad it's just that our finances are not sufficient to study abroad sir
31/1/24, 10:21 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: I understand Precious, so, have you researched on the cost of higher education in Malawi and compared the same with that through the Edoofa Scholarship?
31/1/24, 10:22 AM - +265 885 25 22 54: Yes
31/1/24, 11:06 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Noted, and what did you learn through the researches?
31/1/24, 11:22 AM - +265 885 25 22 54: The fees are quite different
31/1/24, 11:31 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: So, how much do you think a student will have to spend for tuition, Accommodation, Food, Wifi, Laundry etc to study in Malawi?
31/1/24, 11:33 AM - +265 885 25 22 54: Approximately $1600 per year
31/1/24, 1:50 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: That is correct, Precious and the cost of education through the Edoofa Scholarship Program is even lesser than that and can be further reduced through the Earn While You Learn program
31/1/24, 1:50 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: So, don't you feel it is better and more affordable through the Edoofa Program?
31/1/24, 2:21 PM - +265 885 25 22 54: The processing fee is also too much for my Mom
31/1/24, 2:28 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: I understand and are you aware that the registration fee is a part of this cost of education itself?
31/1/24, 2:31 PM - +265 885 25 22 54: Yes
31/1/24, 2:35 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Noted, so how much time will your family require to raise the fees?
31/1/24, 3:11 PM - +265 885 25 22 54: We already gave up studying abroad😔😔 but here it is this whole year
31/1/24, 3:26 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Precious, you think about it from a logical perspective, the cost of studying in India through the Edoofa Scholarship Program is lesser than what you do in Malawi, that too with much more exposures
31/1/24, 3:26 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: So, don't you feel it is more feasible to study through the Edoofa program?
31/1/24, 3:28 PM - +265 885 25 22 54: It is
31/1/24, 3:36 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: So may I ask Precious, what amount will your family be able to keep aside in a month towards your higher education?
31/1/24, 4:44 PM - +265 885 25 22 54: I'm not sure about that
31/1/24, 4:51 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Can you please discuss with your family and share feedback?
31/1/24, 5:03 PM - +265 885 25 22 54: Ookay
1/2/24, 5:36 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Good Morning Precious!
