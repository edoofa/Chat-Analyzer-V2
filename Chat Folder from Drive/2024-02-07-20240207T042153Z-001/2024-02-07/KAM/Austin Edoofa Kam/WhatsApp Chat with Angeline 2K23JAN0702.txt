22/1/24, 11:26 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Greetings dear parents and Angeline
*I am Mr Austin, Senior Career Counsellor at Edoofa*
I hope you all are doing well

If you recall, I hosted your counselling and evaluation sessions, and you made me proud by qualifying for our prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program. I received results from all my students, happy and exhilarating with joy. Recalling our interaction together after a frantic search for your name I ended up messaging you today. I understand your calibre and had a discussion with the Admissions Head and have decided to *personally look after your admission process so that we can proceed with your application on priority through the best possible opportunities and exposures.*

Hence, I request you to come online at *11:30 am CAT tomorrow* and notify on this platform so that I can guide you ahead.
23/1/24, 6:17 AM - +263 77 372 0205: Thank you
23/1/24, 11:48 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Good Day dear parents and Angeline,

23/1/24, 1:20 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: *Congratulations on your excellent A-level results, Angeline* At the same time, I was going through your Admissions Group and was shocked to see that you are yet to complete the University registration process being a bright student. I personally had a discussion with the Admissions Head and have decided to help you in the best possible way as I understand your calibre.  

So are you actively available to begin the session?
23/1/24, 1:32 PM - +263 77 372 0205: Thank you yes I am now available for the session
23/1/24, 1:48 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: You are welcome!
23/1/24, 1:48 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: At the same time, do you know we at EDOOFA received 2000 Applications in a Single Day just a week before and each day since then we are receiving not less than 1000 Applications each day from students seeking Scholarship? We were overwhelmed and had to reject more applications because of limited seats however were surely intrigued to know the reasons for such an immediate upsurge. Having conversations with my other students who are already preparing to arrive in India under the Edoofa Scholarship shared some mind-boggling Screenshots from the Fee Prospectus of the Universities in Zimbabwe.

Do you know them as your seniors? <This message was edited>
25/1/24, 10:13 AM - +263 78 534 2029: Yes they were my seniors
25/1/24, 10:22 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Indeed, Angeline!
25/1/24, 10:22 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Being a career counsellor, my aspirations for young learners like you are similar. I firmly believe higher education should combine the following for a learner to achieve their goals:-

Quality Education
Conducive Environment
Critical Thinking and Practical learning skills
Technological Literacy and Attachments
Cultural Awareness and Global Perspective
Career guidance, Mentorships, etc.

*However, not everyone achieves success. Do you know why*?
27/1/24, 10:56 AM - +263 78 534 2029: Sir how are you
29/1/24, 8:56 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Good Morning Angeline!
I am doing well, thanks for asking
29/1/24, 8:57 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: I see there has been delays in responses, may I know what happened please?
6/2/24, 10:12 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Good Day dear parents and Angeline!
How are you doing?
6/2/24, 10:13 AM - +263 77 372 0205: We are fine . Thank you for the kind gesture
6/2/24, 10:14 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Good to hear that! <This message was edited>
6/2/24, 10:15 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: It is important to know the facts of Edoofa's guidance and uniqueness compared to the normal University approach.

1) *Personalized mentorship and guidance throughout your course:-* As your Career Counsellor, I have known you since the beginning of the process, understanding your interests, aspirations, family background and plans for your career, unlike a University officer who may come across your application for the first time and treats with the same importance like others. I personally understand where you come from and what is required for you to be successful.
6/2/24, 10:15 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
6/2/24, 10:15 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: 3) *Financial Support and Planning:-* With a flexible payment plan for registration fees spreading across 45 days, the remaining cost of education can be paid in two installments. Students are ensured to open Indian bank accounts so that parents can even deposit the fees in monthly installments.

6/2/24, 10:15 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
6/2/24, 10:16 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: These are aspects that no other organization or University possesses as of now, I hope you are looking forward to such an opportunity for your child's career, aren't you?
6/2/24, 10:21 AM - +263 77 372 0205: Thank surely we are looking forward for such aa wonderful opportunity for our child
6/2/24, 10:21 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: That is good to hear!
6/2/24, 10:22 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: To confirm our records: the course your child selected for her higher education is Bachelor of Science in Agriculture and her intake is in August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information is accurate?
6/2/24, 10:37 AM - +263 77 372 0205: Thank you it's correct
6/2/24, 10:46 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: As I have promised, the Edoofa Admissions team will be submitting your child's application to multiple universities that will evaluate your application and upon being eligible, you receive the offer letters with comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. *I will guide your child to the best education institution/university associated with us that aligns with your child's vision and interest and would provide you with a conducive environment for Angeline's holistic development and to fulfil her career goals.*

Upon receiving the Offer Letter, you will have a few weeks to pay a portion of your university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. We discussed the registration fee during our counselling sessions. May I know, what do you recall about the same now?
6/2/24, 10:53 AM - +263 77 372 0205: Yes I remember paying $200 towards the registration fee and a balance of $179 was left
6/2/24, 10:55 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: That was the enrollment fee
6/2/24, 10:55 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Let me help you with a better understanding. *Usually, the registration fee is an additional fee apart from the cost of education but Edoofians receive an exclusive benefit where it is a part of the cost of education itself.* Let me give you an example:-
6/2/24, 10:55 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: As we discussed in the counselling session, the cost of education in India ranges from $6000-$8000 per annum which is reduced to $2000-$3000 per annum through the Edoofa Scholarship Program which includes the registration fee, remaining tuition fees, Accommodation, Food, Wifi, Laundry, library fee etc. Now, let us assume,

1. *Tuition Fee*: $1800 per annum
2. *Food and Accommodation Fee*: $1000 per annum 
Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum
3. *Registration Fee to be paid:* $1000
6/2/24, 10:55 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: This means this registration fee that you pay will be subtracted from the cost of education ($2800-$1000= $1800) and the remaining fee of $1800 can be paid in two installments. The first part of $900 within 3 days after your arrival here in India and the remaining $900 will be due in December 2024, or before your second semester begins.
6/2/24, 10:55 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: The registration fee can be paid either in two equal parts(The first half within 15 days and the second half within 30 days) or in one go itself.

Are you clear with the details?
6/2/24, 11:15 AM - +263 77 372 0205: I understand
6/2/24, 11:29 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Do you have any questions for me as of now?
6/2/24, 11:50 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Looking forward to hearing from you, please @263773720205
6/2/24, 12:48 PM - +263 77 372 0205: May I know about transport arrangements from this place to India
6/2/24, 12:55 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: The cost of transportation is catered by the student's family. Our team will be welcoming Edoofians at the airport and guiding them to their Universities
6/2/24, 12:57 PM - +263 77 372 0205: K thank you
6/2/24, 1:00 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: You are welcome!
6/2/24, 1:01 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Mr Mashawi,  I understand that you are interested in this golden opportunity for your child to study in India under the given Scholarship.  Since this is a very important decision for Angeline's career, I have requested our Program Director Mr. Abhinav to spare some time to talk to your parent, address concerns if any and finalise the University registration process. Shall I share the schedule with you?
6/2/24, 1:46 PM - +263 77 372 0205: K thank you.You can go ahead
6/2/24, 2:00 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Noted, as of now, he is discussing with our team as we are coming to Zimbabwe next week. Just after that, I will be informing you the schedule
6/2/24, 2:00 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Meanwhile, Angeline, Please share the following documents with us as they are required for your university application preparation:

*1. A-Level Result/Letter of Recommendation/Statement of Entry (A-Level).*
