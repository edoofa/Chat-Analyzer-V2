12/1/24, 5:52 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Zoleka,

I trust this message finds you in good health. As we step into the second week of January, I wanted to reach out and share an exciting milestone that India as a country achieved within the first week of 2024 - the successful India's Chandrayaan-3 Engine Test.
12/1/24, 5:52 PM - Kirti Edoofa: This accomplishment is responsible for the third lunar mission, aiming to land a rover on the Moon's south polar region and conduct scientific studies that could check Moon's viability to sustain life. It signifies a significant scientific advancement, laying the groundwork for future progress.
12/1/24, 5:52 PM - Kirti Edoofa: This achievement has not only pushed boundaries but also inspired young minds all over the world to pursue their dreams. On the same note, I wanted to extend my heartiest wishes for the New Year to you and your family and check in to see how you and your family started your year?
16/1/24, 12:19 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Proud Edoofians,

I trust this message finds you well, and I hope you are in high spirits. In recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their A-Level results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey.

*I am Mr Austin, Senior Career Counsellor at Edoofa*
I hope you all are doing well

If you recall, I hosted your counselling and evaluation sessions, and you made me proud by qualifying for our prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program. I received results from all my students, happy and exhilarating with joy. Recalling our interaction together after a frantic search for your name I ended up messaging you today. I understand your calibre and had a discussion with the Admissions Head and have decided to *personally look after your admission process so that we can proceed with your application on priority through the best possible opportunities and exposures.*

Hence, I request you to come online at *2:00 pm CAT tomorrow* and notify on this platform so that I can guide you ahead.

23/1/24, 4:13 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: *Congratulations on your excellent A-level results, Zoleka* At the same time, I was going through your Admissions Group and was shocked to see that you are yet to complete the University registration process while Zoleka being a bright student and I still remember her passion for career and goals, making her one of my favourite students. I personally had a discussion with the Admissions Head and have decided to help you in the best possible way as I understand Zoleka's calibre.
23/1/24, 4:15 PM - +263 78 166 5779: Thank you Sir....

23/1/24, 4:31 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Do you know we at EDOOFA received 2000 Applications in a Single Day just a week before and each day since then we are receiving not less than 1000 Applications each day from students seeking Scholarship? We were overwhelmed and had to reject more applications because of limited seats however were surely intrigued to know the reasons for such an immediate upsurge. Having conversations with my other students who are already preparing to arrive in India under the Edoofa Scholarship shared some mind-boggling Screenshots from the Fee Prospectus of the Universities in Zimbabwe.

25/1/24, 10:00 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Good to hear from you, Zoleka!
25/1/24, 10:00 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: I understand
25/1/24, 10:00 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Do you recall our previous discussions?
25/1/24, 10:01 AM - +263 78 166 5779: Yes
25/1/24, 10:02 AM - +263 78 166 5779: So Sir my schoolarship is now  80%
25/1/24, 10:02 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Great, Being a career counsellor, my aspirations for young learners like you are similar. I firmly believe higher education should combine the following for a learner to achieve their goals:-

Quality Education
Conducive Environment
Critical Thinking and Practical learning skills
Technological Literacy and Attachments
Cultural Awareness and Global Perspective
Career guidance, Mentorships, etc.

*However, not everyone achieves success. Do you know why*?
25/1/24, 10:03 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: The final percentage of scholarship will be determined by the following factors

1) Academic Excellence
2) Merit
3) Previous Experiences
4) Recommendations from Edoofa
5) Statement of Purpose(SOP) 
6) Extra curricular Activities

So the Universites will evaluate them to decide the final quantum of scholarship
25/1/24, 10:03 AM - +263 78 166 5779: Ouky Sir
25/1/24, 10:04 AM - +263 78 166 5779: Just because they is lack o determination......
25/1/24, 10:19 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Indeed, that is a major reason
25/1/24, 10:19 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
25/1/24, 10:19 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Therefore, It is important to know the facts of Edoofa's guidance and uniqueness compared to the normal University approach.

1) *Personalized mentorship and guidance throughout your course:-* As your Career Counsellor, I have known you since the beginning of the process, understanding your interests, aspirations, family background and plans for your career, unlike a University officer who may come across your application for the first time and treats with the same importance like others. I personally understand where you come from and what is required for you to be successful.
25/1/24, 10:19 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
25/1/24, 10:19 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: 3) *Financial Support and Planning:-* With a flexible payment plan for registration fees spreading across 45 days, the remaining cost of education can be paid in two installments. Students are ensured to open Indian bank accounts so that parents can even deposit the fees in monthly installments.

25/1/24, 10:19 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: These are aspects that no other organization or University possesses as of now, I hope you are looking forward to such an opportunity for your career, aren't you?
25/1/24, 10:47 AM - +263 78 166 5779: It's still loading Sir
25/1/24, 10:53 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Noted Zoleka, are you facing network challenges?
25/1/24, 11:09 AM - +263 78 166 5779: Yes sir
25/1/24, 11:14 AM - +263 78 166 5779: Yes you definitely correct...l am looking forward for such opportunities for my career
25/1/24, 11:23 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Good to hear that, Zoleka!
25/1/24, 11:24 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is Bachelor of Arts in Travel and Tourism Management and your intake is in August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information is accurate?
25/1/24, 11:25 AM - +263 78 166 5779: Yes it is accurate
25/1/24, 11:29 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: As I have promised, the Edoofa Admissions team will be submitting your application to multiple universities that will evaluate your application and upon being eligible, you receive the offer letters with comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. *I will guide you to the best education institution/university associated with us that aligns with your vision and interest and would provide you with a conducive environment for your holistic development and to fulfil your career goals.*

Upon receiving the Offer Letter, you will have a few weeks to pay a portion of your university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. We discussed the registration fee during our counselling sessions. May I know, what do you recall about the same now?
25/1/24, 11:32 AM - +263 78 166 5779: Regarding university fee
25/1/24, 11:35 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Yes please
25/1/24, 11:38 AM - +263 78 166 5779: A yearly university fee is $2000
25/1/24, 11:40 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Let me help you with a better understanding. *Usually, the registration fee is an additional fee apart from the cost of education but Edoofians receive an exclusive benefit where it is a part of the cost of education itself.* Let me give you an example:-
25/1/24, 11:40 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: As we discussed in the counselling session, the cost of education in India ranges from $6000-$8000 per annum which is reduced to $2000-$3000 per annum through the Edoofa Scholarship Program which includes the registration fee, remaining tuition fees, Accommodation, Food, Wifi, Laundry, library fee etc. Now, let us assume,
25/1/24, 11:40 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: 1. *Tuition Fee*: $1800 per annum
2. *Food and Accommodation Fee*: $1000 per annum 
Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum
3. *Registration Fee to be paid:* $1000 

This means this registration fee that you pay will be subtracted from the cost of education ($2800-$1000= $1800) and the remaining fee of $1800 can be paid in two installments. The first part of $900 within 3 days after your arrival here in India and the remaining $900 will be due in December 2024, or before your second semester begins.
25/1/24, 11:40 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: The registration fee can be paid either in two equal parts(The first half within 15 days and the second half within 30 days) or in one go itself.

Are you clear with the details?
25/1/24, 11:42 AM - +263 78 166 5779: Yes Sir
25/1/24, 11:47 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Do you have any questions for me as of now?
25/1/24, 11:48 AM - +263 78 166 5779: For now l don't ve
25/1/24, 11:56 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Noted,  It is really crucial to reserve your University seat with the completion of the registration fees. So I have made a special request to our Academic Board and a recommendation for you to be reconsidered at the earliest. May I know, how far is your family prepared towards the University registration fee as of now?
31/1/24, 1:07 PM - +263 78 166 5779: They a willing to work hard and produce the money at the earliest
31/1/24, 1:10 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: I appreciate the support of your family, Zoleka, I understand that you are interested in this golden opportunity to study in India under the given Scholarship. I do realize that your Family Members may have other concerns and this is the reason I have requested our Program Director Mr. Abhinav to spare some time to talk to your Parents about this. Is your parent available to share the schedule?
31/1/24, 1:12 PM - +263 78 166 5779: For now lm not with them
31/1/24, 1:17 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: I understand, can you give a call to them and enquire when they will be available?
31/1/24, 1:32 PM - +263 78 166 5779: Ouky will do so Sir
6/2/24, 3:58 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Good Day, Zoleka!
