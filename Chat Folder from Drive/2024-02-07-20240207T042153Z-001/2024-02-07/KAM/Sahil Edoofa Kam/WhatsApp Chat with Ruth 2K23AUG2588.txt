I am *Ms.Harmehak,Senior Career Counsellor at Edoofa*
I hope you all are doing well

If you recall, I hosted your counselling and evaluation sessions, and you made me proud by qualifying for our prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program. I received results from all my students, happy and exhilarating with joy. Recalling our interaction, I remembered that during our session you portrayed an enormous potential of becoming a leader of tomorrow. Hence I have asked my Colleague *Mr.Sahil, Senior Academician*@919821838532 to personally look after your admission process so that we can proceed with your application on priority. 

Hence I request you to come online and continue with your admission procedures.

24/1/24, 12:18 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Good Day , 
*I am Mr Sahil, *Senior Academician* at Edoofa*

 I was going through your Admissions Group and was shocked to see that you weren't able to complete the University registration process being a bright student . I personally had a discussion with the Admissions Head and have decided to help you in the best possible way as I understand your calibre.  May I know, what exactly happened due to which you weren't able to proceed and what are your plans as of now? <This message was edited>
24/1/24, 12:29 PM - +263 77 886 1991: There were financial altercations that happened which resulted in us being unable to clear up and finish off the registration process
24/1/24, 12:35 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Can you tell me what financial plans you had made since then?
24/1/24, 8:34 PM - +263 77 886 1991: I thought that since admission deadlines had been missed then probably this intake wasn't going to be possible so it then became about working on getting necessary funds before the next intake

6/2/24, 11:23 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: I've personally engaged in discussions regarding Ruth's application with the Director of the Academic Board, aiming to secure the maximum scholarship. Typically, the Director may have limited time, but in response to my specific request, he has agreed to allocate time for this matter. However, your active participation is crucial. By making efforts from your end, I can then effectively advocate for your application to be considered for a higher percentage of scholarship.
6/2/24, 11:42 AM - +263 77 886 1991: Ok I will ask my father to spare time when he can
6/2/24, 12:23 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: It's crucial to understand this, as you are the one currently benefiting from the scholarship, and I am here to assist you.

6/2/24, 12:28 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: It is essential for you to be available 30 minutes in advance for the call. Given the overwhelming influx of applications from thousands of students after A-level results, the time available for the director is extremely limited. I trust you understand the urgency, and I am making efforts to expedite the process for Ruth.
6/2/24, 12:31 PM - +263 77 292 5864: Or maybe why can’t you create an alternative method of communication like email then we respond accordingly cz our time availability seem to clash with our work,time zone
6/2/24, 12:33 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Why complicate the process? We can simplify it to a brief 5-10 minute call.
