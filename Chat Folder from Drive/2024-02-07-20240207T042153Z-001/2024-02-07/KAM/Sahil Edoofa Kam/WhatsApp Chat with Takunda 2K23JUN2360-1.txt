12/1/24, 6:01 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Takunda,

I trust this message finds you in good health. As we step into the second week of January, I wanted to reach out and share an exciting milestone that India as a country achieved within the first week of 2024 - the successful India's Chandrayaan-3 Engine Test.
12/1/24, 6:01 PM - Kirti Edoofa: This accomplishment is responsible for the third lunar mission, aiming to land a rover on the Moon's south polar region and conduct scientific studies that could check Moon's viability to sustain life. It signifies a significant scientific advancement, laying the groundwork for future progress.
12/1/24, 6:01 PM - Kirti Edoofa: This achievement has not only pushed boundaries but also inspired young minds all over the world to pursue their dreams. On the same note, I wanted to extend my heartiest wishes for the New Year to you and your family and check in to see how you and your family started your year?
16/1/24, 12:27 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Proud Edoofians,

I trust this message finds you well, and I hope you are in high spirits. In recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their A-Level results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey.
16/1/24, 12:27 PM - Kirti Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?
17/1/24, 10:24 PM - +263 77 926 5201: Hello how are you 

I’m very happy to hear this. I was able to collect my results just recently and I am looking forward to what the next steps in my application look like. 🙏

I was able to get a B in computer science, a C in economics and a D in business studies - 9 points in total

22/1/24, 1:30 PM - Harmehak Edoofa: Good Day Takunda, 

*I am Ms.Harmehak,Senior Career Counsellor at Edoofa*
I hope you all are doing well

If you recall, I hosted your counselling and evaluation sessions, and you made me proud by qualifying for our prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program. I received results from all my students, happy and exhilarating with joy. Recalling our interaction, I remembered that during our session you portrayed an enormous potential of becoming a leader of tomorrow. Hence I have asked my Colleague *Mr.Sahil, Senior Academician* to personally look after your admission process so that we can proceed with your application on priority. 

Hence I request you to come online and continue with your admission procedures.
22/1/24, 2:09 PM - +263 77 497 2961: Hello. I am Takunda's father.  Yes he did send the results last week but he got no response.  Right now he went out and I think he has No network. Will get him to respond to you as soon ashe comes home today
22/1/24, 3:53 PM - +263 77 926 5201: Hello good afternoon, 

My apologies I had gone out and had no internet🙏

I am now on network and able to proceed 

Thank you very much @919871782922
22/1/24, 4:11 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Recalling your counseling and evaluation sessions, I take pride in your qualification for our esteemed Edoofa Scholarship Program. Recently, the A-level results from all my students have brought immense joy. Your name, in particular, caught my attention, and I was going through your Admissions Group and was shocked to see that you weren't able to complete the University registration process being a bright student and I still remember your passion for career and goals, making you one of my favourite students.  I personally had a discussion with the Admissions Head and have decided to help you in the best possible way as I understand your calibre.  May I know, what exactly happened due to which you weren't able to proceed and what are your plans as of now?
22/1/24, 4:14 PM - +263 77 926 5201: I think maybe I was not made aware of the admission process prior to my writing exams,

I’ve only been able to reconnect now as my results have just come in, 

My understanding from our prior sessions was that admissions process would be done after results had come out, I don’t know if I am mistaken in that regard
23/1/24, 10:17 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Good morning,

I've noticed a slower pace in the admission process, and it seems there might be delays on your end due to exams. However, other students who reserved seats have already secured spots. I'm here to expedite the process for you, given my limited time. Your commitment to remaining active is crucial, as I'll be dedicating my personal time to assist you.

Confirmation as per Records: you  have selected BBA (Information Technology), planning to arrive in India by August 2024?
23/1/24, 11:54 AM - +263 77 926 5201: Yes that is correct, 

Thank you very much for all the assistance 🙏
23/1/24, 12:59 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Welcome
23/1/24, 1:00 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: As I have promised, the Edoofa Admissions team will be submitting your application to multiple universities that will evaluate your application and upon being eligible, you receive the offer letters with comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. *I will guide you to the best education institution/university associated with us that aligns with your vision and interest and would provide you with a conducive environment for your holistic development and to fulfil your career goals.*

Upon receiving the Offer Letter, you will have a few weeks to pay a portion of your university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. We discussed the registration fee during our counselling sessions. May I know, what do you recall about the same now?
23/1/24, 1:03 PM - +263 77 926 5201: Oh okay I understand

I do not recall the registration fee amount, but I’m sure we paid a fee last year. I’m not sure if this is the same fee you are referring to?
23/1/24, 1:34 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Let me help you with a better understanding. *Usually, the registration fee is an additional fee apart from the cost of education but Edoofians receive an exclusive benefit where it is waived off from the cost of education itself.* Let me give you an example:-
23/1/24, 1:34 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: As we discussed in the counseling session, the cost of education in India ranges from $6000-$8000 per annum which is reduced to $2700-$3700 per annum through the Edoofa Scholarship Program which includes the registration fee, remaining tuition fees, Accommodation, Food, Wifi, Laundry, library fee etc. Now, let us assume,

1. Tuition Fee: $2600 per annum
2. Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Total Fee: Tuition Fee $2600 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $3600 per annum
3. Registration Fee to be paid: $1000
23/1/24, 1:34 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: This means this registration fee will be waived off from the cost of education($3600-$1000= $2600) and this remaining fee of $2600 can be paid in two installments. The first part of $1300 within 3 days after your arrival here in India and the remaining $1300 will be due in December 2024, or before your second semester begins.

Do you have any questions for me regarding the same?
23/1/24, 1:42 PM - +263 77 926 5201: Okay it’s making sense, 

I won’t be paying the registration fee is what I am understanding, I’ll only be paying the Tuition and accommodation and it’s paid in parts? <This message was edited>
23/1/24, 2:49 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: The registration fee can be paid either in two equal parts(The first half within 15 days and the second half within 30 days) or in one go itself.

Are you clear with the details?
23/1/24, 3:22 PM - +263 77 926 5201: I thought this fee is being waved off as you mentioned before, 

But if it’s not waived off then the details are clear
23/1/24, 4:12 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Alright please, Now with this, we are done with step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
23/1/24, 4:12 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one.
23/1/24, 4:13 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
23/1/24, 4:13 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
23/1/24, 4:13 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received special news for the students of the 2024 admission intake. May I know if you are excited to know the news we have for you?
23/1/24, 4:13 PM - +263 77 926 5201: Thank you very much 🙏
23/1/24, 4:14 PM - +263 77 926 5201: I am excited 🙏
23/1/24, 4:16 PM - +263 77 926 5201: Great opportunity indeed 🙏
23/1/24, 4:32 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: I am happy to see that you are excited. After speaking with thousands of students and parents who completed their admission process before you, we realized that the current economic situation in African countries makes it a bit challenging for parents to pay the full registration fee at once. 

In response to the same challenge, we had a detailed discussion with the academic board and university official. As a result, we developed a solution to alleviate the financial burden of the parents specifically for the registration fee due of $500 to $1000. 

We at Edoofa are thrilled about this development, and I believe it will significantly help all of our students and their families. Are you aware of the solution?
23/1/24, 4:44 PM - +263 77 926 5201: Please let me know of the solution 🙏
23/1/24, 4:56 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: That is alright, let me share the same. With respect to the conversation we had with the academic board and the university officials, we requested them to allow the students to make the payment of their registration fee in two parts within a span of 45 days thereby reducing the financial pressure.

Here's how it works: Consider that your registration fee is $1000. After you will receive the offer letter, the first part of the registration fees which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, i.e. $500 needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university (For most of the universities 15 days). Subsequently, the second part of $500, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
23/1/24, 4:58 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: For example, if your deadline is set for January 25, 2024, and your registration fee stands at $1000, you'll need to make a payment of $500 on or before January 25, 2024. The remaining $500 should be paid by February 25 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
23/1/24, 5:01 PM - +263 77 926 5201: I’m following on the details 

So this is specifically for the registration fee right. 

And for the rest of the tuition you said I pay within 3 days of landing and the rest will be due in December correct ?
23/1/24, 8:47 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I will connect with you *tomorrow again at 09:15 AM CAT* to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care.

Have a good day ahead. 
God Bless You!
23/1/24, 9:11 PM - +263 77 926 5201: Thank you very much for all the help, 

Have a good night 🙏
God bless you too!

24/1/24, 10:41 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
