16/1/24, 12:02 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Kudzai,

I trust this message finds you well, and I hope you are in high spirits. In recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their A-Level results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey.
16/1/24, 12:02 PM - Ashi Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?

Hence I have asked my Colleague *Mr.Sahil, Senior Academician* @919821838532 to personally look after your admission process so that we can proceed with your application on priority. 

Hence I request you to come online and continue with your admission procedures.

24/1/24, 2:02 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Hello Ma'am,
This is Mr. Sahil. I would like to clarify which course was discussed and offered to your child during the session with Ms. Harmehak. It's important to understand the course that you and your child agreed upon after reviewing the acceptance letter and before proceeding with the payment?
24/1/24, 7:16 PM - +263 77 233 1484: Initially we had asked for medicine and we were told u could offer us cardiology since that is what she wants to specialise in. And they came back with a different thing entirely offering medical laboratory technology. I don't want to discuss this anymore Mr Sahil I'm getting bored. Please

While I've identified challenges in your admission process and am here to assist as a member of the academic bench you can clear see I was not a part of admission team, it's crucial that you make the necessary arrangements to enable our support.so please collaborate to streamline the process.

30/1/24, 8:42 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: *Good morning Everyone!*  let's draw inspiration from the timeless wisdom found in the Bible:

*"As the scriptures teach, knowledge is a steadfast companion. A person enlightened by wisdom is held in high regard across all realms. The brilliance of education surpasses the allure of beauty and the vigor of youth."*

 With positive energy, let's continue our interactive session and embrace the transformative power of education. So shall we begin ?
30/1/24, 10:35 AM - +263 77 233 1484: Let's begin
30/1/24, 10:40 AM - +263 77 233 1484: You said u were going to call isn't? I am quite busy so if we can just do this quickly since there's nothing more to talk about

30/1/24, 11:37 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: In Poland right ?
30/1/24, 11:42 AM - +263 77 233 1484: No
30/1/24, 11:44 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: In which university ?
30/1/24, 11:45 AM - +263 77 233 1484: Aaah no don't worry bout that.. let's just finish this so that we go out different paths thanks so much
30/1/24, 12:13 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Please understand, I am here to provide guidance. It is crucial to note that a student cannot pursue Medicine without Biology. Anyone promising that your child can undertake Medicine without Biology is misleading you, as Biology forms the essential foundation for this field. There have been cases where students were unaware that the universities they enrolled in lacked credibility. After completing their courses, these students were unable to obtain a medical license. The criteria for medical practice are stringent, and medical boards do not easily grant doctor licenses. This is because dealing with someone's life directly necessitates prior knowledge. Would you trust someone with your life if they lack the necessary foundational understanding?
30/1/24, 12:15 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: If we were a fake organization, there would be no reason for us to withhold Medicine. We invest time repeatedly to explain because, as a legitimate organization, we are committed to ensuring that we don't waste your child's time and your investment. Please understand our genuine intention.
30/1/24, 6:46 PM - +263 77 233 1484: There's one part that is going to taint you eventually the part you promise to deliver something then deliver something entirely different.
30/1/24, 8:38 PM - +263 77 233 1484: Give me back my money that's all
31/1/24, 10:23 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Please understand refund is not possible as refund is only done if we are unable to provide you admission letter from University.
1/2/24, 8:49 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Good morning
2/2/24, 9:13 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: *Good Morning Everyone*

*I hope you're well. I noticed my previous messages were read, but I haven't received a response.* Your open communication is crucial for me to understand your situation better. *As a member of the Academic board, I can personally assist you in securing a higher percentage of scholarship* possible if you share your concerns openly.Please feel free to share any specific details. Thank you, and I look forward to your response.
3/2/24, 8:50 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Good morning
How are you doing today?
5/2/24, 9:20 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Good morning! let's draw inspiration from the timeless wisdom found in the Bible:

*Proverbs 2:10-11 (NIV):*
*"For wisdom will enter your heart, and knowledge will be pleasant to your soul. Discretion will protect you, and understanding will guard you."*

Let's continue our interactive session and embrace the transformative power of education
5/2/24, 3:59 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: *Embrace education as the key to a brighter future. Proverbs 4:7 (NIV) wisely states, "The beginning of wisdom is this: Get wisdom." Seize the opportunity to break free from limitations. Keep in mind Philippians 4:13 (NIV), "I can do all this through him who gives me strength." Let education empower your child!*

Over the past few days, we've been trying to connect with you to discuss your child's academic journey. We understand the financial commitments involved in providing quality education for your child. The challenges in Africa, particularly the uncertainty of employment after completing a bachelor's degree, are evident.

Considering the urgency of your child's education, I've scheduled a session for *tomorrow at 09:30 AM CAT* .Looking forward to connecting with you tomorrow.
6/2/24, 9:25 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Good morning! let's draw inspiration from the timeless wisdom found in the Bible:

*Proverbs 1:5:*

*"Let the wise listen and add to their learning.' In the tapestry of progress, education is the thread that weaves nations together. As India seeks wisdom, let us prioritize education, creating a future where knowledge transcends boundaries and resonates more profoundly than ever. A commitment to learning is a commitment to a thriving, united nation."*

Let's continue our interactive session and embrace the transformative power of education ,Shall we start?
