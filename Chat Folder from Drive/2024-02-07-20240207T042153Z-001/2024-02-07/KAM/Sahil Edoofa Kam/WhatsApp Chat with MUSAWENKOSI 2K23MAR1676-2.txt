8/1/24, 2:06 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Musawenkosi,

I am *Ms. Siddhi Singh, Admission Officer at Edoofa* and I am honoured to assume the responsibilities previously held by Mr. Shivjeet. I will be guiding you toward realising your dream education with Edoofa. I am confident that together, we can ensure a promising start to your educational journey, leading to the right employment opportunities and ultimately, success for you and your family.
8/1/24, 2:06 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: In the past few days, I had an in-depth discussion with Mr. Shivjeet and had the opportunity to review your scholarship application file in our records. Through this process, I gained valuable insights into your dreams and aspirations to advance your academic career. Upon reviewing your application file, I was both impressed and reassured to assist you in achieving these goals here in India, which will unlock doors to incredible opportunities in the future.
8/1/24, 2:06 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Before we get into the specifics of your admission journey and talk about your admission process, I would like to share an exciting milestone that India as a country achieved within the first week of 2024 – the successful *India's Chandrayaan-3 Engine Test.* This accomplishment is responsible for the third lunar mission, aiming to land a rover on the Moon's south polar region and conduct scientific studies that could check Moon's viability to sustain life. It signifies a significant scientific advancement, laying the groundwork for future progress.
8/1/24, 2:06 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This achievement has not only pushed boundaries but also has inspired young minds all over the world to pursue their dreams. On the same note, I wanted to extend my heartiest wishes for the New Year to you and your family and check in to see how you and your family started your year?
16/1/24, 7:26 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Musawenkosi,

I trust this message finds you well, and I hope you are in high spirits. I was hoping to get a response from your end following my previous messages. However, in recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their A-Level results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey.
16/1/24, 7:26 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?

22/1/24, 12:53 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Recalling our counseling and evaluation sessions, I take pride in your qualification for our esteemed Edoofa Scholarship Program. Recently, the A-level results from all my students have brought immense joy. Your name, in particular, caught my attention, and I was going through your Admissions Group and was shocked to see that you weren't able to complete the University registration process being a bright student and I still remember your passion for career and goals, making you one of my favourite students.  I personally had a discussion with the Admissions Head and have decided to help you in the best possible way as I understand your calibre.  May I know, what exactly happened due to which you weren't able to proceed and what are your plans as of now?
23/1/24, 9:30 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: let's schedule our discussion for tomorrow at 9 AM CAT. If you face challenges or need a different time, let me know in this group. Success often comes from open communication about concerns.

24/1/24, 10:32 AM - +263 77 599 6085: Hie sir I'm the parent of Musawenkosi. I was following the registration process the whole time with my daughter and even during the time your authenticity was questioned on the Usher platform. I went on  to pay the first registration successfully. My trust for Edoofa program is unquestionable. We did not want Musawenkosi to stay much longer before enrolling so we enrolled her with another University. We are extremely sorry for any inconvenience caused. We feel honored that you had such academic interest on our daughter. 
May you kindly highlight on the first registration we paid now that she has gone elsewhere. Thank you for everything.
24/1/24, 12:24 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Thank you for sharing this information. We understand and respect your decision for enrolling Musawenkosi elsewhere.  Additionally, may I know about the university where Musawenkosi has enrolled?
24/1/24, 12:37 PM - +263 77 599 6085: It's in Zambia actually they have started their studies. I wish you comment on my last concern of paid initial registration. I'm thankful for your understanding.
24/1/24, 2:35 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Certainly. Can you provide information about the university where she has enrolled, including the commencement date of her course and the specific program she will be pursuing since A level results just come out?
24/1/24, 6:12 PM - +263 77 599 6085: She enrolled at Eden University and if you check they only use 'O' level results. She is pursuing the Bachelor of nursing. The course started on the 16th of January 2024. Thank you for asking. <This message was edited>

With all positive energy, I am here to continue our interactive session.
25/1/24, 9:34 AM - +263 77 599 6085: Good morning yesterday I tried to answer this question and had no response afterwards. Your concern is appreciated.
25/1/24, 11:43 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Have you checked the credibility of the university? Offering a bachelor's program without A-level results may impact the student's ability to obtain the necessary licenses for future employment.
25/1/24, 12:40 PM - +263 77 599 6085: Everything was verified their first semester is pure sciences and then go deeper into the course. Do you mind shedding light on the issue of your program initial payment that I made.
25/1/24, 1:47 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Please I meant Have you checked the credibility of the university ? Will the degree be recognized for employment ? as doing bachelors without A level is not even legal.
25/1/24, 1:53 PM - +263 77 599 6085: I checked everything and was referred to the administration. I got to learn that A level students are exempted on initial semesters, they take 3 years to complete the course while others take 4 years. You may enquire since I gave you the details of the school you asked for.
If you don't mind you may shed light on my payment to Edoofa that I made <This message was edited>

1/2/24, 8:48 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Good morning!
I trust you are doing well. I've observed that my messages have been read but not responded to. In moments of silence, I'm reminded of Psalm 37:7 (NIV): "Be still before the Lord and wait patiently for him." Is everything alright?
1/2/24, 8:52 AM - +263 77 599 6085: Morning sir everything is well I intended to tell you that the logistics that I went through to get her admitted was a lot. It is impossible at this stage and she has found joy with the new university and course.

However, in this instance, Edoofa is providing the letter, but you express hesitation in continuing with the application process.
1/2/24, 9:42 PM - +263 77 599 6085: My instincts warned me nevertheless it's water under the bridge. People should know the whole package you have in instances like mine
2/2/24, 8:22 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Please refund policy was mentioned on acceptance letter itself.
2/2/24, 8:25 AM - +263 77 599 6085: Good morning It's all fine.

2/2/24, 3:46 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: I wanted to assist you, but it would have been better if you waited for an offer from the university. If there was a delay, you could have called me directly, and I would have taken immediate action.
