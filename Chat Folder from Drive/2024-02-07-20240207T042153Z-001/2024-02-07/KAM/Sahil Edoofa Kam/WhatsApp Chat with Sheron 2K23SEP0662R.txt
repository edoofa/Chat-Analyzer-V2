16/1/24, 11:42 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Sheron,

I trust this message finds you well, and I hope you are in high spirits. In recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their A-Level results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey.
16/1/24, 11:42 AM - Kirti Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?
24/1/24, 9:17 AM - Harmehak Edoofa: Good Day @263771472564 @263779616541  , 

I am *Ms.Harmehak,Senior Career Counsellor at Edoofa*
I hope you all are doing well

If you recall, I hosted your counselling and evaluation sessions, and you made me proud by qualifying for our prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program. I received results from all my students, happy and exhilarating with joy. Recalling our interaction, I remembered that during our session you portrayed an enormous potential of becoming a leader of tomorrow. Hence I have asked my Colleague *Mr.Sahil, Senior Academician* @919821838532 to personally look after your admission process so that we can proceed with your application on priority. 

Hence I request you to come online and continue with your admission procedures.
24/1/24, 8:10 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: I see you have gone through my messages earlier but did not respond back, *please If there is something that is concerning you because of which you are not Proceeding ahead with your process, then I would request you to come forward and address the same with me here in the group so that I can provide you with a solution to cater to your issues and guide you with your admissions procedures.*

Since my working hours for the day are over now, *I have therefore scheduled your session for 09:30 AM CAT tomorrow*

God Bless you,
Have a great day ahead!
25/1/24, 9:22 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Good Morning Everyone,

I personally noticed challenges in your admission process, so I'm here to help. Despite not being part of the admission team, as a member of the academic bench, I'll personally ensure your application is completed within three days, securing the maximum scholarship percentage possible .This will make your education more affordable than studying locally and open up maximum employment prospects.

I trust you are doing well. I've observed that my messages have been read but not responded to. In moments of silence, I'm reminded of Psalm 37:7 (NIV): "Be still before the Lord and wait patiently for him." Is everything alright?

3/2/24, 12:30 PM - +263 77 961 6541: Ok that's fine I am getting you right, but we explained our challenges since last year. You said my daughter can also consult her school authorities right, and she did as per say but unfortunately their conversation brought about some other challenges which were once experienced by her school authorities and by so we decided to retreat. We are no longer coming, we are now enrolling her local. For you be free to refund us our deposited money into your school account.

5/2/24, 7:32 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: May I know why did you opt for education abroad at first place if you didn't have plans to study abroad or is there anything else that effected your decisions?
5/2/24, 8:42 PM - +263 77 961 6541: Yes we did have a plan to study abroad but since we came across that incident which once happened to one of their students. That's why we intended to retreat

Let's continue our interactive session and embrace the transformative power of education ,Shall we start?
6/2/24, 10:03 AM - +263 77 961 6541: Ok, I think we don't understand each other hear and how are we going to proceed if we are on the same page
6/2/24, 11:12 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Did that student enroll in India through Edoofa? I want to emphasize that there's a significant distinction when choosing Edoofa compared to other agents. Unlike many agents, Edoofa takes full accountability for its services. We are not agents; we are a government-registered and highly trusted entity in Africa, with over 13 years of proven reliability.
