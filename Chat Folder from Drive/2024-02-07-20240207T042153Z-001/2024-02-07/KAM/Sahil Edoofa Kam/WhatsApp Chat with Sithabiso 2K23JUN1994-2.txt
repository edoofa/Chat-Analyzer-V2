I want to take a moment to remind you that this result is not a reflection of your abilities or potential. It's simply a hurdle on your academic journey, one that you are more than capable of overcoming.

It's important to remember that everyone faces setbacks at some point. What matters most is how we respond to them. This is an opportunity for growth and learning. Reflect on the experience, identify areas for improvement, and use this as a stepping stone towards future successes.
12/1/24, 7:38 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Please know that you have our full support in navigating this phase. Whether it's discussing options for retaking the exam, exploring alternative paths, or just needing someone to talk to, we are here for you.

*I am Mr Sahil, Senior Career Counsellor at Edoofa*

If you remember well, I hosted the counselling and evaluation sessions for you through the Edoofa Scholarship Program from which you have made me proud by qualifying for the program.
22/1/24, 1:07 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
22/1/24, 1:07 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
22/1/24, 1:07 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Recalling our counseling and evaluation sessions, I take pride in your qualification for our esteemed Edoofa Scholarship Program. Recently, the A-level results from all my students have brought immense joy. Your name, in particular, caught my attention, and I was going through your Admissions Group and was shocked to see that you weren't able to complete the University registration process being a bright student and I still remember your passion for career and goals, making you one of my favourite students.  I personally had a discussion with the Admissions Head and have decided to help you in the best possible way as I understand your calibre.  May I know, what exactly happened due to which you weren't able to proceed and what are your plans as of now?
22/1/24, 1:20 PM - +263 71 572 3973: Good day
22/1/24, 1:21 PM - +263 71 572 3973: This message was deleted
22/1/24, 1:21 PM - +263 71 572 3973: Lam currently in a state of perplexity
Lam not sure if I will get admission with those results or I have to retake A level or re consider taking an option course which I don't have at the moment.Honestly lam in a state of confusion.
My parents said they will wait for Edoofa schoolarship program outcome and take it from there but meanwhile I should be thinking of what I want
22/1/24, 1:43 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Can you please resend your A level results so that I can evaluate them ?

5/2/24, 7:22 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: *Embrace education as the key to a brighter future. Proverbs 4:7 (NIV) wisely states, "The beginning of wisdom is this: Get wisdom." Seize the opportunity to break free from limitations. Keep in mind Philippians 4:13 (NIV), "I can do all this through him who gives me strength." Let education empower your child!*

Over the past few days, we've been trying to connect with you to discuss your child's academic journey. We understand the financial commitments involved in providing quality education for your child. The challenges in Africa, particularly the uncertainty of employment after completing a bachelor's degree, are evident.

Considering the urgency of your child's education, I've scheduled a session for *tomorrow at 09:30 AM CAT* .Looking forward to connecting with you tomorrow.
6/2/24, 9:36 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Good morning! let's draw inspiration from the timeless wisdom found in the Bible:

*Proverbs 1:5:*

*"Let the wise listen and add to their learning.' In the tapestry of progress, education is the thread that weaves nations together. As India seeks wisdom, let us prioritize education, creating a future where knowledge transcends boundaries and resonates more profoundly than ever. A commitment to learning is a commitment to a thriving, united nation."*
