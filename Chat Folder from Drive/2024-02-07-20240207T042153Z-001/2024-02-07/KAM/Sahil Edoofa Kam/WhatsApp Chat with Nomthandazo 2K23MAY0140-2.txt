12/1/24, 5:47 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Nomthandazo,

I trust this message finds you in good health. As we step into the second week of January, I wanted to reach out and share an exciting milestone that India as a country achieved within the first week of 2024 - the successful India's Chandrayaan-3 Engine Test.
12/1/24, 5:47 PM - Kirti Edoofa: This accomplishment is responsible for the third lunar mission, aiming to land a rover on the Moon's south polar region and conduct scientific studies that could check Moon's viability to sustain life. It signifies a significant scientific advancement, laying the groundwork for future progress.
12/1/24, 5:47 PM - Kirti Edoofa: This achievement has not only pushed boundaries but also inspired young minds all over the world to pursue their dreams. On the same note, I wanted to extend my heartiest wishes for the New Year to you and your family and check in to see how you and your family started your year?
13/1/24, 6:08 PM - +263 71 340 6804: Good evening
15/1/24, 9:45 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, kindly excuse me I was occupied with a meeting today and hence I could not move ahead with the discussion with you. Let us plan to reconnect tomorrow so that we can continue with our discussion as planned. Have a blessed night and do convey my regards to your family as well.
15/1/24, 9:46 PM - +263 71 340 6804: Thank you very much we will connect tomorrow
16/1/24, 10:24 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Nomthandazo.

I hope you are doing well. Since we were unable to continue with our discussion yesterday I wanted to reach out and know more about your A-level results. We also had the pleasure of conversing with some of our students who expressed their joy upon receiving their A-Level results.

Reflecting on my own school days, I vividly recall the mix of excitement and anticipation surrounding the result day. It is an important moment that shapes the path of one’s academic journey.
16/1/24, 10:24 AM - Kirti Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?
16/1/24, 10:38 AM - +263 71 340 6804: <Media omitted>
17/1/24, 7:57 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Nomthandazo.

I hope you are doing well. Thank you for sharing your results with us. I noticed that your A-level results didn't turn out as we had hoped, particularly with the challenge in one subject. However, I want to take a moment to remind you that this result is not a reflection of your abilities or potential. It's simply a hurdle on your academic journey, one that you are more than capable of overcoming.
17/1/24, 7:57 AM - Kirti Edoofa: It's important to remember that everyone faces setbacks at some point. What matters most is how we respond to them. This is an opportunity for growth and learning. Reflect on the experience, identify areas for improvement, and use this as a stepping stone towards future successes.
17/1/24, 7:58 AM - Kirti Edoofa: @263713406804 I noticed you saying that you are pleased with your results however, I noticed that you have an F in accounting, could you please help me understand better?
17/1/24, 8:02 AM - +263 71 340 6804: Good morning
Thank you so much for those encouraging words
17/1/24, 8:02 AM - +263 71 340 6804: Thank you very much
17/1/24, 8:02 AM - +263 71 340 6804: We had a challenge with the accounting teacher hence the only subject that l failed
17/1/24, 12:54 PM - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome, however, could you please elaborate more on how did you had your challenges with the accounting teacher this will help me attain a clarity about the situation better?
17/1/24, 12:55 PM - +263 71 340 6804: We did not have a specific accounting teacher
17/1/24, 1:01 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I understand that this might be a reason, however, due to this your result has been impacted. This has led me to wonder about the reasons behind the low grade. If you could provide some insight into this, it would be helpful.

However, I want to assure you that since you are enrolled with Edoofa, there's no need for undue concern. We will be assisting you in your educational journey, ensuring that your career prospects remain unaffected despite these setbacks.
17/1/24, 1:16 PM - +263 71 340 6804: I do not want to continue with the program
My parents do not have enough money to cover up all the costs
17/1/24, 4:45 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I completely understand that you do not wish to continue with the program because of financial concerns, and I respect your decision however, what I am not able to understand is that with your A-level result, you have an F grade in the same, may I know how are you planning to study back at home, which brings me back to my same question which is not answered above. This has led me to wonder about the reasons behind the low grade. If you could provide some insight into this, it would be helpful?
17/1/24, 5:23 PM - +263 71 340 6804: I will go to college and study using my olevel results

Earlier l asked to be excused from this program due to family financial crisis and l hoped to get a response on a way forward rather l was told that l'll have some assistance
2/2/24, 2:50 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Can you please elaborate your concern so that I can explain , maybe I can help you with higher percentage of scholarship
2/2/24, 3:01 PM - +263 71 340 6804: It will be difficult for me to learn outside the country regardless of the percentage of the scholarship.
Well we sat down with my parents and came to à conclusion of not continuing with this program. The reason for that decision is based on the financial challenges my parents are facing now in terms of one of them losing a job and one salary taking care of me and my siblings. As we calculated, we so it best for me to study in Zimbabwe because that would reduce a lot of financial problems because my parents are already in debt with the $350  money they used to pay for holding a seat in this program.
2/2/24, 4:20 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: When you initially decided to study abroad and paid the enrollment fees of $350, it clearly indicated your belief in the superior quality of education offered compared to studying in Zimbabwe. What made you reconsider this decision?
2/2/24, 4:30 PM - +263 71 340 6804: Financial difficulties and not burdening my parents with financial debts that they cannot pay off
3/2/24, 8:30 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Good morning
How are you doing today?
3/2/24, 8:55 AM - +263 71 340 6804: I am fine thanks how are you?
3/2/24, 11:03 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: I am fine thank you
3/2/24, 11:04 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Are your parents available for a call?
3/2/24, 11:09 AM - +263 71 340 6804: I am not sure
They are at the rural areas and the network is very low

Let's continue our interactive session and embrace the transformative power of education
5/2/24, 4:23 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: *Embrace education as the key to a brighter future. Proverbs 4:7 (NIV) wisely states, "The beginning of wisdom is this: Get wisdom." Seize the opportunity to break free from limitations. Keep in mind Philippians 4:13 (NIV), "I can do all this through him who gives me strength." Let education empower your child!*

Over the past few days, we've been trying to connect with you to discuss your child's academic journey. We understand the financial commitments involved in providing quality education for your child. The challenges in Africa, particularly the uncertainty of employment after completing a bachelor's degree, are evident.

6/2/24, 9:33 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Good morning! let's draw inspiration from the timeless wisdom found in the Bible:

*Proverbs 1:5:*

*"Let the wise listen and add to their learning.' In the tapestry of progress, education is the thread that weaves nations together. As India seeks wisdom, let us prioritize education, creating a future where knowledge transcends boundaries and resonates more profoundly than ever. A commitment to learning is a commitment to a thriving, united nation."*
