I trust this message finds you in good health. As we step into the second week of January, I wanted to reach out and share an exciting milestone that India as a country achieved within the first week of 2024 - the successful India's Chandrayaan-3 Engine Test.
16/1/24, 9:46 AM - Ashi Edoofa: This accomplishment is responsible for the third lunar mission, aiming to land a rover on the Moon's south polar region and conduct scientific studies that could check Moon's viability to sustain life. It signifies a significant scientific advancement, laying the groundwork for future progress.

If you remember well, I hosted the counselling and evaluation sessions for you through the Edoofa Scholarship Program from which you have made me proud by qualifying for the program.

24/1/24, 9:31 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Recalling our counseling and evaluation sessions, I take pride in your qualification for our esteemed Edoofa Scholarship Program. Recently, the A-level results from all my students have brought immense joy. Your name, in particular, caught my attention, and I was going through your Admissions Group and was shocked to see that you weren't able to complete the University registration process being a bright student and I still remember your passion for career and goals, making you one of my favourite students.  I personally had a discussion with the Admissions Head and have decided to help you in the best possible way as I understand your calibre.  May I know, what exactly happened due to which you weren't able to proceed and what are your plans as of now?
24/1/24, 10:43 AM - +263 78 027 9838: We did not get the funds the university needed
24/1/24, 10:43 AM - +263 78 027 9838: The amount was too much for us to pay
24/1/24, 10:43 AM - +263 78 027 9838: So we decided to drop out but Ms Saloni said she will try her best to help us
24/1/24, 1:22 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Could you please share the current challenges you're facing so that I can better understand your concerns and explore potential solutions, such as a flexible payment plan?
24/1/24, 1:26 PM - +263 78 027 9838: Challenge that we have is we can't afford to pay the tuition fee or university fee <This message was edited>
24/1/24, 2:43 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Certainly. When you mention that you cannot afford any fees, are you indicating that the student is contemplating discontinuing studies to pursue employment, or is it more about the entire fees being unaffordable, yet you have been able to manage a certain monthly budget?
24/1/24, 3:13 PM - +263 77 644 3634: Yah we can not afford
24/1/24, 3:58 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Kindly elaborate
24/1/24, 4:32 PM - +263 78 027 9838: To pay for the fee
