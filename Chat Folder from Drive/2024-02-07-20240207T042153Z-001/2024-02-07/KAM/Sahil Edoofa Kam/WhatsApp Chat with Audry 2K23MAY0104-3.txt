16/1/24, 11:59 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Audry,

I trust this message finds you well, and I hope you are in high spirits. In recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their A-Level results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey.
16/1/24, 11:59 AM - Ashi Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?

Over the past few days, we've been trying to connect with you to discuss your child's academic journey. We understand the financial commitments involved in providing quality education for your child. The challenges in Africa, particularly the uncertainty of employment after completing a bachelor's degree, are evident.

Considering the urgency of your child's education, I've scheduled a session for *tomorrow at 09:30 AM CAT* .Looking forward to connecting with you tomorrow.
6/2/24, 9:27 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Good morning! let's draw inspiration from the timeless wisdom found in the Bible:

*"Let the wise listen and add to their learning.' In the tapestry of progress, education is the thread that weaves nations together. As India seeks wisdom, let us prioritize education, creating a future where knowledge transcends boundaries and resonates more profoundly than ever. A commitment to learning is a commitment to a thriving, united nation."*
