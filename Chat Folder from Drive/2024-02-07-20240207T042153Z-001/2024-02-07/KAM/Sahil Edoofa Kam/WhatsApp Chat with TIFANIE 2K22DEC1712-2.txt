16/1/24, 4:05 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Tifanie,

I trust this message finds you well, and I hope you are in high spirits. I was hoping to get a response from your end following my previous messages. However, in recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their A-Level results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey.
16/1/24, 4:05 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?
29/1/24, 8:47 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Good Day @263772491420 @263772296885 ,

29/1/24, 8:48 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Recalling our counseling and evaluation sessions, I take pride in your qualification for our esteemed Edoofa Scholarship Program. Recently, the A-level results from all my students have brought immense joy. Your name, in particular, caught my attention, and I was going through your Admissions Group and was shocked to see that you weren't able to complete the University registration process being a bright student and I still remember your passion for career and goals, making you one of my favourite students.  I personally had a discussion with the Admissions Head and have decided to help you in the best possible way as I understand your calibre.  May I know, what exactly happened due to which you weren't able to proceed and what are your plans as of now?
29/1/24, 8:06 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
30/1/24, 8:37 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: *Good morning Everyone!*  let's draw inspiration from the timeless wisdom found in the Bible:

*"As the scriptures teach, knowledge is a steadfast companion. A person enlightened by wisdom is held in high regard across all realms. The brilliance of education surpasses the allure of beauty and the vigor of youth."*

 With positive energy, let's continue our interactive session and embrace the transformative power of education. So shall we begin ?
30/1/24, 6:53 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: I was anticipating your response today but unfortunately, you were not available all day.

As we embark on a new day, let's reflect on the wisdom from Proverbs 3:5-6 (NIV): *'Trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding; in all your ways submit to him, and he will make your paths straight.'*
31/1/24, 10:13 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: *Good morning Everyone!*

I trust you are doing well. I've observed that my messages have been read but not responded to. In moments of silence, I'm reminded of Psalm 37:7 (NIV): "Be still before the Lord and wait patiently for him." Is everything alright?
1/2/24, 9:55 AM - +263 77 249 1420: We are fine our girl is still weighing options  but very soon she is going to decide
1/2/24, 1:00 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: I empathize with her situation, and as a counselor, I believe I can offer valuable guidance. Being an A-level passout myself, I understand that having multiple questions is genuine. If she is comfortable sharing her A-level results, I can assist her in navigating through the challenges and help identify the best options available to her.

Over the past few days, we've been trying to connect with you to discuss your child's academic journey. We understand the financial commitments involved in providing quality education for your child.
