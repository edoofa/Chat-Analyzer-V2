17/1/24, 11:11 AM - +263 77 280 1613: No please may you continue as you are the one who applied on Takunda 's behalf. That agent was trying to get us from you using the overzealous of the child.
17/1/24, 11:12 AM - +263 77 280 1613: Make everything correct with LPU please
17/1/24, 11:51 AM - Kirti Edoofa: It is alright please @263772801613.

18/1/24, 1:41 PM - +263 77 280 1613: Hello, team Edoofa!!!
24/1/24, 12:57 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Takunda,

I trust you're all having a good day. I want to start by apologizing for my absence over the past week. Unfortunately, I was unwell with a severe ENT infection, which required me to rest as per my doctor's advice. Thankfully, I'm feeling much improved now and am eager to reconnect with you so we can continue our discussions. But before we proceed, I'm curious to hear about how your last week went?
24/1/24, 1:02 PM - +263 77 280 1613: It was a bad week. However I don't think we qualify to be in Edoofa.
24/1/24, 1:15 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am sorry to hear about your bad week, may I know what happened and what makes you think that you do not qualify to be with us?
24/1/24, 1:20 PM - +263 77 280 1613: Your university charges are not of our level. We can't afford $3000 every year without adding food and accommodation.
24/1/24, 1:24 PM - +263 77 280 1613: It was bad cause I am regretting the time, effort and some money I wasted on Edoofa project. Sorry to mention this.
25/1/24, 9:54 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, kindly excuse me for not connecting earlier today I had an emergency visit to my doctor regarding my ENT infection, given that it's been a long day for me, along with the conclusion of our working hours, let's plan to reconnect tomorrow to continue our discussion. I'm optimistic that you'll be able to connect then. Have a great night, and looking forward to our conversation tomorrow.
26/1/24, 6:39 AM - +263 77 280 1613: Do you think Edoofa will be of any help to us?
26/1/24, 12:15 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Takunda.

I hope you are doing well. On the auspicious occasion of Republic Day, I extend my heartfelt greetings to you and your loved ones. Today marks a significant moment in our nation's history, a day when we commemorate the enactment of our Constitution and celebrate the enduring spirit of democracy and unity that defines us as a country.
26/1/24, 12:15 PM - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
26/1/24, 12:15 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I completely understand that you are facing some issues, however, you know despite so many challenges students can complete their admission and reserve their seats with the university and for that, I would like to have a detailed discussion with you so that I can have a better understanding of your challenges so may I know what is a convenient time for you to connect with us?
26/1/24, 12:20 PM - +263 77 280 1613: We can talk now
26/1/24, 12:59 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, please. Considering you've brought this concern to our attention in a timely manner, I believe we can discuss the matter with university officials to explore a solution that prevents Takunda from missing out on this valuable scholarship opportunity. This scholarship serves as the initial stepping stone for her to access higher-quality education and pave the way for a successful career.
26/1/24, 1:00 PM - Kirti Edoofa: To assist you effectively, I would appreciate a more detailed understanding of your situation. This will enable us to align your needs with the university's policies and find a suitable solution. Could you please let me know the exact challenges that you are facing?
26/1/24, 1:04 PM - +263 77 280 1613: We can not afford to pay $1500 every April and $1500 every November of each year. Further more we don't know how much shall be accommodation and food, we need to get visa fees and air ticket. While on the other hand we have other children who should go to school. Our income is little
26/1/24, 5:34 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @263772801613 I completely understand what you are trying to say here and that is the main reason we recommended MVN University to you in the first place because our counseling team shared insights about your requirement with us that you mentioned during the counseling session and that is the reason with careful consideration our admission teams and the board had recommended higher quantum of scholarship to you where accommodation was fully covered. LPU is one of the best universities in India and that is the reason it is even on the expensive side as well.
26/1/24, 5:35 PM - Kirti Edoofa: However, I would still suggest you have a better understanding of the letter first so may I know if you will be available to connect with us today at 06:00 pm CAT to understand the letter in detail?
26/1/24, 8:00 PM - +263 77 280 1613: We wish to work on scholarship of  something like 80% tuition, 100% accommodation and 100% food plan.
27/1/24, 6:38 AM - +263 77 280 1613: I'm sorry I was off line. If you are comfortable,let's talk now
27/1/24, 6:38 AM - +263 77 280 1613: One of the most saddening thing is the misfortune that befall us in mid December 2023. All our income and expected gains got eroded. Therefore we can not afford higher admission fee and higher per annum fees
1/2/24, 9:37 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Takunda

I hope this message finds you well. Please excuse me for not connecting in the past few days, I have been currently dealing with an unexpected family emergency and have taken some time off to provide support to my loved ones during this challenging time and that is why I have not been able to get back to you, however, given that it's been a long day for me, along with the conclusion of our working hours, let's plan to reconnect tomorrow to continue our discussion. I'm optimistic that you'll be able to connect then. Have a great night, and looking forward to our conversation tomorrow.
1/2/24, 10:12 PM - +263 77 280 1613: Thank you, let's try to connect around 4pm.
2/2/24, 6:28 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Takunda.

I hope you are doing well. Since we were not able to continue with our discussion yesterday may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
2/2/24, 6:45 PM - +263 77 280 1613: Yes let's talk
2/2/24, 7:54 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Surely, now I was able to go through the challenge you shared above, and for me to understand this challenge could you please help me understand what particular loss you faced in December 2023 that lead to your expected gains got eroded?
2/2/24, 9:15 PM - +263 77 280 1613: My contract with another company was terminated, and I was expecting to use the funds towards Takunda
2/2/24, 9:15 PM - +263 77 280 1613: Now tell me how will the accommodation and food be according to the offer letter.
2/2/24, 9:15 PM - +263 77 280 1613: So with the scholarship balance versus my family income, it will be difficult to afford the payments unless you bring in other incentives like rising the scholarship percentage on tution, accommodation and food.
2/2/24, 9:15 PM - +263 77 395 9454: Sorry mam was off line tomorrow will be at church so if possible lets connect on Monday
2/2/24, 9:15 PM - +263 77 395 9454: Good evening mam Kirti
2/2/24, 9:42 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your exact challenges, I have taken note of your challenges and will discuss them in detail tomorrow.

Therefore, I'm reaching out today to check if you had a chance to review my previous message and to confirm if we are still in communication?
5/2/24, 4:16 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon parents and Takunda

I hope this message finds you well. I'm circling back regarding the earlier message I shared. While I was anticipating a response, it appears that my messages might not have reached you.

Hence, I'm reaching out today to inquire if you had the opportunity to review my previous message and to confirm if our communication is still ongoing.
5/2/24, 7:04 PM - +263 77 280 1613: How are you, let talk now or tomorrow 4pm
5/2/24, 7:21 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Surely whatever suits you the better, may I know what is more preferable for you?
5/2/24, 7:23 PM - +263 77 280 1613: Tomorrow 4pm   I will be having enough time
