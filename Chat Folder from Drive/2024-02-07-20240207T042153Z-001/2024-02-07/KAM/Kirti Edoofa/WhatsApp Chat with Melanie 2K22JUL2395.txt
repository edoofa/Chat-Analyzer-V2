16/1/24, 11:44 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Melanie,

I trust this message finds you well, and I hope you are in high spirits. In recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their A-Level results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey.
16/1/24, 11:44 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?
16/1/24, 12:00 PM - +263 77 709 7527: Good morning. We are very excited with the results. She managed to meet the minimum requirement. Attached below is the result slip.

Thank you for sharing your results, and congratulations on successfully clearing all your A-Level subjects! Your hard work over the past few months has truly paid off.

I am sure your family is immensely proud of your achievements. Your A-level results have been duly noted, and we will quickly add them to your scholarship application. This will enable us to engage in discussions with the academic board and chart the best course of action for your next steps.
17/1/24, 6:38 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Kindly allow us some time to thoroughly evaluate your results and plan the way forward. Once we have re-evaluated your application, along with all the other applications, we will reconnect with you to discuss the next steps in your academic journey.

I hope this message finds you well. I am *Ms. Kirti, admissions officer here at Edoofa*, filled with the same excitement that's buzzing here at Edoofa! It's that time of the year again when we eagerly anticipate our annual Meet and Greet Seminar in Harare. This event holds a special place in our hearts as it brings us closer to our community, and we're counting down the days with great anticipation!
6/2/24, 8:27 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Just like clockwork, we're gearing up for the seminar next week, and I couldn't resist sharing our enthusiasm with you. Your presence would truly make the event all the more meaningful, guiding you on your journey to India. Hence, with immense joy, we wanted to extend the special invitation for the Meet and Greet Seminar to you and your wonderful family.
6/2/24, 8:27 PM - Kirti Edoofa: And in the process of doing the same, I happened to notice that you haven't started your EWYL Program by now. In light of this, I had a discussion with Ms. Sanjana, the head of the EWYL Department, and I am happy to share that she has graciously agreed to make a special exception for you, expediting your application process.
6/2/24, 8:28 PM - Kirti Edoofa: "As a result, I have gone ahead and created your very own dedicated EWYL Group - *Melanie EWYL22E0520*, adding both you and your parents to the mix. If I have missed including any other family members, they can easily join using the following link: [https://chat.whatsapp.com/Icmcv0XmEIJF1lcuhETdWY].

Within the group, the EWYL team will not only guide you on the hows and whens of the EWYL Program but also share all the exciting details about the upcoming Meet and Greet Seminar in Harare. We are genuinely thrilled to witness you embark on this transformative journey, and we are rooting for your success every step of the way!
