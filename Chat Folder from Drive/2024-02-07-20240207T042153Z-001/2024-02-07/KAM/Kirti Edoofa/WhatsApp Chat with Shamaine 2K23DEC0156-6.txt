29/12/23, 1:39 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That is great. Let us now discuss your university admission process. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts. I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them. 

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
29/12/23, 1:41 PM - +27 62 820 6650: Yes we can start .
29/12/23, 1:43 PM - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/12/23, 1:45 PM - +27 62 820 6650: I have gone through it .
29/12/23, 1:49 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
29/12/23, 1:49 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
29/12/23, 1:55 PM - +27 62 820 6650: Yes ma'am they are .
29/12/23, 1:57 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
29/12/23, 1:58 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
29/12/23, 1:59 PM - +27 62 820 6650: Okay noted
29/12/23, 2:00 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
29/12/23, 2:00 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
29/12/23, 2:01 PM - +27 62 820 6650: They are clear .
29/12/23, 2:02 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
29/12/23, 2:03 PM - +27 62 820 6650: Yes ma'am we can .
29/12/23, 2:03 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
29/12/23, 2:03 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding you are ready, shall we start with our discussion with me individually
29/12/23, 2:03 PM - Kirti Edoofa: For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
29/12/23, 2:10 PM - +27 62 820 6650: I am ready ma'am
29/12/23, 2:11 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, I shall share the videos with you now.

Edoofa invested 10 years of hardwork to identify good schools , colleges and universities for passionate Edoofians.All the schools and universities under Edoofa are prestigious ,a good and safe environment for the students , moreover , students are able to experience vibrant cultures at the schools .Founders encourage students to follow instructions so as to prepare and be qualified for these prestigious institutions.The last video is about the statement of purpose which is an important document that has all information about the students .This document contains the students vision, academic achievements , personality and goals . Students should invest an hour to fill the form that is provided by the admissions office and answer all questions smartly.The statement of purpose enables students to acquire the best scholarship.
29/12/23, 9:05 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding, kindly excuse me for not getting back to you I was occupied in a work meeting. Let me share my views as well so that it will help you expand your understanding.

*Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students:* In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. 

You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent.
29/12/23, 9:05 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s vision for you:* Here our founders talk about the most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
29/12/23, 9:05 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program:* Talking about the third video, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
29/12/23, 9:05 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP:* Another thing is that Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based. 

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
29/12/23, 9:16 PM - +27 62 820 6650: Thank you
I've fully understood.
29/12/23, 9:20 PM - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. Brilliant, Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*.

29/12/23, 9:21 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job.

I wish you a happy new year
29/12/23, 9:36 PM - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome and thank you so much.
29/12/23, 9:50 PM - +27 62 820 6650: You are welcome
29/12/23, 9:50 PM - +27 73 501 5592: Thank you so much. We wish you a happy, prosperous New Year as well. All the guidance is greatly appreciated.
30/12/23, 7:53 PM - +27 62 820 6650: Good evening
30/12/23, 7:54 PM - +27 62 820 6650: <Media omitted>
2/1/24, 12:03 PM - +27 62 820 6650: Question 2 .Is there such a thing as a social structure that constrains individual action , or is society nothing more than a figment of our imagination? 



Social structure refers to institutions and patterns that shape the society.It plays a significant role in enabling and also constraining individual action. The social structure had norms and values that guide individuals in doing what is acceptable and considered appropriate in the society.There are also legal systems for instance laws and regulations that constrain individuals from committing crimes since there are penalties for doing that . Cultural norms and values and also social roles such as those associated with family or work discourage and limits certain behaviors by prescribing specific expectations for how men and women should behave .However, the social structure can also enable individual behavior by providing opportunities for actions . Nevertheless, society is not just a figment of human imaginations .It is a vital and complex system that is shaped by individuals and their actions while individual actions also shape the society. Therefore , social structure does constrain individual action to a greater extent by perpetuating the way people do things the way they have always been done .
2/1/24, 12:03 PM - +27 62 820 6650: Question 3 . Explain the relation between sociology and Economics .


Sociology deals with relationships between humans and society while economics is an age-old institution that is used to deal with the changing patterns in society. There are similarities and differences between Economics and Sociology and one of the similarities is that both sociology and economics both  use scientific methods for studying the society. Another similarity is that both sociology and economics are branches of social science that deal with the study of human development . Economics and sociology are dependent on each other for their study. Economics, as it is mainly concerned with man's economic aspects , is also directly correlated to society's social activities . Similarly , sociology is concerned with the study of social beings , therefore , economic factors highly impact it . Moreover , economics is considered a branch of social science hence ,it's considered to be a branch of sociology . Nonetheless , there are also differences between these two branches for instance sociology is concerned with the social activities of individuals whereas economics is concerned with the individual's economic activities . Thus , sociology primarily studies society and social relationships while economics studies society and wealth . Therefore , sociology and economics have an inter-dependent relationship .
2/1/24, 12:03 PM - +27 62 820 6650: <Media omitted>
2/1/24, 12:06 PM - +27 62 820 6650: Question 4 .What us the role of institutions in society - do they perform positive functions or simply work in the interests of the powerful against the powerless ? 



The role of institutions in society is complex .Some institutions perform positive functions such as maintaining social order , infrastructure and provide essential services thereby promoting the well being of people. Public institutions have a duty of maintaining public safety, examples of the institutions being the army and police .When these institutions work honestly and correctly without corruption, they work in the interests of everyone , thus , they perform positive functions. However, they also work in the interests of the powerful as most are corrupt. The civil government is instituted for the security of everyone but in reality it is instituted for the defense of the rich against the poor . The religious institutions help those in need by giving food and clothes sometimes even shelter and education. Nevertheless, they also stand up for the rich and powerful. These institutions that work in the interests of the powerful are mostly driven by greed of the benefits that come from  taking the side of the powerful rich people. To conclude, institutions perform a bigger role in society as they provide education , protection medical services and other services . Therefore , these institutions do perform positive functions but also work in the interests of the powerful against the powerless to a greater extent .
2/1/24, 1:51 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon parents and Shamaine,

I hope this message finds you in good health and you had a delightful New Year. Thank you for submitting your SOP, the academic interview questions. It is well noted with us, and we have shared the same with the admissions team as well. They will now evaluate your response and will be proceeding to work on them so that your university application is well prepared.
2/1/24, 1:54 PM - +27 62 820 6650: Good afternoon
2/1/24, 2:02 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings. *Now with this, we have completed the second step of your university admission cycle, and hence we will move forward to the third step in your admission journey.*
2/1/24, 2:39 PM - +27 62 820 6650: Question 5 . Explain primary and secondary groups as the two sociological groups and elaborate with examples about in-groups and out-groups as subtypes of primary and secondary groups.


Primary groups are small and made up of individuals who have the most impact on our socialization. They are characterized by close and intimate relationships that last a long time, maybe a lifetime. These relationships are very  personal and contain a lot of emotions .The members typically include family, childhood friends, romantic partners, and members of religious groups who have regular face-to-face or verbal interaction and a shared culture .In primary groups relationships are bound by love ,care , support ,and loyalty .These relationships play important roles in the formation of individuals' sense of self and identity because these people are influential in the development of norms values , beliefs and everyday behaviors . Secondary groups are larger and impersonal .These often have an organized structure , an authority figure who oversees the rules while primary groups are typically informally organized .In secondary groups there are no intimate or close relationships .These groups are functional groups created to carry out a task and achieve goals .A person becomes a member of the secondary voluntarily . Common examples of this group include coworkers at a workplace,students or teachers at a school. In-groups are subtypes of primary groups .They are formed according to race , gender, culture ,age or religion .Out-groups are groups that an individual feels like they don't belong to .An example of an out-group may be a political party that you do not support or a sports team .
2/1/24, 2:45 PM - +27 62 820 6650: Okay ma'am
2/1/24, 2:48 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now before we move ahead, I have a some news to share with you. 

https://chat.whatsapp.com/Hdku83FObPZEm9TChSEzcC

"Use the above-provided link to join your group. Once both you and your parents have joined, please send the following message to the group:

*Dear Mentor, my name is Shamaine Chari, and my EWYL group name is Shamaine EWYL23E1037. I am excited to begin my EWYL Journey. As discussed with the admission team, I am committed to being available on 05/01/2024 to commence the procedures. Kindly schedule my session for the same date so that I can maximize the benefits and start on the right track.*"
2/1/24, 2:49 PM - Kirti Edoofa: "Once you start with the EWYL Program and are able to connect with your mentor, please update the same here as well by sending the below message -

Hello Admission officer, I am now in touch with my EWYL Mentor. The name of my Mentor is _________ and he/she has scheduled my session for ________"
2/1/24, 2:49 PM - +27 62 820 6650: Okay ma'am thank you
2/1/24, 2:52 PM - +27 62 820 6650: Okay noted
2/1/24, 2:52 PM - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. To be on the same page, If I am correct, I believe you want to pursue a bachelor's degree in the course BA (Sociology) for your higher education in India as per the August 2024 intake?
2/1/24, 2:54 PM - +27 62 820 6650: Yes ma'am
2/1/24, 2:55 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation. Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission* Are you ready to start with that?
2/1/24, 2:56 PM - +27 62 820 6650: Yes I am ready.
2/1/24, 3:01 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
2/1/24, 3:01 PM - Kirti Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
2/1/24, 3:01 PM - Kirti Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
2/1/24, 3:01 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
2/1/24, 3:03 PM - +27 62 820 6650: Yes it's not possible
2/1/24, 3:04 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
2/1/24, 3:04 PM - Kirti Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $1000. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
2/1/24, 3:05 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
2/1/24, 3:06 PM - +27 62 820 6650: Yes ma'am we discussed it
2/1/24, 3:07 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
2/1/24, 3:08 PM - +27 62 820 6650: Yes ma'am,we are .
2/1/24, 3:11 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

Tuition Fee: $800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Registration Fee: $1000 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum
*I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?*
2/1/24, 3:16 PM - +27 62 820 6650: I've understood
2/1/24, 3:22 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $1000, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $1000 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
2/1/24, 3:22 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $1000 = $1800. This amount can be paid in two installments of $900 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $900 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
2/1/24, 3:23 PM - +27 62 820 6650: Okay ma'am
2/1/24, 3:24 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
2/1/24, 3:24 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
2/1/24, 3:24 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
2/1/24, 3:25 PM - +27 62 820 6650: Okay ma'am that sounds better
2/1/24, 3:26 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
2/1/24, 3:27 PM - +27 62 820 6650: No ma'am I've understood everything
2/1/24, 3:36 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
2/1/24, 3:36 PM - Kirti Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
2/1/24, 3:37 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
2/1/24, 3:37 PM - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
2/1/24, 3:37 PM - +27 62 820 6650: Yes we are excited
2/1/24, 3:38 PM - +27 62 820 6650: Thank you
2/1/24, 3:39 PM - +27 62 820 6650: This is wonderful
2/1/24, 3:41 PM - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. I hope you are excited to be in this picture for next year's batch?
2/1/24, 3:43 PM - +27 62 820 6650: I am very excited
I just hope that it all works out well .
2/1/24, 3:49 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Indeed it will. I am looking forward to meeting with you. As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
2/1/24, 3:58 PM - +27 62 820 6650: Thank you so much 🙏
2/1/24, 3:59 PM - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
2/1/24, 3:59 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
2/1/24, 4:00 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.*
2/1/24, 4:03 PM - +27 62 820 6650: I have gone through it <This message was edited>
2/1/24, 4:07 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -

*1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of your A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive your letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you would be able to apply for the student visa.
2/1/24, 4:07 PM - Kirti Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same.

This means you, as an Edoofa student, have the prestigious privilege of securing your seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioning yourself as a frontier person in this endeavor.
2/1/24, 4:23 PM - +27 62 820 6650: Okay noted
2/1/24, 4:25 PM - +27 62 820 6650: This is wonderful o
2/1/24, 4:25 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
2/1/24, 4:25 PM - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
2/1/24, 4:25 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
2/1/24, 4:28 PM - +27 62 820 6650: This is wonderful news
2/1/24, 4:29 PM - +27 62 820 6650: Yes ma'am it does
2/1/24, 4:31 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $100 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $1000, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $900.
2/1/24, 4:31 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $1000 fee, you will only be required to pay $900. Once this payment is completed, the entire $1000 amount will be adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $100 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $1000. Does this explanation resonate with you?
2/1/24, 4:33 PM - +27 62 820 6650: Hello Admission officer , I am now in touch with my EWYL Mentor . The name of my Mentor is Ms Ananya and she has scheduled my session for 4 January.
2/1/24, 4:34 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for the update. It's great to hear that you've connected with your EWYL Mentor, Ms. Ananya. I appreciate you sharing the session date with us. 

Please make sure to mark your calendar for the session scheduled date. This mentorship opportunity can provide valuable insights and guidance for her academic and personal development. Wish you all the best!
2/1/24, 4:34 PM - +27 62 820 6650: Yes ma'am.
2/1/24, 4:34 PM - +27 62 820 6650: Thank you ma'am.
2/1/24, 4:48 PM - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome, now coming back to your last benefit. 

*4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
2/1/24, 4:48 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $100 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
2/1/24, 4:48 PM - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for January 10, 2024, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $900, you'll need to make a payment of $450 on or before January 10, 2024. The remaining $450 should be paid by February 10 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
2/1/24, 4:57 PM - +27 62 820 6650: No ma'am I've understood everything
2/1/24, 4:59 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
2/1/24, 5:00 PM - +27 62 820 6650: No ma'am right now I do not have any queries,I've understood everything that you said .
2/1/24, 5:11 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As Shamaine's guardian, I am sure your parents are excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
2/1/24, 5:13 PM - +27 62 820 6650: I am very excited, I can't wait .
2/1/24, 5:14 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to *evaluate your application* after which if they accept your application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
2/1/24, 5:15 PM - +27 62 820 6650: Thank you and have a wonderful night .
6/1/24, 4:40 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Shamaine,

I hope this message finds you well and in good spirits. As I was organizing my day today. In reviewing your scholarship application file, I noticed that there's an outstanding payment of $150 for your Edoofa Enrollment fee due by 1st January 2024. Hence I thought of sharing a gentle reminder about this and checking in to see if you have already made this payment. This will help us to keep your scholarship application file up-to-date and ensure that all is progressing smoothly.
6/1/24, 7:23 PM - +27 62 820 6650: Good evening ma'am
6/1/24, 7:24 PM - +27 62 820 6650: We haven't paid the remaining $150 yet
6/1/24, 7:37 PM - +27 62 820 6650: We are aware of the remaining amount and it will be paid on  the month-end .
8/1/24, 4:10 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Shamaine.

I hope you are doing well. Thank you for letting me know that. May I know what challenges were you facing due to which you were unable to clear the remaining balance on time?
8/1/24, 8:09 PM - +27 62 820 6650: Good evening ma'am
8/1/24, 8:11 PM - +27 62 820 6650: We we're facing challenges of raising all the money at once so we talked about it with Mr Austin and he said the last payment of the enrollment fee should be paid after 30 days.
8/1/24, 8:15 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Yes please which is absolutely correct, and your deadline as per 30 days was on 1st January 2024. I understand that there must be challenges, however, I would appreciate it if you could help me understand your challenges better?
8/1/24, 8:19 PM - +27 62 820 6650: My mother will be  getting the money at the end of the month so right now we do not have the money.
8/1/24, 8:51 PM - +27 76 772 6928: Good Evening Ma'am..this is Sifiso, Shamaine' mom..i Started to be financialy stable in Dec ..I couldn't manage to pay the $350 amount at the same time as have other kids who depend on me too.i work as a Domestic worker and the money is not that much.i will most definitely pay the balance of $150 when I get my salary that is month-end ..I'm very grateful for the Edoofa scholarship as it will help my daughter acquire the education she deserves as I can't afford to give her myself 🙏🙏
8/1/24, 10:11 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings. I would love to continue with our discussion, but since I am not feeling at my best right now, let's plan to reconnect tomorrow to continue our discussion. I'm optimistic that you'll be able to connect then. Have a great night, and looking forward to our conversation tomorrow at 06:00 pm.
10/1/24, 8:07 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, Parents, and Shamaine.

17/1/24, 1:34 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings

In light of the offer letter you received, I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to you and your family on this remarkable achievement in your academic journey.

Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion for you and your family, and I can only imagine the excitement that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.
17/1/24, 1:34 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you have the letter in your possession, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you've had the chance to go through the offer letter thoroughly? 

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
17/1/24, 1:37 PM - +27 62 820 6650: Good afternoon
17/1/24, 1:38 PM - +27 62 820 6650: That is true
17/1/24, 1:38 PM - +27 62 820 6650: Yes ma'am we did go through the letter
17/1/24, 1:42 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As we proceed with today's discussion, we will get into the details of this specific offer letter. I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.
17/1/24, 1:42 PM - Kirti Edoofa: The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
17/1/24, 1:44 PM - +27 62 820 6650: Okay ma'am
17/1/24, 1:45 PM - +27 62 820 6650: Yes ma'am it does 
Thank you
17/1/24, 1:51 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from LPU University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
17/1/24, 1:51 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion -

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission Processing Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4. What’s the Registration fee?
17/1/24, 1:54 PM - +27 62 820 6650: Okay ma'am.thank you
17/1/24, 2:02 PM - +27 62 820 6650: 1. My fees is $975 per semester after the scholarship.
2. The Standard Duration of my course is 3 years 
3. The admission processing fee is $200
4. The registration fee is $700
17/1/24, 2:03 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Yes, that is correct. As you can see in your offer letter, your course is a 3-year-long course, and each year is divided into 2 semesters, this means that you will have 6 semesters in your degree.*

After the scholarship, your per semester tuition fee is $975 making your per annum tuition fee ($975*2) = $1950. Is that clear?
17/1/24, 2:04 PM - +27 62 820 6650: Yes it is clear .
17/1/24, 2:04 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now, Let me also brief you on the two categories of accommodation that are available at LPU -

*1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels inside LPU have different categories. Standard Room with Air Cooler and Standard Room with Air Conditioner with a different number of seaters, the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want.

The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a standard four-seater air cooler room is $1125 and the per annum standard mess/food service fee is $550 and this increases with the type of room/meal plan you choose.
17/1/24, 2:04 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

We also have many students in India who have opted for accommodation outside the LPU campus considering it is more affordable, the cost will be around $1000 per annum and that includes Rent, Food, Wifi Service, and other basic amenities such as water and electricity bills.

The outside accommodations are safe. Students have an option to cook for themselves, along with that they find a community of Edoofians from Africa who are already studying at the same university as them.
17/1/24, 2:08 PM - +27 62 820 6650: Okay the off campus accomodation seems more affordable
17/1/24, 2:11 PM - Kirti Edoofa: This message was deleted
17/1/24, 2:13 PM - +27 62 820 6650: It does  .
17/1/24, 2:15 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Moving forward, as you can see in your offer letter, you have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with the registration fee due as well?
17/1/24, 2:16 PM - +27 62 820 6650: Yes ma'am I am
17/1/24, 2:17 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, it is reassuring to see you following through. Please allow me to share some great news with you. As you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300, mentioned in the letter, has been entirely waived under the Early Registration Scheme and the Endowment Plan. This means it will not be added to your overall cost of education.
17/1/24, 2:17 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on January 30 2024*. I hope we are together so far?
17/1/24, 2:18 PM - +27 62 820 6650: Okay
17/1/24, 2:19 PM - +27 62 820 6650: Yes ma'am we are
17/1/24, 2:24 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $100 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
17/1/24, 2:25 PM - +27 62 820 6650: Yes ma'am
17/1/24, 2:26 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $100 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $650  of the registration fee. This $650 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$325 before the first deadline date of January 30, 2024* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$325  before the second deadline date of February 29, 2024* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
17/1/24, 2:26 PM - Kirti Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $650 within 15 working days, before *January 30, 2024*. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
17/1/24, 2:28 PM - +27 62 820 6650: Okay ma'am
17/1/24, 2:28 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
17/1/24, 2:28 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
17/1/24, 2:29 PM - +27 62 820 6650: No I am currently in South Africa.
17/1/24, 2:30 PM - +27 62 820 6650: But when I am in Zimbabwe I stay in Masvingo
17/1/24, 2:30 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
17/1/24, 2:30 PM - Kirti Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
17/1/24, 2:30 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
17/1/24, 2:33 PM - +27 62 820 6650: Okay ma'am thank you
17/1/24, 2:33 PM - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
17/1/24, 2:33 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Charles FBC Bank for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
17/1/24, 2:36 PM - +27 62 820 6650: Yes ma'am
17/1/24, 2:36 PM - +27 62 820 6650: You can give me the account details.
17/1/24, 2:37 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Let me do the same. If making the payment through Mr. Charle’s is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

Account Holder - Charles Jerera
Account Number - 5333 0380 1404 8828
Bank Name - FBC Bank Limited 
Branch - Masvingo
17/1/24, 2:38 PM - +27 62 820 6650: Okay ma'am thank you
17/1/24, 2:38 PM - Kirti Edoofa: This message was deleted
17/1/24, 2:40 PM - +27 62 820 6650: Okay ma'am this is well noted
17/1/24, 2:41 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to see that you were able to follow through with our last message. Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $2800, let me also guide you on how we can make your education more affordable.
17/1/24, 2:41 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
17/1/24, 2:41 PM - Kirti Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn.
17/1/24, 2:41 PM - Kirti Edoofa: The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. I hope you have understood this?
17/1/24, 2:43 PM - +27 62 820 6650: I have understood it very well
17/1/24, 2:49 PM - Kirti Edoofa: With this said, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that you with your hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.
17/1/24, 2:49 PM - Kirti Edoofa: With these earned credits, you can use this $1000 to cover a portion of your annual fee, which is $2800. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $2800 - $1000 = $1800, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.
17/1/24, 2:49 PM - Kirti Edoofa: This illustrates how you can effectively make your education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
17/1/24, 2:52 PM - +27 62 820 6650: Yes ma'am it does
17/1/24, 2:56 PM - Kirti Edoofa: It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education while balancing your academics. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.
17/1/24, 2:56 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now, that you have all the details with you and understand the letter better, I would like to enquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
17/1/24, 3:00 PM - +27 62 820 6650: I will be dedicated towards the EWYL
17/1/24, 3:02 PM - +27 76 772 6928: Afternoon Ma'am,my name is Sifiso Mdlawuzo,I'm Shamaine' Chari's mother and her guardian.. thank you for taking us the letter,Yu have explained everything very well and we understood it all..May you please change her guardian to my name not Tawanda Chari
17/1/24, 3:05 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that, we have taken note of the same, after you complete your registration process when the university will share your official admission acceptance letter we will ask the university to update the same in that.
17/1/24, 3:05 PM - +27 76 772 6928: 🙏 thank you so much
17/1/24, 3:08 PM - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome, @27767726928 may I know if you are available for a 15-minute-long discussion again I just noticed that there has been a technical error and a message for the other student has been shared with you. I hope you understand as we talk to many students at a time so?
17/1/24, 3:10 PM - +27 76 772 6928: It is well no problem
17/1/24, 3:10 PM - Kirti Edoofa: so may I know if you are clear so far with the accommodation of Lovely Professional University?
17/1/24, 3:11 PM - +27 76 772 6928: Everything is clear and well noted
17/1/24, 3:11 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. If you decide to stay on campus, the university officials will help you settle and will be taking responsibility for your well-being, our per annum accommodation cost will be $1675.

However, if a student doesn’t wish to stay on campus and is looking for more affordable accommodation options, in that case, they can go with the off-campus accommodation where their per annum cost would be around $1000 including the food cost and they can also cook food for themselves.
17/1/24, 3:11 PM - Kirti Edoofa: For the off-campus accommodation, you can connect with any of the Edoofians staying off-campus, and he/she would help you look for the off-campus accommodation options. If you are not connected with any students, we will help you connect with them near your time of arrival so that they can help you with the off-campus accommodation options.

*LPU never forces anyone to choose the Hostel, they ask them to visit the campus, check for themselves, and then decide whether he/she wants to stay inside or outside the campus. Are you clear on this?* <This message was edited>
17/1/24, 3:13 PM - +27 76 772 6928: Well noted thanks
17/1/24, 3:13 PM - +27 62 820 6650: Ma'am I'd like to know if we are going to receive more offer letters since you said you will be applying to 5 different schools.
17/1/24, 3:13 PM - Kirti Edoofa: You also have the examination fee of $75 which is due every semester, and the health insurance fee. A Medical Health Insurance policy is mandatory for all international students and they can get it from the university itself and it would cost them $50 per annum subject to yearly revision.

If God forbids and something happens to you during your higher education, you would be protected from the financial risks or uncertainties that arise due to a medical emergency. I hope you are clear about this?
17/1/24, 3:14 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Yes please, I will come back to your concern once we complete our letter discussion.
17/1/24, 3:15 PM - +27 76 772 6928: Yes ma'am
17/1/24, 3:15 PM - +27 62 820 6650: Okay ma'am thank you
17/1/24, 3:16 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $700 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on  January 30th, 2024*. I hope we are together so far?
17/1/24, 3:18 PM - +27 76 772 6928: Yes ma'am,I have been following your discussion with Shamaine
17/1/24, 3:21 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $100 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
17/1/24, 3:23 PM - +27 76 772 6928: Yes I do thank you.. please do
17/1/24, 3:23 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $100 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $600 of the registration fee. This $600 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:
1. An initial payment of *$300 before the first deadline date of January 30th, 2024* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).
2. A subsequent payment of *$300 before the second deadline date of February 29th, 2024* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
17/1/24, 3:24 PM - Kirti Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $600 within 15 working days, before January 30, 2023. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
17/1/24, 3:25 PM - +27 76 772 6928: Very clear ma'am
17/1/24, 3:26 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now I am sure you must be clear about the payment modes I have shared above with you?
17/1/24, 3:27 PM - +27 76 772 6928: Yes ma'am,I saw there are 2 of them
17/1/24, 3:28 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. Now that you know your per annum educational expenses for your education abroad, let me also help you understand how you can make your education more affordable.

Ideally, the complete per annum fee is to be paid by the student, however, for students under the Edoofa Program, they have an additional opportunity of the EWYL Program. Because of that, you as a student can earn $800 to $1200 worth of scholarship credits in a year and use them to pay a part of your fee.
17/1/24, 3:28 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I would also like to inform you that the above range shared does not mean that a student can earn credits only up to $1200. There is no upper limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits.

In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his or her higher education, he/she can earn accordingly. Are you clear on this?
17/1/24, 3:29 PM - +27 76 772 6928: That's wonderful news
17/1/24, 3:29 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now, do you have any queries that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
17/1/24, 3:31 PM - +27 76 772 6928: As far as you have explained everything it is well understood...Yu can.share about the University insight
17/1/24, 3:41 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Let me also share a few insights into the university with you -
17/1/24, 3:41 PM - Kirti Edoofa: LPU is one of the best universities in India and it has been ranked in the top 80 universities worldwide, because of its international tie-ups, the exposure a student gets at the university is indomitable. 

It has a campus of 800 acres, with over 100,000 students studying from all over the world. Students from LPU are placed at Microsoft, Google, IMF, Work Bank, and many more. It has spent a lot of money building the infrastructure so that a quality service can be given to the students.
17/1/24, 3:41 PM - Kirti Edoofa: The students at LPU are not only looking for Academics but holistic development is given the utmost importance. The students there can join clubs to represent the University in various competitions like MUN, Debate, and Sports along with various other activities.

As you can not visit the campus and see it for yourself, in that case, you can take a virtual tour of the campus, it is open 24/7 and is never off. Here is the link for the same - https://www.lpu.in/virtual-tour/
17/1/24, 3:41 PM - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
17/1/24, 3:41 PM - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
17/1/24, 3:42 PM - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
17/1/24, 3:42 PM - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
17/1/24, 3:43 PM - Kirti Edoofa: These resources are designed to help you familiarize yourself with the university and its academic environment, even when physical visits are not possible.
17/1/24, 3:44 PM - +27 76 772 6928: Thank you so much, taking a look at them
17/1/24, 3:46 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am happy to hear that, before we conclude our conversation for today, I would like to emphasize the importance of sharing your offer letter with your family and engaging in a detailed discussion with them to ensure they have a clear understanding of its contents.
17/1/24, 3:46 PM - Kirti Edoofa: This is undoubtedly an exciting moment for you and your family, as you have received a scholarship offer from an Indian university, bringing you one step closer to realising your dream of pursuing education abroad.
17/1/24, 3:46 PM - Kirti Edoofa: As you have your conversation, I recommend keeping a record of any questions or concerns that arise. This will enable us to have a comprehensive discussion during our next scheduled meeting which will be on Friday that is 19th Jan. We can address any queries you may have and outline the next steps for your admission process. I hope this sounds good to you?
17/1/24, 3:47 PM - +27 62 820 6650: Okay ma'am thank you
17/1/24, 3:47 PM - +27 62 820 6650: Yes ma'am it does.
Thank you 👏
17/1/24, 3:48 PM - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome, now coming on to your concern @27628206650. Let me address this query of yours by helping you understand how a student's university admission process is carried out.
17/1/24, 3:48 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Scholarship Program is a merit-based scholarship, and hence a student's application is shared with multiple universities that are recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board after considering a student's eligibility, along with the university's ranking and affordability.
17/1/24, 3:48 PM - Kirti Edoofa: After we share the application with the universities, it is on the admissions team of the university to accept or reject an application, and the decision to offer a scholarship depends on them. If you have any university on your mind, you can let me know and we will surely look into your inclinations as well.
17/1/24, 3:48 PM - +27 62 820 6650: Yes I am aware
17/1/24, 3:48 PM - Kirti Edoofa: As of now, your application has been only accepted by the LPU and since we have shared your application with multiple universities, we are also hoping to receive updates from multiple universities. Once we get the same, we will surely inform you, but each university takes its own time to consider the application and so you have to be patient while the universities are evaluating the application. 

I hope you are clear about this now?
17/1/24, 3:49 PM - +27 62 820 6650: Yes I am
17/1/24, 3:49 PM - +27 62 820 6650: Thank you ma'am
17/1/24, 3:50 PM - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. As you know that each university takes its own time to evaluate an application, In that case, if you wish to wait for an update from let us say University A and end up missing the opportunity given by LPU, you would lose out on the scholarship from LPU and won't be able to join it in the future. 

To help you with that, there is a transfer option available to the students. Are you aware of that?
17/1/24, 3:51 PM - +27 62 820 6650: No I'm not
17/1/24, 3:53 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you understand about the Transfer Option better -

Without any worries/concerns, you can go ahead and reserve your scholarship seat with LPU by paying your registration fee due. 

If and when in the future, you get a better scholarship offer and wish to change your university, in that case, you would have the opportunity to change your university without paying any additional amount of money.

If you do not get a better scholarship offer, in that case, you will be able to pursue your education at LPU without risking losing out on the scholarship.
17/1/24, 3:54 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you understand it with an example as well - 

Let us say you have paid $700 to LPU to reserve your seat with the university and after that, you get a better offer from University A where your registration fee is again $700.

If you wish to change your university to University A, in that case, one is to pay $700, but because you would have already paid $700 for LPU, the same amount would be adjusted against your fee of $700 at University A and so you will not have to pay any other additional of money to reserve your scholarship seat with University or to change your university. 

I hope you are clear with this and have a better understanding?
17/1/24, 3:58 PM - +27 62 820 6650: Okay ma'am this is helpful
17/1/24, 3:59 PM - +27 62 820 6650: I have understood it fully
17/1/24, 4:01 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, let us reconnect on Friday I hope you have a blessed day ahead.
17/1/24, 4:02 PM - +27 62 820 6650: Thank you ma'am
Have a wonderful night
17/1/24, 4:03 PM - +27 76 772 6928: Thank you so much.. you too
24/1/24, 4:45 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Shamaine,

I hope this message finds you all well and in high spirits. I apologize for not being in touch over the past few days. Unfortunately, I was dealing with a significant ENT infection and needed to follow my doctor's recommendation for rest, which meant taking some time off to prioritize my health. As a result, I was unable to inform you about my temporary absence. Thankfully, I'm feeling considerably better now and am ready to resume our interactions. Before we proceed with our discussion, I'd like to catch up - how have you and your family been lately?
24/1/24, 6:35 PM - +27 62 820 6650: Good evening ma'am I'm glad you are feeling better now
24/1/24, 8:51 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for your concern, since we were unable to connect on the 19th of Jan so let us plan to connect tomorrow at 02:00 pm CAT so that we can go through any queries that you still have. I hope you will be available tomorrow have a blessed day ahead.
24/1/24, 8:54 PM - +27 62 820 6650: I will be available
24/1/24, 8:54 PM - +27 62 820 6650: Have a good night
26/1/24, 2:36 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Shamaine!

I hope you are doing well and I find you in high spirits. After our previous discussion, I am sure you and your family were filled with anticipation regarding the offer letter. 

Receiving the university's offer letter is indeed a significant milestone, and I can imagine the excitement that must have accompanied the anticipation of this moment.

Looking forward, I would like to enquire if you and your family had an opportunity to review and discuss the offer letter as a collective?
26/1/24, 2:39 PM - +27 76 772 6928: Afternoon Ma'am.yes we did thank you
26/1/24, 2:40 PM - +27 76 772 6928: Unfortunately the fees are too high for me as I have other responsibilities.
26/1/24, 2:58 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @27767726928 I completely understand that you might feel that the amount to be raised is high however, for now, you only have to focus on the $650 for Shamaine to register with the university which can also be paid in two installments of $325 each so I am not able to understand what is the challenge that you are exactly facing, maybe you can help me understand better?
26/1/24, 3:08 PM - +27 76 772 6928: The annual university fees  ma'am.. according to the calculations we are looking at $2.8, annual of which it is too high for me
26/1/24, 3:51 PM - Kirti Edoofa: May I know what particular cost are you finding expensive during the time of your counseling sessions, you were well informed that your education will be within the range of $2000-$3000 including your accommodation and food as well, as the annual fee of $2800 includes accommodation, food and tuition fee as well, maybe you can help me understand better?
29/1/24, 9:40 AM - +27 62 820 6650: Good morning
29/1/24, 9:46 AM - +27 62 820 6650: I'd like to know if there's another way we can use to pay the registration fee but from South Africa.
30/1/24, 7:29 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good Evening parents and Shamaine,

I hope you are doing well, and thank you for sharing the query about the payment mode from South Africa. In case you are planning to make the payment from South Africa, the best, most reliable, and affordable payment mode is Mama Money. May I know if you are aware of this mode? If yes, would you like to make the payment using Mama Money?
31/1/24, 4:43 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good Afternoon, Parents and Sharmaine,

I hope this message finds you well. I was expecting a response from your end yesterday, but unfortunately, we did not receive any. Therefore, I wanted to reach out to you once again to ensure that you have had the opportunity to go through my previous messages and confirm if we are still connected?
31/1/24, 4:47 PM - +27 76 772 6928: Good afternoon ma'am,my apologies for not responding..I thought Shamaine had shared with you the receipt of the registration fee I promised to pay before 31st.. it was payed on the 29th
31/1/24, 4:50 PM - +27 76 772 6928: Regarding this message,,yes it was well explained and very mu 4 understood..I'm trying to raise the Registration fees hoping that we will get another offer in another University with lower fees
31/1/24, 4:59 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for the update, @27767726928. I am glad to hear that you were able to make the payment of the fee on the 29th. Could you please share the payment receipt with us? This will allow us to update the accounts team and confirm the payment against Sharmaine's application accordingly.
31/1/24, 5:00 PM - +27 76 772 6928: It is well,I will inform Shamaine to do so as she is the one with the receipt.. right now she is facing load shedding

31/1/24, 5:07 PM - +27 62 820 6650: <Media omitted>
31/1/24, 5:09 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the receipt for the payment. However, if I am correct, this receipt is for the payment of the remaining Edoofa Enrollment Fee that Sharmaine had and not for the university registration fee, is that correct?
31/1/24, 5:11 PM - +27 62 820 6650: Yes ma'am
31/1/24, 5:11 PM - +27 62 820 6650: Is it possible for the university to give us more days
31/1/24, 5:34 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Oh well, If I am understanding you correctly, it seems you haven't been able to make the payment of your fee by now? May I inquire about what happened? Were you facing any challenges that prevented you from making the payment of your fee in a timely manner and by when are you planning to make the deposit so that I can update the academic board as well?
31/1/24, 6:06 PM - +27 62 820 6650: So far we haven't been able to raise the money but we are hoping that we can raise it this month upcoming month .
1/2/24, 7:39 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Shamaine.

I hope you are doing well. I completely understand that however, for me to assist you I would need to understand what particular challenge are you facing due to which you haven not been able to raise the money by now?
1/2/24, 10:45 PM - +27 62 820 6650: Good evening ma'am, I hope you are all well .We still had to pay the outstanding balance of the enrollment fee and so we paid it  since we had to pay it first . However,my mother could not raise the admission fee as there are other children who look up to her as well and they also needed some necessities.Right now she is trying to raise the admission fee so that we can pay it and the challenge we face is that she's only one parent who has to do this on her own .We were also hoping to get another offer letter that is cheaper or has a higher scholarship.
2/2/24, 7:13 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Shamaine.

I hope you are doing well. Since we were not able to continue with our discussion yesterday may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
2/2/24, 7:15 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for asking, I am doing fine. I completely understand the challenges you are going through and regarding your concern about another offer letter. Let me address this query of yours by helping you understand how a student's university admission process is carried out.
2/2/24, 7:15 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Scholarship Program is a merit-based scholarship, and hence a student's application is shared with multiple universities that are recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board after considering a student's eligibility, along with the university's ranking and affordability.
2/2/24, 7:15 PM - Kirti Edoofa: After we share the application with the universities, it is on the admissions team of the university to accept or reject an application, and the decision to offer a scholarship depends on them. If you have any university on your mind, you can let me know and we will surely look into your inclinations as well.
2/2/24, 7:16 PM - Kirti Edoofa: As of now, your application has been only accepted by the LPU and since we have shared your application with multiple universities, we are also hoping to receive updates from multiple universities. Once we get the same, we will surely inform you, but each university takes its own time to consider the application and so you have to be patient while the universities are evaluating the application. 

I hope you are clear about this now?
2/2/24, 7:22 PM - +27 62 820 6650: Good evening ma'am
2/2/24, 7:26 PM - +27 62 820 6650: Yes ma'am I've understood
2/2/24, 7:30 PM - Kirti Edoofa: As you know that each university takes its own time to evaluate an application, In that case, if you wish to wait for an update from let us say University A and end up missing the opportunity given by LPU, you would lose out on the scholarship from LPU and won't be able to join it in the future. 

To help you with that, there is a transfer option available to the students. Are you aware of that?
2/2/24, 7:32 PM - +27 62 820 6650: Can you tell.me more about the transfer option
2/2/24, 7:34 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you understand about the Transfer Option better -

Without any worries/concerns, you can go ahead and reserve your scholarship seat with LPU by paying your registration fee due. 

If and when in the future, you get a better scholarship offer and wish to change your university, in that case, you would have the opportunity to change your university without paying any additional amount of money.

If you do not get a better scholarship offer, in that case, you will be able to pursue your education at LPU without risking losing out on the scholarship. <This message was edited>
2/2/24, 7:35 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you understand it with an example as well - 

Let us say you have paid $700 to LPU to reserve your seat with the university and after that, you get a better offer from University A where your registration fee is again $700.

If you wish to change your university to University A, in that case, one is to pay $700, but because you would have already paid $700 for LPU, the same amount would be adjusted against your fee of $700 at University A and so you will not have to pay any other additional of money to reserve your scholarship seat with University or to change your university. 

I hope you are clear with this and have a better understanding?
2/2/24, 7:36 PM - +27 62 820 6650: Yes ma'am I am now
2/2/24, 7:37 PM - +27 62 820 6650: So is it possible for us to get more days to pay the registration fee
2/2/24, 7:38 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that now coming to your concern regarding the challenges you are having for me to assist you better I would like to know the exact challenge due to which you are not able to raise the registration fee by now?
2/2/24, 7:40 PM - +27 62 820 6650: I thought my father was going to help pay for the registration fee but he isn't going to help so this means that my mother is supposed to raise the money alone .However last month was her first month to work since he wasn't working for long so we had to pay the enrollment fee first before the registration fee.
2/2/24, 7:49 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing that. If you do not think it is too much to ask could you please help me understand how much your parents get paid, I understand that it can be a personal question so if you wish to respond to the same over the personal window you can do that?
6/2/24, 6:53 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Shamaine,

6/2/24, 7:14 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please.
