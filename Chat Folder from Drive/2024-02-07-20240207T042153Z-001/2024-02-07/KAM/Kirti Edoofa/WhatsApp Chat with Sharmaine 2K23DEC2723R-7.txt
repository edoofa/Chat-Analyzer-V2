15/1/24, 1:19 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I understand that, however, it has been a long time. When we started your admission process initially our aim was to complete the process within 4 days, however, due to the delays we have not even reached the first step in your admission cycle, with the speed we are moving ahead I am afraid to say this but you are lacking behind your peers, even your EWYL program that you were supposed to start tomorrow will not be possible because of the delays we had from your end. I would please encourage you to be more proactive as we have a new EWYL batch upcoming on the 23rd of January.
15/1/24, 1:26 PM - +263 77 845 9792: Noted thank you. Sorry for the delay hopefully it will be done by end of the day

I trust you're all having a good day. I want to start by apologizing for my absence over the past week.

Last week after filling out the admission form and submitting it to you. We awaited for your response on the next steps after that. Unfortunately because of the illness you couldn't connect
24/1/24, 5:13 PM - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome and thank you for your concern I feel much better now. Excuse me for all the inconvenience caused because I was not able to update you about my health. I hope you understand?
24/1/24, 5:20 PM - +263 77 845 9792: Sure it's understandable. Hoping to proceed with the process because you had said she can start EWYL today but because of non progress l think you are going to slot a future date
24/1/24, 9:34 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Surely I will. I would love to continue with our conversation however, given that it's been a long day for me, along with the conclusion of our working hours, let's plan to reconnect tomorrow to continue our discussion. I'm optimistic that you'll be able to connect then. Have a great night, and looking forward to our conversation tomorrow.
25/1/24, 12:06 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Sharmaine.

1/2/24, 12:20 PM - +263 71 135 5910: Good afternoon everyone

1/2/24, 1:51 PM - +263 77 845 9792: Yes we are available
1/2/24, 2:07 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. The new EWYL Batch starts on the 6th of February 2024, so before we move ahead I would like you to please share the updated EWYL pledge from.
1/2/24, 2:12 PM - +263 77 845 9792: Ok let me tell her to send
1/2/24, 2:15 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Surely I shall wait for an update from your end. In the meantime. Let us now discuss your university admission process. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts. I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them. 

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
1/2/24, 2:24 PM - +263 77 845 9792: Please go ahead
1/2/24, 2:24 PM - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
1/2/24, 2:34 PM - +263 77 845 9792: Noted please explain the steps in detail
1/2/24, 2:36 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
1/2/24, 2:36 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
1/2/24, 2:59 PM - +263 71 135 5910: Noted
1/2/24, 3:06 PM - +263 71 135 5910: <Media omitted>
1/2/24, 3:27 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the updated from, may I know if you are clear so far?
1/2/24, 3:34 PM - +263 77 845 9792: So far so good
1/2/24, 3:34 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
1/2/24, 3:34 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
1/2/24, 3:37 PM - +263 71 135 5910: Thank you
1/2/24, 3:37 PM - +263 71 135 5910: Thank you once again
1/2/24, 3:38 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process, the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
1/2/24, 3:38 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?

1/2/24, 3:41 PM - +263 71 135 5910: Yes it's OK Ms Kirti, we can proceed
1/2/24, 4:19 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
1/2/24, 4:19 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding until you are ready, shall we start with our discussion with me individually?
1/2/24, 4:34 PM - +263 71 135 5910: Yes Ms Kirti

I hope you are doing well. By the time you responded it was past our available hours so we could not get back to you. Thank you for sharing your understanding. Let me share my views as well so that it will help you expand your understanding.

*Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students:* In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. 

You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent.
5/2/24, 12:10 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s vision for you:* Here our founders talk about the most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
5/2/24, 12:10 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program:* Talking about the third video, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
5/2/24, 12:11 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP:* Another thing is that Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based. 

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.

5/2/24, 4:10 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by tomorrow 01:30 PM.
5/2/24, 4:10 PM - Kirti Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded.
