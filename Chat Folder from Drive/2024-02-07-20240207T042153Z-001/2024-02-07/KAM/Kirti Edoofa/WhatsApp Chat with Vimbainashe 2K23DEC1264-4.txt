I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them. 

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
27/12/23, 1:26 PM - +263 71 577 9523: Yes ma'am I'm ready
27/12/23, 1:26 PM - +263 71 577 9523: Let's start
27/12/23, 1:27 PM - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
27/12/23, 1:28 PM - +263 71 577 9523: I've gone through it ma'am
27/12/23, 1:30 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
27/12/23, 1:30 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
27/12/23, 1:34 PM - +263 71 577 9523: Yes ma'am they are clear
27/12/23, 1:42 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
27/12/23, 1:42 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
27/12/23, 1:46 PM - +263 71 577 9523: Yes ma'am I'm following
27/12/23, 1:48 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
27/12/23, 1:48 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
27/12/23, 1:49 PM - +263 71 577 9523: Yes they are clear ma'am
27/12/23, 1:50 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
27/12/23, 1:55 PM - +263 71 577 9523: Yes ma'am let's start
27/12/23, 1:58 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
27/12/23, 1:58 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding you are ready, shall we start with our discussion with me individually
27/12/23, 1:58 PM - Kirti Edoofa: For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
27/12/23, 2:04 PM - +263 71 577 9523: Yes let's move forward
27/12/23, 2:06 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, I shall share the videos with you now.

*Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students:* In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. 

You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent.
27/12/23, 3:27 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s vision for you:* Here our founders talk about the most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
27/12/23, 3:28 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program:* Talking about the third video, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
27/12/23, 3:28 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP:* Another thing is that Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based. 

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
27/12/23, 3:34 PM - +263 71 577 9523: Thank you ma'am

27/12/23, 3:38 PM - +263 71 577 9523: Yes ma'am
27/12/23, 3:40 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by tomorrow 01:30 PM.
27/12/23, 3:40 PM - Kirti Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded.

27/12/23, 4:15 PM - +263 71 577 9523: Oky ma'am thank you
28/12/23, 10:19 AM - +263 71 577 9523: 2:The relationship between entrepreneurship and economic development is a very important one! Entrepreneurship is often seen as the engine of economic growth, because it creates jobs, stimulates innovation, and boosts productivity. In addition, entrepreneurs often bring new ideas, technologies, and products to the market, which can help spur economic development. At the same time, a strong economy can encourage more people to start their own businesses, which in turn helps the economy grow even further. It's a cycle that benefits everyone involved. I'd like to talk about two other factors that are related to the relationship between entrepreneurship and economic development: risk-taking and innovation. Entrepreneurs often take risks in order to start and grow their businesses, and this risk-taking can lead to innovation, which in turn leads to economic growth. It's a virtuous cycle that can be very beneficial to society as a whole. Without entrepreneurs, we might not have some of the amazing technologies and products that we enjoy today, like smartphones, social media, or ride-sharing apps. So it's clear that entrepreneurship is closely tied to economic development..

 Another important aspect of the relationship between entrepreneurship and economic development is the role of government. Governments often provide incentives and support for entrepreneurs, such as tax breaks, funding opportunities, and business incubators. This support can help entrepreneurs to succeed, and in turn, boost economic development. At the same time, governments can also create regulations and policies that make it harder for entrepreneurs to start and grow their businesses. So it's a delicate balance, and governments must be careful not to stifle innovation while still providing support for entrepreneurs. 

3:GAAP stands for Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, and it's a set of rules and guidelines that accountants follow when preparing financial statements. GAAP is important because it helps to ensure that financial statements are prepared consistently and accurately, so that they can be used to make informed decisions about a company's financial health. Without GAAP, there would be no standard way to measure and report financial information, which could lead to confusion and even fraud. GAAP also helps to ensure that companies are disclosing all of the relevant information about their financial health to investors, regulators, and other interested parties.


Another important reason why GAAP is important is that it helps to create trust in the financial system. When companies are held to a high standard of accounting and reporting, it gives investors and other stakeholders confidence in the financial system as a whole. Without GAAP, there would be less transparency and confidence in the financial system, which could lead to instability and even crises. In short, GAAP is vital for ensuring the smooth functioning of the financial system.

4: Accounting standards are the specific rules and principles that govern how financial statements are prepared. These standards are typically set by a governing body, such as the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) in the United States. Accounting standards are mandatory because they help to ensure that all companies are using the same methods to prepare their financial statements. This allows for comparisons between companies and helps to ensure that financial statements are reliable and consistent. Without accounting standards, there would be no way to ensure that financial statements are fair and accurate.

 The other important things to understand about accounting standards is that they are constantly evolving. As the economy and business world changes, so do the rules that govern financial reporting.Financial Accounting Standards Board(FASB), for example, regularly reviews and updates its standards to reflect changes in the marketplace. This ensures that accounting standards are always relevant and effective. 

In addition, it's important to note that different countries have their own sets of accounting standards. For example, the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) are used by many countries around the world. However, the U.S. still uses GAAP for most publicly traded companies


5: Accounting and auditing are two closely related, but distinct activities. Accounting refers to the process of preparing and reporting financial information, while auditing is the process of verifying and evaluating that financial information. In other words, accounting is the process of recording and reporting financial transactions, while auditing is the process of checking that the information reported is accurate and reliable. Both activities are important in maintaining financial transparency and integrity.Accounting provides the data, and auditing ensures that the data is reliable.

Accounting as the "back-end" of a company's financial reporting, while auditing is the "front-end." Accounting is the day-to-day process of recording transactions, maintaining records, and preparing financial statements. Auditing, on the other hand, is the process of independently assessing the accuracy and reliability of those financial statements. Auditing often takes place after the accounting is done, as a way to verify the information that has been reported. Auditors may also provide recommendations for improving accounting procedures and internal controls.

They will now evaluate your response and will be proceeding to work on them so that your university application is well prepared.
28/12/23, 1:24 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Now with this, we have completed the second step of your university admission cycle, and hence we will move forward to the third step in your admission journey.*
28/12/23, 1:25 PM - +263 71 577 9523: Oky ma'am thank you
28/12/23, 1:42 PM - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome, before we move ahead I have a news to share with you. 

https://chat.whatsapp.com/Bj2DlCItufZHWHH7SNNeZv

"Use the above-provided link to join your group. Once both you and your parents have joined, please send the following message to the group:

*Dear Mentor, my name is Mutize Vimbainashe, and my EWYL group name is Vimbainashe EWYL23E1064. I am excited to begin my EWYL Journey.

Kindly schedule my session for the same date so that I can maximize the benefits and start on the right track.*"
28/12/23, 1:42 PM - Kirti Edoofa: "Once you start with the EWYL Program and are able to connect with your mentor, please update the same here as well by sending the below message -

Hello Admission officer, I am now in touch with my EWYL Mentor. The name of my Mentor is _________ and he/she has scheduled my session for ________"
28/12/23, 1:46 PM - +263 71 577 9523: Oky ma'am
28/12/23, 1:50 PM - Kirti Edoofa: To be on the same page, If I am correct, I believe you want to pursue a bachelor's degree in the course BCom for your higher education in India as per the August 2024 intake?
28/12/23, 1:51 PM - +263 71 577 9523: Yes ma'am that's correct
28/12/23, 1:52 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation. Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission* Are you ready to start with that?
28/12/23, 1:52 PM - +263 71 577 9523: Yes ma'am I'm ready
28/12/23, 1:56 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
28/12/23, 1:56 PM - Kirti Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
28/12/23, 1:56 PM - Kirti Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
28/12/23, 1:56 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
28/12/23, 2:15 PM - +263 71 577 9523: Yes ma'am
28/12/23, 2:19 PM - +263 71 577 9523: Hello Admission officer, I am now in touch with my EWYL Mentor. The name of my Mentor is _Ms Saloni  and she has scheduled my session for _1 hour
28/12/23, 2:28 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for the update. It's great to hear that you've connected with your EWYL Mentor, Ms. Saloni. I appreciate you sharing the session time with us. 

Please make sure to mark your calendar for the session scheduled. This mentorship opportunity can provide valuable insights and guidance for her academic and personal development. Wish you all the best!
28/12/23, 2:28 PM - +263 71 577 9523: Thank you ma'am
28/12/23, 2:47 PM - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
28/12/23, 2:47 PM - Kirti Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $1000. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process
28/12/23, 2:47 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
28/12/23, 2:49 PM - +263 71 577 9523: Yes ma'am he did
28/12/23, 2:51 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $1200 to $1800 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
28/12/23, 2:52 PM - +263 71 577 9523: Yes ma'am
28/12/23, 2:52 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

Tuition Fee: $350 per annum
Accommodation Fee: $0 per annum (100% Sponsorship)
Miscellaneous Fee: $1000
Registration Fee: $1000 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $350 + Accommodation Fee $0 + Miscellaneous Fee $1000 = $1350 per annum

*I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?*
28/12/23, 2:53 PM - +263 71 577 9523: Yes ma'am
28/12/23, 3:03 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $1000, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $1000 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $1350 as per the above example. Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $1350 - $1000 = $350. This amount can be paid within the first three days of your arrival in India.
28/12/23, 3:06 PM - +263 71 577 9523: Yes ma'am
28/12/23, 3:06 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
28/12/23, 3:06 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
28/12/23, 3:06 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
28/12/23, 3:46 PM - +263 71 577 9523: Oky maam I understand
28/12/23, 3:46 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
28/12/23, 3:47 PM - +263 71 577 9523: No ma'am I have no query
28/12/23, 3:48 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
28/12/23, 3:48 PM - Kirti Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
28/12/23, 3:48 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
28/12/23, 3:48 PM - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
28/12/23, 3:50 PM - +263 71 577 9523: Thank you ma'am
28/12/23, 3:55 PM - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future. <This message was edited>
28/12/23, 4:01 PM - +263 71 577 9523: Thank you ma'am
28/12/23, 4:01 PM - Kirti Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
28/12/23, 4:01 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
28/12/23, 4:01 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

6. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
28/12/23, 4:02 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.*
28/12/23, 4:05 PM - +263 71 577 9523: I'm done ma'am
28/12/23, 4:06 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
28/12/23, 4:06 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of the students A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive your letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you would be able to apply for the student visa.
28/12/23, 4:06 PM - Kirti Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same.

This means Vimbainashe, as an Edoofa student, have the prestigious privilege of securing your seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioning yourself as a frontier person in this endeavor.
28/12/23, 4:09 PM - +263 71 577 9523: Oky ma'am I understand
28/12/23, 4:39 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
28/12/23, 4:39 PM - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
28/12/23, 4:39 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
28/12/23, 4:53 PM - +263 71 577 9523: Oky ma'am I understand
28/12/23, 4:53 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $100 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $1000, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $900.
28/12/23, 4:53 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $1000 fee, you will only be required to pay $900. Once this payment is completed, the entire $1000 amount will be adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $100 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $1000. Does this explanation resonate with you?
28/12/23, 4:55 PM - +263 71 577 9523: Yes ma'am
28/12/23, 4:55 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
28/12/23, 4:55 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $100 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
28/12/23, 4:56 PM - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for January 10, 2024, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $900, you'll need to make a payment of $450 on or before January 10, 2024. The remaining $450 should be paid by February 10 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
28/12/23, 4:58 PM - +263 71 577 9523: No ma'am I'm following
28/12/23, 5:00 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
28/12/23, 5:08 PM - +263 71 577 9523: No ma'am you can provide more information
28/12/23, 5:09 PM - Kirti Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
28/12/23, 5:09 PM - Kirti Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
28/12/23, 5:09 PM - Kirti Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
28/12/23, 5:10 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
28/12/23, 5:16 PM - +263 71 577 9523: Yes ma'am it's all clear now
28/12/23, 5:17 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
28/12/23, 5:18 PM - +263 71 577 9523: Yes ma'am
28/12/23, 5:20 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
28/12/23, 5:20 PM - +263 71 577 9523: Yes I agree
28/12/23, 5:21 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

*1. Reappear in A Level*

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
28/12/23, 5:21 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
28/12/23, 5:40 PM - +263 71 577 9523: Yes ma'am very clear
28/12/23, 6:32 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree*

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her/his interest in August 2024 itself.
28/12/23, 6:32 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
28/12/23, 6:33 PM - +263 71 577 9523: Yes ma'am it's clear
28/12/23, 6:34 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career*

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
28/12/23, 6:35 PM - +263 71 577 9523: Oky i understand ma'am
28/12/23, 6:37 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
28/12/23, 6:40 PM - +263 71 577 9523: No ma'am
28/12/23, 6:40 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As your guardian, I am sure your parents are excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
28/12/23, 6:42 PM - +263 71 577 9523: Yes ma'am I'm very excited
28/12/23, 6:43 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to *evaluate your application* after which if they accept your application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
28/12/23, 6:44 PM - +263 71 577 9523: Oky thank you ma'am
10/1/24, 11:50 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon, Parents and Vimbainashe,

Is it the only university that accepted me
10/1/24, 3:45 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @263715779523 all your concerns would be answered once we start with the letter discussion in detail so please do not worry about that.
10/1/24, 6:04 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings,

Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion for you and your family, and I can only imagine the excitement that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.
10/1/24, 6:04 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you have the letter in your possession, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you've had the chance to go through the offer letter thoroughly? 

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
10/1/24, 6:07 PM - +263 71 577 9523: Yea I've gone through it
10/1/24, 6:11 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As we proceed with today's discussion, we will get into the details of this specific offer letter. I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.
10/1/24, 6:11 PM - Kirti Edoofa: The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
10/1/24, 6:12 PM - +263 71 577 9523: Yes ma'am
10/1/24, 6:12 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from MVN University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
10/1/24, 6:12 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion -

1. What is your per annum tuition fee after the scholarship?
2. What is your per annum accommodation fee after the sponsorship?
3. What is you r annual fee at MVN University after the scholarship?
4. What are your  Sports and Misc. Fee (One-Time payable)
5. What is the Admission and Processing Fee to be paid to secure your scholarship seat?
10/1/24, 6:50 PM - +263 71 577 9523: 1:$0
2:$0
3:$1250
4:$125
5:$1000
10/1/24, 6:53 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for providing the details. As per the offer letter, MVN University has awarded a 100% scholarship on tuition fees, which means you don't have to pay any tuition fees throughout the course duration. This is a significant achievement and will greatly reduce the financial burden on your family.

Also, coming to the accommodation fees, as you can see in the letter, he has also been awarded a 100% waiver on the accommodation expenses, this means that the accommodation provided will be free of cost throughout the stay at MVN University. This is a fantastic opportunity as it further contributes to making education more affordable, isn’t it?
10/1/24, 6:55 PM - +263 71 577 9523: Yes it is affordable
10/1/24, 6:55 PM - +263 71 577 9523: What is the full name
10/1/24, 6:55 PM - +263 71 577 9523: If the university
10/1/24, 7:11 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @263715779523 Please do not worry after we complete our discussion today we will even share the university insights with you.
10/1/24, 7:12 PM - +263 71 577 9523: Oky ma'am
10/1/24, 7:14 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please. As you can see in the offer letter from MVN University, after the scholarship on the tuition and sponsorship fee on accommodation fee, the remaining per annum cost of education that you would have to pay is:

1. Tuition Fee: $0
2. Accommodation Fee: $0
3. University Infrastructure Fee: $575
4. International Student Development Fund: $300
5. Examination Fee (Per Year): $125
6. EDP & Book Bank Fee: $250
10/1/24, 7:14 PM - Kirti Edoofa: With this, if you sum up all the components, you will be able to see that your per annum cost of education is $1250.

At the same time, as you see in the offer letter, there are two components for the first year that are one-time payments, which are the Sports Fee and the Misc. Fee. This means the total expenses for the first year amount to $1250 (tuition) + $250 (fees) = $1500.

It is important to note that this cost is applicable for the first year only. From the second year onwards, your annual cost of education will be $1250. I hope this clarifies things in a better way for you?
10/1/24, 7:30 PM - +263 71 577 9523: Yes ma'am it is clear
10/1/24, 7:37 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Glad to hear that. If you have any questions on your mind or need further clarification, please feel free to bring them up. Also, now that you're aware of your per annum fee, let me share the list of facilities offered by the universities that are covered as per the university's fee structure:

1. Tuition Fee
2. Living Cost
3. Library Fee
4. Examination Fee
5. EDB and Book Bank
6. International Student Development Fund
7. 24-Hour WiFi Cost
8. Maintenance Fee, Water Bill, and Electricity Bill.
10/1/24, 7:37 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Please let me know once you have gone through my above message and when you are ready to continue with our discussion. I look forward to discussing how one can utilize the "Earn While You Learn" Program to make his/her education even more affordable and helping you understand the steps involved in securing this scholarship offer.
10/1/24, 8:06 PM - +263 71 577 9523: Yes I'm done ma'am
10/1/24, 8:08 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing to hear that. Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $1500, let me also guide you on how we can make your education more affordable.

Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
10/1/24, 8:08 PM - Kirti Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn. 

The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. Is this clear to you?
10/1/24, 8:09 PM - +263 71 577 9523: Yes ma'am it is clear
10/1/24, 8:10 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that with hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.
10/1/24, 8:10 PM - Kirti Edoofa: With these earned credits, one can use this $1000 to cover a portion of his/her annual fee, which is $1250. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $1250 - $1000 = $250, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.
10/1/24, 8:10 PM - Kirti Edoofa: This illustrates how one can effectively make their education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
10/1/24, 8:11 PM - +263 71 577 9523: Yes ma'am
10/1/24, 8:12 PM - Kirti Edoofa: It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.
10/1/24, 8:13 PM - Kirti Edoofa: With that said, let us now shift our focus to the registration fee of $1000 mentioned in your offer letter from MVN University. 

The registration fee we are discussing here is somewhat unique, especially for Edoofians. Unlike traditional international students, Edoofa students do not need to consider it as an additional cost to their annual education fees. 

Instead, it is considered a part of the first-year education cost. For you, the cost for your first year of education is $1500 and thus the registration fee of $1000 will be adjusted towards the same. Giving you a total of $500 for your university fees. I hope I am clear to you?
10/1/24, 8:15 PM - +263 71 577 9523: Yes ma'am
10/1/24, 8:16 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Glad to see we share the same perspective. Now talking about the registration fee, as mentioned previously, the admission and processing fee of $1,000 specified in your offer letter will be adjusted against the first-year expenses of $1,500. Consequently, the amount you'll need to pay after you arrive in India will be $1,500 - $1,000 = $500 and is to be paid within three days of your arrival to India. 

I hope you are clear about this as well?
10/1/24, 8:18 PM - +263 71 577 9523: Oky ma'am
10/1/24, 8:19 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Moving forward with our discussion, as you can see in the offer letter, it's outlined that a student is required to submit a registration fee of $1000 within 15 days to secure their scholarship seat with the university. This sets the *deadline date as January 24, 2024*.
10/1/24, 8:19 PM - Kirti Edoofa: However, in reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $100 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
10/1/24, 8:21 PM - +263 71 577 9523: Yes ma'am explain
10/1/24, 8:21 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Given the $100 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent you will be responsible for the remaining $900 of the registration fee. This $900 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of $450 before the first deadline date of *January 24, 2024* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of $450 before the second deadline date of *February 24, 2024* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
10/1/24, 8:22 PM - Kirti Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to *make the full payment of $900 within 15 working days, before January 24, 2024*. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
10/1/24, 8:23 PM - +263 71 577 9523: Yes ma'am thank you
10/1/24, 8:25 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
10/1/24, 8:26 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
10/1/24, 8:27 PM - +263 71 577 9523: Yes ma'am I stay in Harare
10/1/24, 8:28 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
10/1/24, 8:28 PM - Kirti Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
10/1/24, 8:29 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
10/1/24, 8:45 PM - +263 71 577 9523: Oky ma'am thank you
10/1/24, 8:46 PM - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
10/1/24, 8:46 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Charles FBC Bank for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
10/1/24, 8:48 PM - +263 71 577 9523: So if I make the payment in cash do I have to pay the 7% again
10/1/24, 8:48 PM - +263 71 577 9523: No ma'am I got them
10/1/24, 8:51 PM - +263 71 577 9523: Can I ask ma'am....

Does the school changes it's fees structure again and again
10/1/24, 8:52 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Yes please, since he will be helping to make even your cash payments to the Indian account with his account basically he will be paying the transfer charges that you pay to him while depositing the money to him.
10/1/24, 8:54 PM - Kirti Edoofa: No please, since your application is shared under the Endowment program this is another benefit of the program if you reserve your seat now your seat will be reserved as per the current fee structure.
10/1/24, 8:56 PM - +263 71 577 9523: Oky ma'am
10/1/24, 8:56 PM - +263 71 577 9523: Until I'm done ?
10/1/24, 8:57 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Yes please you are correct.
10/1/24, 8:57 PM - +263 71 577 9523: Oky ma'am
10/1/24, 8:57 PM - +263 71 577 9523: Thank you
10/1/24, 8:59 PM - Kirti Edoofa: If making the payment through Mr. Charle’s is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

Account Holder - Charles Jerera
Account Number - 5333 0380 1404 8828
Bank Name - FBC Bank Limited 
Branch - Masvingo
10/1/24, 9:01 PM - +263 71 577 9523: What are the transfer charges
10/1/24, 9:01 PM - Kirti Edoofa: The transfer charges are 12.5%
10/1/24, 9:02 PM - +263 71 577 9523: Oky ma'am
10/1/24, 9:02 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now, that you have all the details with you and understand the letter better, I would like to enquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
10/1/24, 9:03 PM - +263 71 577 9523: For now I think everything is clear
10/1/24, 9:03 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, in that case, let me share a few insights into MVN University with you -
10/1/24, 9:03 PM - Kirti Edoofa: MVN University is one of the prestigious universities located in Delhi NCR, India. Established in 2012 under the Haryana Private Universities Act, it has quickly become a renowned educational hub in the region.

26/1/24, 4:43 PM - +263 71 577 9523: Oky ma'am thank you so much
26/1/24, 4:43 PM - +263 71 577 9523: I will be available
26/1/24, 6:56 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
26/1/24, 6:57 PM - +263 71 577 9523: Yes ma'am I'm available

26/1/24, 7:02 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from Gulzar Group of Institutions, rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
26/1/24, 7:02 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-	

1) What’s your per annum tuition fee after the scholarship as mentioned in the letter? 
2) What's your accommodation/hostel fee per year, as mentioned in the letter?
3) You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
26/1/24, 7:05 PM - +263 71 577 9523: 1:$1000
2:$1200
3: $750
26/1/24, 7:06 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Certainly, you are absolutely correct. I would like to provide some additional details regarding your offer letter from the Gulzar Group of Institutes. As you can see, following the scholarship, your annual tuition fee amounts to $1000.

In the first year, it is compulsory for students to select on-campus hostel accommodation, primarily because the university needs to complete their Foreigners Regional Registration Office (FRRO) formalities. However, from the second year onwards, students have the flexibility to choose off-campus housing if they prefer, as they would have become more familiar with the area and likely formed connections with their classmates.
26/1/24, 7:08 PM - +263 71 577 9523: Oky ma'am thank you
26/1/24, 7:11 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Gulzar Group of Institutes places a strong emphasis on student safety as a top priority. To ensure that students have an affordable and comfortable living experience in the hostels, the university has designed its accommodations with the well-being of the students in mind costing $1200. 

The hostel rooms are four-seaters and come equipped with air conditioning. Importantly, the cost of accommodation also covers the expenses for the food/mess service, which includes three meals a day (breakfast, lunch, and dinner) for each student.
26/1/24, 7:11 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Furthermore, the university intentionally assigns roommates to students to foster a supportive and communal atmosphere, enabling students to rely on their peers for assistance and companionship. 

This approach enhances the overall living experience and contributes to a sense of security and camaraderie within the student community. I hope you have taken note of this and this clarifies the tuition fee and the accommodation facilities for you?
26/1/24, 7:13 PM - +263 71 577 9523: Oky ma'am
26/1/24, 7:14 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In light of this, let us move forward with our discussion. As you are now familiar with your annual fee at Gulzar Group of Institutes, let me outline the various facilities and services covered by the university's fee structure:

1. Tuition Fee
2. Living/Accommodation Costs
3. Food Costs
4. Library Fee
5. 24-Hour Wifi Access
6. Maintenance Fee
7. Water Bill
8. Electricity Bill

These components collectively make up the comprehensive package that you will receive as part of his university fee, ensuring a well-rounded and hassle-free educational experience. I hope we are together so far and this resonates with you?
26/1/24, 7:16 PM - +263 71 577 9523: Yes ma'am we are together
26/1/24, 7:17 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now that we have established the tuition fee at $1000 and accommodation fee at $1200, making your total annual education cost $2200, let me guide you on how we can make his education more affordable.

Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. Through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
26/1/24, 7:17 PM - Kirti Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn. 

The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. Is this clear to you?
26/1/24, 7:21 PM - +263 71 577 9523: Yes ma'am it is clear
26/1/24, 7:23 PM - Kirti Edoofa: With this said, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that you with your hard work earn scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.
26/1/24, 7:23 PM - Kirti Edoofa: With these earned credits, he can use this $1000 to cover a portion of his annual fee, which is $2200. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $2200 - $1000 = $1200, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.
26/1/24, 7:24 PM - Kirti Edoofa: This illustrates how you can effectively make his education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
26/1/24, 7:25 PM - +263 71 577 9523: Yes ma'am they are
26/1/24, 7:59 PM - Kirti Edoofa: It's reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.

Having said that, let us now shift our focus to the registration fee mentioned in your offer letter.
26/1/24, 8:00 PM - Kirti Edoofa: As previously mentioned, the registration fee of $750 is not an additional cost; instead, it's a part of your first-year tuition fee. Therefore, it will be adjusted against the total fee of $2200 for the first year. 

Consequently, the remaining fee that you will be required to pay after arrives in India will be $2200 - $750 = $1450. This amount can be conveniently paid in two installments of $725 with a six-month gap between them. <This message was edited>
26/1/24, 8:00 PM - Kirti Edoofa: The first installment can be paid either before arrival in India or within three days of his arrival in August 2024. The second installment will be due in the subsequent semester, in January 2025.

I hope this information is clear and we both have a shared understanding of this arrangement?
26/1/24, 8:14 PM - +263 71 577 9523: Oky ma'am thank you
26/1/24, 8:15 PM - +263 71 577 9523: Yes ma'am it is clear
26/1/24, 8:16 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on 9th February 2024*. I hope we are together so far?
26/1/24, 8:21 PM - +263 71 577 9523: Yes ma'am we are together
26/1/24, 8:22 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $100 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
26/1/24, 8:23 PM - +263 71 577 9523: Yes ma'am you can explain again
26/1/24, 8:24 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $100 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $650 of the registration fee. This $600 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$325 before the first deadline date of February 9th, 2024* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$325 before the second deadline date of March 9th, 2024* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
26/1/24, 8:24 PM - Kirti Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $650 within 15 working days, before feb 9th, 2024. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
26/1/24, 8:25 PM - +263 71 577 9523: Oky ma'am thank you
26/1/24, 8:26 PM - +263 71 577 9523: Yes ma'am
26/1/24, 8:27 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @263715779523 I am sure you are aware of the payments modes right?
26/1/24, 8:28 PM - +263 71 577 9523: Yes ma'am ....you said I can pay through Mr Charles Jerere right?
26/1/24, 8:29 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Yes please you are right.
26/1/24, 8:29 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now, that you have all the details with you and understand the letter better, I would like to enquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
26/1/24, 8:30 PM - +263 71 577 9523: Oky ma'am....can you tell me  the transfer charges again
26/1/24, 8:30 PM - +263 71 577 9523: No ma'am
26/1/24, 8:31 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @263715779523 the transfer charges for Mr. Charles is 12.5%
26/1/24, 8:31 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, let me share a few insights into the university with you -
