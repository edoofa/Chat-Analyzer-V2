I trust you're all in good health. I wanted to reach out today, as the second deadline is drawing near. Hence I wanted to check on your preparations for this and to inquire about your plans, especially considering the upcoming festival season.

I trust this message finds you well and in high spirits. As I was organizing my day today, I took the opportunity to review your scholarship application file. I observed that the remaining amount of $425 for your university registration fee is due before January 1, 2024.

How is your preparation going forward? Have you been able to raise the outstanding amount of $425 by now? <This message was edited>

In recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024.
