29/12/23, 7:44 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @27623108365 It is good to know that. May I know if your statement of entry for A- level or the exam date sheet for grade 12?
29/12/23, 7:46 PM - +27 62 310 8365: I'm sorry sir , I lost it when I was still at school
29/12/23, 7:54 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In that case, @27623108365 I would suggest you please connect with your school teacher and tell them the reason why you need a letter of recommendation. 

Here are some key points to consider when requesting the letter from your school:

1. *Visit Your School*: Approach your school administration or the designated authority for issuing such letters.

2. *Provide Necessary Information*: Ensure that the drafted letter includes essential details such as your identity as a student of the school, your subject combination for A Level exams, and your intention to sit for the exams this academic year.

3. *Printing and Signing*: Request the school to print the letter on official letterhead and have it signed/stamped by the appropriate authority.

4. *Include Authority Details*: Ensure that the letter contains the details of the signing authority, including their full name, contact number, and email ID.
29/12/23, 7:54 PM - Kirti Edoofa: This letter of recommendation is a crucial document that will support your application process. The Edoofa Academic Board will use those details to reach out to your school authorities and verify the recommendation letter before adding it to your scholarship application and hence I would like to enquire by when will you be able to share the same document with us?
29/12/23, 7:56 PM - +27 62 310 8365: Okay
29/12/23, 7:59 PM - +27 62 310 8365: Right now schools are closed , they will open on 9th of January 2024
29/12/23, 8:06 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In that case, you can share the letter with me on the 9th of January 2024.
29/12/23, 8:07 PM - +27 62 310 8365: I will try my best
29/12/23, 8:11 PM - +27 62 310 8365: Results for 2022 candidates were released on 13th of January 2023 ,so I'm   thinking they will be out real soon
29/12/23, 8:11 PM - +263 77 586 0274: Sir let me answer honestly on that. It is not easy to get it exactly on the opening day. Some teachers will not be there at school on the opening day. Usually first week of January school authorities are very busy with the form ones.
Since he is not here in Zimbabwe I will go there myself to meet the acting head
29/12/23, 8:17 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @27623108365 Thank you for letting me know that, in that case. Let us reconnect on the 2nd of January 2024, that is Tuesday. As we will not be available tomorrow due to the weekend, followed by the New year. I hope you will be available.

I trust this message finds you in good health. As we step into the second week of January, I wanted to reach out and share an exciting milestone that India as a country achieved within the first week of 2024 - the successful India's Chandrayaan-3 Engine Test.
12/1/24, 5:43 PM - Kirti Edoofa: This accomplishment is responsible for the third lunar mission, aiming to land a rover on the Moon's south polar region and conduct scientific studies that could check Moon's viability to sustain life. It signifies a significant scientific advancement, laying the groundwork for future progress.
12/1/24, 5:43 PM - Kirti Edoofa: This achievement has not only pushed boundaries but also inspired young minds all over the world to pursue their dreams. On the same note, I wanted to extend my heartiest wishes for the New Year to you and your family and check in to see how you and your family started your year?
12/1/24, 6:23 PM - +263 77 586 0274: We are fine sir. Thank you very  much for the wishes of the New year.
I am happy to let you know that the A level results are out snd the boy did very well.
12/1/24, 7:02 PM - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. I am glad to hear that. With great excitement and pride, I also want to share that over the past few days, the Edoofa team has been immersed in an exciting event we had in store for our students. Edoofa hosted a conference - the Symposium of Leaders, Innovators, and Creators at Edoofa, also known as 'SLICE-CON.'

The conference was attended by all the Edoofians of 2023 and a few senior Edoofians from previous batches. It focused on the art of creation, innovation, and, most importantly, the mindset required to make an impact in one's career.
12/1/24, 7:02 PM - Kirti Edoofa: During this Industrial Visit and the conference - SLICE CON, Corporate leaders, such as the CEOs and Co-founders from renowned companies like Rage Coffee, Sirona Hygiene, Jolin New York, and more, shared their insights and experiences. These individuals are at the helm of multi-millionaire brands, leading large marketing teams. Their presence added immense value, providing students with the opportunity to engage in transformative conversations.
12/1/24, 7:02 PM - Kirti Edoofa: We believe that interactions with such industry leaders can bring significant transformations to students' lives, enhancing their business acumen. Our Edoofians maximized this opportunity, having life-changing conversations with these influential figures. The main objective of the event was to emphasize the importance of thinking outside the box, and encouraging students to believe in themselves and their dreams. Before we discuss your admission journey further, I wanted to share a glimpse of the event, and I hope you are excited to attend similar events when you come to India.

I hope this message finds you all well and in high spirits. I apologize for not being in touch over the past few days. Unfortunately, I was dealing with a significant ENT infection and needed to follow my doctor's recommendation for rest, which meant taking some time off to prioritize my health. As a result, I was unable to inform you about my temporary absence. Thankfully, I'm feeling considerably better now and am ready to resume our interactions. Before we proceed with our discussion, I'd like to catch up - how have you and your family been lately?
24/1/24, 5:27 PM - +263 77 586 0274: We are fine sir thank. How are you also?

25/1/24, 1:11 PM - +27 62 310 8365: If a student is selected  after the interview,  he/she receive an acceptance letter , on paying the program fee in accordance of the round of application,  he /she is guided through the application process for the university  they can apply to
25/1/24, 1:15 PM - +27 62 310 8365: Edoofa also helps in  working on the document of purpose and other documents 
And after a student receive a letter of intent from the campus,  he is required to pay a registration fee of 500usd
25/1/24, 1:54 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. I can clearly see that you have understood the process really well. Moving forward I would like to inquire if you have any queries or concerns that you would like to share regarding the registration process?
25/1/24, 1:57 PM - +27 62 310 8365: Yah , i would like to know the universities which u would  apply for me
25/1/24, 2:02 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @27623108365 Since we are connected with more than 250+ universities providing you with a list of universities will not be possible for me so stay assured once we complete our discussion today your application will be shared with multiple universities and as soon as we get updates we will be notifying you.
25/1/24, 2:03 PM - +27 62 310 8365: Okay
25/1/24, 2:03 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now with this, we are done with step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
25/1/24, 2:03 PM - Kirti Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one.
25/1/24, 2:03 PM - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
25/1/24, 2:12 PM - +27 62 310 8365: Sounds amazing
25/1/24, 2:25 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, indeed @27623108365 . The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
25/1/24, 2:25 PM - Kirti Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received special news for the students of the 2024 admission intake. May I know if you are excited to know the news we have for you?
25/1/24, 2:32 PM - +27 62 310 8365: Yes , I am
25/1/24, 2:34 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am happy to see that you are excited. After speaking with thousands of students and parents who completed their admission process before you, we realized that the current economic situation in African countries makes it a bit challenging for parents to pay the full registration fee at once.
25/1/24, 2:34 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In response to the same challenge, we had a detailed discussion with the academic board and university official. As a result, we developed a solution to alleviate the financial burden of the parents specifically for the registration fee due of $500 to $1000. 

We at Edoofa are thrilled about this development, and I believe it will significantly help all of our students and their families. Are you aware of the solution?
25/1/24, 2:39 PM - +27 62 310 8365: Yah it's amazing 👏
25/1/24, 2:40 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright, let me share the same. With respect to the conversation we had with the academic board and the university officials, we requested them to allow the students to make the payment of their registration fee in two parts within a span of 45 days thereby reducing the financial pressure.
25/1/24, 2:40 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: Consider that your registration fee is $750. After you will receive the offer letter, the first part of the registration fees which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, i.e. $375 needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university (For most of the universities 15 days). Subsequently, the second part of $375, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
25/1/24, 2:40 PM - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for January 25, 2024, and your registration fee stands at $750, you'll need to make a payment of $375 on or before January 25, 2024. The remaining $375 should be paid by February 25 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
25/1/24, 2:44 PM - +27 62 310 8365: No, I feeling u
25/1/24, 3:11 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
25/1/24, 3:21 PM - +27 62 310 8365: I think I'm gud , I don know my mom
25/1/24, 3:24 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That is good to know. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to *evaluate your application* after which if they accept your application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
25/1/24, 3:26 PM - +27 62 310 8365: Thanks u , be blessed 🙌
31/1/24, 9:37 PM - +263 77 586 0274: Greetings

Your presence would truly make the event all the more meaningful, guiding you on your journey to India. Hence, with immense joy, we wanted to extend the special invitation for the Meet and Greet Seminar to you and your wonderful family.
6/2/24, 9:10 PM - Kirti Edoofa: And in the process of doing the same, I happened to notice that you haven't started your EWYL Program by now. In light of this, I had a discussion with Ms. Sanjana, the head of the EWYL Department, and I am happy to share that she has graciously agreed to make a special exception for you, expediting your application process.
6/2/24, 9:10 PM - Kirti Edoofa: As a result, I have gone ahead and created your very own dedicated EWYL Group - *Samuel EWYL22E0640*, adding both you and your parents to the mix. If I have missed including any other family members, they can easily join using the following link: [https://chat.whatsapp.com/LMYzKcduMKaKSbCB79BwqK].

Within the group, the EWYL team will not only guide you on the hows and whens of the EWYL Program but also share all the exciting details about the upcoming Meet and Greet Seminar in Harare. We are genuinely thrilled to witness you embark on this transformative journey, and we are rooting for your success every step of the way!

Warmest regards,
Admissions Team.
