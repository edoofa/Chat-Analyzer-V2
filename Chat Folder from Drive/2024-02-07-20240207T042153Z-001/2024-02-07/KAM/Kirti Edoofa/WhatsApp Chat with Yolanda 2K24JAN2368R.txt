I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them. 

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
3/2/24, 11:45 AM - +263 78 069 4460: Yes maam let's start
3/2/24, 11:56 AM - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
3/2/24, 11:58 AM - +263 78 069 4460: Thank you maam I am done
3/2/24, 12:00 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
3/2/24, 12:00 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
3/2/24, 12:06 PM - +263 78 069 4460: Yes maam they are clear thank you
3/2/24, 12:08 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
3/2/24, 12:08 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
3/2/24, 12:10 PM - +263 78 069 4460: Yes ma'am we are together thank you
3/2/24, 12:10 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process, the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
3/2/24, 12:10 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
3/2/24, 12:13 PM - +263 78 069 4460: Everything is clear thank you so much
3/2/24, 12:16 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
3/2/24, 12:17 PM - +263 78 069 4460: Yes maam let's start
3/2/24, 12:18 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
3/2/24, 12:18 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding until you are ready, shall we start with our discussion with me individually?
3/2/24, 12:26 PM - +263 78 069 4460: Yes maam
3/2/24, 12:26 PM - Kirti Edoofa: For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
3/2/24, 12:34 PM - +263 78 069 4460: Yes maam I am ready
3/2/24, 12:35 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Let me share the videos with you now

5/2/24, 6:14 PM - +263 78 069 4460: I am ready for the session
5/2/24, 6:15 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for asking, I am doing great. May I know if you were able to go through the videos by now?
5/2/24, 6:16 PM - +263 78 069 4460: Yes  maam I went through the videos.
5/2/24, 6:22 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That is good to know, so could you please share your understanding of the 4 videos?
5/2/24, 6:48 PM - +263 78 069 4460: On the first vedio I learnt students must be open minded and they must follow instructions ginen by their mentos.

In vedio 2:I learnt that Edoofa's vision is to increase student's capacity for success so as to make them more responsible and  independent  and that can be possible if students comply  by following instructions .

In vedio 3 :l learnt that colleges and universities under the Edoofa program provide best quality education , they have good infrastructure and accommodation, I also got to know that these schools provide good English instructions which is best for international students. They focus on schools which are much concerned on best education rather than making a schol a business institution.



In vedio 4 :I learnt that In preparation of the statement of purpose one needs to bring out ideas which convince the academic board as well as the school. I learnt that one needs to showcase their uniqueness , academic vision  as well as their strength
5/2/24, 6:50 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. Let me share my views as well so that it will help you expand your understanding.

*Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students:* In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. 

You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent.
5/2/24, 6:50 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s vision for you:* Here our founders talk about the most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
5/2/24, 6:50 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program:* Talking about the third video, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
5/2/24, 6:50 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP:* Another thing is that Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based. 

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.

So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by tomorrow 01:30 PM.
