I hope you are doing well. I understand your perspective, and I want to clarify a point regarding our recent communications. Upon reviewing the messages, there was indeed a clerical error on our end. This discrepancy was an oversight from our side, and it seems it wasn't noticed by you as well. The reason we share the breakdown with you as parents is to avoid these errors. I want to assure you that there's no intention to assign blame here; our focus is on finding a constructive way forward.
29/12/23, 8:23 PM - Kirti Edoofa: We have supported you in the past and continue to stand by you. What we need now is to figure out how best to proceed. Could you please share your plans for making the remaining deposit of $16?

I trust this message finds you well, and I hope you are in high spirits. In recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their A-Level results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey.
16/1/24, 1:39 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?
