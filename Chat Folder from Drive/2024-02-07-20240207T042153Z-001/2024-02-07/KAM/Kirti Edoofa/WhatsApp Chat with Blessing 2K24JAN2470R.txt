I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them. 

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
3/2/24, 12:01 PM - +263 71 435 1714: I am ready,let's start.
3/2/24, 12:02 PM - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
3/2/24, 12:03 PM - +263 71 435 1714: I am done reading.
3/2/24, 12:04 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
3/2/24, 12:04 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
3/2/24, 12:06 PM - +263 71 435 1714: Yes there are.
3/2/24, 12:08 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
3/2/24, 12:08 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
3/2/24, 12:09 PM - +263 71 435 1714: Yes,l am following closely.
3/2/24, 12:10 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process, the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
3/2/24, 12:10 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
3/2/24, 12:11 PM - +263 71 435 1714: All is clear and l have understood.
3/2/24, 12:16 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
3/2/24, 12:17 PM - +263 71 435 1714: Yes let's start.
3/2/24, 12:18 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
3/2/24, 12:18 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding until you are ready, shall we start with our discussion with me individually?
3/2/24, 12:19 PM - +263 71 435 1714: Let's proceed.
3/2/24, 12:22 PM - Kirti Edoofa: For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
3/2/24, 12:24 PM - +263 71 435 1714: Yes,let's move forward.
3/2/24, 12:24 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Let me share the videos with you now <This message was edited>

3/2/24, 1:35 PM - +263 71 435 1714: Thank you.same applies
3/2/24, 4:07 PM - +263 77 292 4625: Thanks so much it has been a pleasure  hearing progress in this session.
5/2/24, 12:21 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP:* Another thing is that Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based. 

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
5/2/24, 12:23 PM - +263 71 435 1714: Thank you it's very clear and understandable
5/2/24, 12:27 PM - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of NAME’S university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in NAME’S admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
5/2/24, 12:28 PM - +263 71 435 1714: Yes we are.
5/2/24, 12:30 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by tomorrow 01:30 PM.
5/2/24, 12:30 PM - Kirti Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

5/2/24, 12:30 PM - Kirti Edoofa: 2. I am sharing two documents with you. Kindly go through both documents and submit your responses to the course document here in the group. Make sure you research well before starting the task. All the best!
5/2/24, 12:30 PM - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
5/2/24, 12:31 PM - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
5/2/24, 12:31 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Along with these documents, I want you to share the following documents with us as they are required for your university application preparation:

*1. A-Level Result*

*2. O-Level Results*
5/2/24, 1:33 PM - +263 71 435 1714: <Media omitted>
5/2/24, 1:46 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the question 1 it is duly noted with us.
5/2/24, 1:57 PM - +263 71 435 1714: 2.Looking at my country's development l can see that it is developing at a slower rate due to lack of enough engineers to work on improving it at a faster rate. To make it develop exponentially through my career path l would like to revive and help most if not electrical companies that were in Zimbabwe.These companies include the AE electrical company, Mutare board and Paper company, Zimbabwe Steel Company and the Kariba hydro power station.l would also like to build more power plants so that the country does not experience shortage of electricity as it facing now hence in building more power plants it means that industries are not going to to be disturbed by power cuts thus they will reach their targets and demands and will export some of the goods to strengthen back the relationships with other countries.In addition to that, since Electricity will be more than enough to the country some is going to be exported to other countries help run their industries as well.This will also reduces the costs of importing goods since we will be making most of the goods on our own.Furthermore the county will be open for employment and living standards to most citizens will be better due to employment on the companies and the country will be developing at a faster rate since crime rates will be reduced due to employment.
5/2/24, 1:59 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I shall wait for your response to the remaining questions.
5/2/24, 2:01 PM - +263 71 435 1714: Well.My network is poor so its taking long to send .
5/2/24, 2:03 PM - Kirti Edoofa: It is alright please, I understand that network can be a challenge, in that case, you can share the remaining answers by tomorrow 01:30 pm.
5/2/24, 2:27 PM - +263 71 435 1714: For a start l would like to work at Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited (BHEL) as l will be preparing to open my individual company.l would like to work for that company because it is the world's largest leading company of Electricals.Because it the leading company it means that it has famous and recognized engineers and it will be easy for me to get along with them and be recognized even after l leave to open my open company.Moreso  l will be having a lot of exposure and open mind to carry and invent many things with the help of other experts hence making the electrical products more upgraded and making other countries will develop and people satisfied with the electrical equipments.The major reason of working for the company is to get to know how to aim higher since l would also like to be leading in the production of electrical equipments in the world and do gain legacy in the pages of the history of the world by also providing help to others
5/2/24, 2:32 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing question 3, it is well noted with us.
5/2/24, 3:52 PM - +263 71 435 1714: <Media omitted>
5/2/24, 3:56 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for submitting the SOP form, it is duly noted with us.
5/2/24, 4:44 PM - +263 71 435 1714: 4. The difference between electronic and electrical systems is electronic systems deals with the flow of electrons in equipments whereas electrical systems deals with transportation and distribution of power.Electronic systems are designed to process electrical signals.They include computers, switches, hubs and just a few to mention.Electronic systems also control the flow of electrons in order to perform a task. Electrical systems consists of elements needed to distribute electrical power, including overhead,transformers and poles.Electrical systems have three main components which are generation unit, transmission unit and distribution unit.They are designed as combination of 3 fundamental components that is the resistor, capacitor and inductor. <This message was edited>
5/2/24, 4:44 PM - +263 71 435 1714: 5. A capacitor is a device used to store electric charge temporarily.It stores electric charge through distributing the charge across a parallel plate to create potential difference.when connected to a power supply, electrons flow from the negative terminal and to the end of the terminal and build up at one end of the capacitor.The capacitor then charges and stores the energy when full.when they is a power cut let's say for instance a device will not shut down immediately but it gives one a short time to save his or her work.The reason why it does not shut down immediately is because the capacitor will be discharging the energy.capacitors are also used to prevent electrical surges too despite using them as charge storage devices.

5/2/24, 5:52 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for submitting your SOP, the academic interview questions, and the academic documents. It is well noted with us, and we have shared the same with the admissions team as well. They will now evaluate your response and will be proceeding to work on them so that your university application is well prepared.
5/2/24, 5:53 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Before we move ahead with our discussion, I have some news to share with you. 

https://chat.whatsapp.com/DfZWbabowNRAc4orPX3z2H

"Use the above-provided link to join your group. Once both you and your parents have joined, please send the following message to the group:

Kindly schedule my session for the same date so that I can maximize the benefits and start on the right track.*"
5/2/24, 5:53 PM - Kirti Edoofa: "Once you start with the EWYL Program and are able to connect with your mentor, please update the same here as well by sending the below message -

Hello Admission officer, I am now in touch with my EWYL Mentor. The name of my Mentor is _________ and he/she has scheduled my session for ________"
5/2/24, 6:06 PM - +263 71 435 1714: It's fine l will update you.
5/2/24, 6:08 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Surely, since the available hours for the EWYL team are over now, your mentor will be available to connect with you tomorrow only so you can share the message on the group and update me tomorrow.
5/2/24, 6:09 PM - +263 71 435 1714: Well, thank you
5/2/24, 6:13 PM - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. *Now with this, we have completed the second step of your university admission cycle, and hence we will move forward to the third step in your admission journey.*
5/2/24, 6:13 PM - Kirti Edoofa: To be on the same page, If I am correct, I believe you want to pursue a bachelor's degree in the course B.Tech (Electronics and Electrical Engineering) for your higher education in India as per the August 2024 intake?
5/2/24, 6:16 PM - +263 71 435 1714: Yes you are correct.
5/2/24, 6:17 PM - Kirti Edoofa: With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey. we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*.
5/2/24, 6:17 PM - +263 71 435 1714: Sure,let's proceed.
5/2/24, 6:18 PM - Kirti Edoofa: However, before we do the same, I was going through your scholarship application file and noticed that you are supposed to make the payment of your remaining part of Edoofa Enrollment fee before 29th February 2024. Hence, I thought of sharing a gentle reminder with you and try to understand how your preparation has been so far? Have you been able to align your preparations in the right direction?
5/2/24, 6:20 PM - +263 71 435 1714: We are working on it ,we will pay soon.
5/2/24, 6:20 PM - +263 71 435 1714: Yes we are trying to get them in the right direction
5/2/24, 6:21 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. We will reconnect with each other a few days before your due date to take a follow up on this and understand your preparations better.  Now let us move ahead with our discussion, so may I know if you ready?
5/2/24, 6:22 PM - +263 71 435 1714: Yes l am ready
5/2/24, 6:22 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
5/2/24, 6:22 PM - Kirti Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
5/2/24, 6:22 PM - Kirti Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
5/2/24, 6:22 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
5/2/24, 6:24 PM - +263 71 435 1714: Yes,it's not practical.
5/2/24, 6:25 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
5/2/24, 6:25 PM - Kirti Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $1000. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
5/2/24, 6:25 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
5/2/24, 6:27 PM - +263 71 435 1714: Yes,we  discussed about it clearly.
5/2/24, 6:43 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $1200 to $1800 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
5/2/24, 7:23 PM - +263 71 435 1714: Yes, we are on the same page. <This message was edited>
5/2/24, 7:36 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:
1. *Tuition Fee*: $650 per annum
2. *Accommodation Fee*: $0 per annum (100% Sponsorship)
3. *Remaining Fee Components*: [Library Fee, Examination Fee, EDB and Book Bank, International Student Development Fund, 24-Hour WiFi Cost, Maintenance Fee, Water Bill, and Electricity Bill]: $1000 per annum
*Total Fee: Tuition Fee $650 + Accommodation Fee $0 + Remaining Fee Components $1000 = $1650 per annum.*

Registration Fee to be paid: $1000 (deadline within two weeks of issue of the offer letter, part of the university’s first-year fee and will be adjusted against the first-year cost of education $1650). I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup? <This message was edited>
5/2/24, 7:39 PM - +263 71 435 1714: Yes l did.
5/2/24, 7:40 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $1000, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $1000 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $1650 as per the above example. Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $1650 - $1000 = $650. This amount can be paid within the first three days of your arrival in India.
5/2/24, 7:41 PM - +263 71 435 1714: I understood
5/2/24, 7:42 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
5/2/24, 7:43 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
5/2/24, 7:43 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
5/2/24, 7:45 PM - +263 71 435 1714: It's clear and understandable
5/2/24, 8:00 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
5/2/24, 8:03 PM - +263 71 435 1714: No queries yet ,we can proceed.
5/2/24, 8:08 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, Now with this, we are done with step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
5/2/24, 8:08 PM - Kirti Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one.
5/2/24, 8:08 PM - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
5/2/24, 8:11 PM - +263 71 435 1714: Thank you Officer
5/2/24, 8:12 PM - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received special news for the students of the 2024 admission intake. May I know if you are excited to know the news we have for you?
5/2/24, 8:14 PM - +263 71 435 1714: Yes l am excited and curious to know?
5/2/24, 8:20 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am happy to see that you are excited. After speaking with thousands of students and parents who completed their admission process before you, we realized that the current economic situation in African countries makes it a bit challenging for parents to pay the full registration fee at once. 

In response to the same challenge, we had a detailed discussion with the academic board and university official. As a result, we developed a solution to alleviate the financial burden of the parents specifically for the registration fee due of $500 to $1000.
5/2/24, 8:20 PM - Kirti Edoofa: We at Edoofa are thrilled about this development, and I believe it will significantly help all of our students and their families. Are you aware of the solution?
5/2/24, 8:21 PM - +263 71 435 1714: No l am not aware
5/2/24, 8:22 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright, let me share the same. With respect to the conversation we had with the academic board and the university officials, we requested them to allow the students to make the payment of their registration fee in two parts within a span of 45 days thereby reducing the financial pressure.
5/2/24, 8:22 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: Consider that your registration fee is $1000. After you will receive the offer letter, the first part of the registration fees which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, i.e. $500 needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university (For most of the universities 15 days). Subsequently, the second part of $500, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
5/2/24, 8:22 PM - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for February 15, 2024, and your registration fee stands at $1000, you'll need to make a payment of $500 on or before February 15, 2024. The remaining $500 should be paid by March 15, 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
5/2/24, 8:24 PM - +263 71 435 1714: It's now clear
5/2/24, 8:24 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
5/2/24, 8:25 PM - +263 71 435 1714: I have no queries
5/2/24, 8:27 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. As your guardian, I am sure your parents are excited to initiate the process? For the current round of admissions, only 31 scholarship seats are available and hence let us begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the payment plan offered for the registration fee. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
5/2/24, 8:29 PM - +263 71 435 1714: Yes l am excited
5/2/24, 8:30 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to *evaluate your application* after which if they accept your application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
