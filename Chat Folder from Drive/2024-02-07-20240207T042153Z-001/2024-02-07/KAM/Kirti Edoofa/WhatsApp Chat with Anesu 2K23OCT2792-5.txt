26/12/23, 3:57 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Anesu.

I hope you are doing well and had a delightful Christmas celebration. With regard to our previous conversation, may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
26/12/23, 4:10 PM - +263 77 795 2977: Yes we are around sorry for the delay

26/12/23, 9:36 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I was expecting to hear back from you, but as there hasn't been a response and given that it's been a long day for me, along with the conclusion of our working hours, let's plan to reconnect tomorrow to continue our discussion. I'm optimistic that you'll be able to connect then. Have a great night, and looking forward to our conversation tomorrow.

27/12/23, 1:29 PM - +263 77 795 2977: Yes please
27/12/23, 1:30 PM - Kirti Edoofa: May I know if you are clear so far?
27/12/23, 1:44 PM - +263 77 795 2977: Our network is down
27/12/23, 2:03 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I completely understand that network can be a challenge, however, we have not been able to have a smooth conversation for many days now, and it is impacting on Anesu's admission process if this time is a challenge for you may I know what time will be suitable for you to connect with us now?
27/12/23, 3:31 PM - +263 77 795 2977: As from 8 or 9am up to 1 pm it will be faster than now
27/12/23, 3:44 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @263777952977 as you are aware our available hours are from 12:30 pm CAT to 08:30 pm CAT. So connecting with you at 08:00 am will not be possible for me.
27/12/23, 3:46 PM - +263 77 795 2977: OK noted
27/12/23, 3:55 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please. May I know if you are available to connect with us now?
27/12/23, 4:39 PM - +263 77 795 2977: I'm available but Anesu is not around
27/12/23, 4:41 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @263777952977 it is alright please, I am sure Anesu will be able to go through the conversation once available, in the meantime we can continue with our discussion.
27/12/23, 4:41 PM - +263 77 795 2977: Sure
27/12/23, 4:42 PM - Kirti Edoofa: So may I know if you are clear so far?
27/12/23, 4:50 PM - +263 77 795 2977: Yes I have understand but clearly with our monthly salaries here paying a once off payment of 9000 USD is a big deal for me because that amount is double my salary but maybe I can manage instalments in 3 months of 300,300,300
27/12/23, 4:50 PM - +263 77 795 2977: But however maybe I might have a salary increament in January next year I'm not sure
27/12/23, 5:02 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @263777952977 as we move ahead with our discussion your concern will be answered as well with additional benefits so please do not worry.
27/12/23, 5:51 PM - +263 77 795 2977: Noted thank you Kirti
27/12/23, 5:53 PM - +263 77 795 2977: 👏👏👏
27/12/23, 5:53 PM - +263 77 795 2977: My network is slow your pardon Kirt
27/12/23, 6:08 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I understand that network can be a challenge. May I know if you are comfortable proceeding with the discussion now?
27/12/23, 6:14 PM - +263 77 795 2977: Yes I am
27/12/23, 6:15 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
27/12/23, 6:16 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
27/12/23, 6:16 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
27/12/23, 6:19 PM - +263 77 795 2977: Noted
27/12/23, 6:21 PM - +263 77 795 2977: May i know  for convenience sake how much is the visa fee and flight fee so that I may prepare for it
27/12/23, 6:26 PM - +263 77 795 2977: Precisely thank you
27/12/23, 6:29 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Surely, let me help you here. The average cost of a flight ticket from Zimbabwe to India will be between $400 to $500 and will have to be paid by the student and the visa fee is $83.
27/12/23, 6:30 PM - +263 77 795 2977: OK noted
27/12/23, 6:30 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
27/12/23, 6:31 PM - +263 77 795 2977: When are you expecting the students around August or when
27/12/23, 6:32 PM - +263 77 795 2977: Yes you might kind of shed more light on that
27/12/23, 6:35 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, the academic year in India starts from August 2024.
27/12/23, 6:35 PM - +263 77 795 2977: OK noted
27/12/23, 6:35 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
27/12/23, 6:36 PM - Kirti Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
27/12/23, 6:36 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
27/12/23, 6:36 PM - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
27/12/23, 6:37 PM - +263 77 795 2977: Following
27/12/23, 6:39 PM - +263 77 795 2977: Ooh I see the students in the picture are looking so excited
27/12/23, 6:41 PM - +263 77 795 2977: Looking forward to that
27/12/23, 6:42 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Indeed it was heartwarming to meet them finally, I hope you are excited to see Anesu in this picture for next year.
27/12/23, 6:43 PM - +263 77 795 2977: Yesss quite excited you can say that again
27/12/23, 6:45 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
27/12/23, 6:52 PM - +263 77 795 2977: Thank you so much for the assurance
27/12/23, 6:53 PM - +263 77 795 2977: Together we will make it
27/12/23, 6:55 PM - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
27/12/23, 6:56 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
27/12/23, 6:56 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

6. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
27/12/23, 6:56 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.*
27/12/23, 7:10 PM - +263 77 795 2977: I'm done with the benefits
27/12/23, 7:13 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
27/12/23, 7:13 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of the students A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive your letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you would be able to apply for the student visa.
27/12/23, 7:13 PM - Kirti Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same.

This means Anesu, as an Edoofa student, have the prestigious privilege of securing your seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioning yourself as a frontier person in this endeavor.
27/12/23, 7:29 PM - +263 77 795 2977: Whaaaw that's great
27/12/23, 7:32 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
27/12/23, 7:32 PM - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
27/12/23, 7:32 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
27/12/23, 7:47 PM - +263 77 795 2977: Certainly
27/12/23, 7:48 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $100 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $1000, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $900.
27/12/23, 7:48 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $1000 fee, you will only be required to pay $900. Once this payment is completed, the entire $1000 amount will be adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $100 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $1000. Does this explanation resonate with you?
27/12/23, 8:11 PM - +263 77 795 2977: Yes please
27/12/23, 8:11 PM - +263 77 795 2977: Network down
27/12/23, 8:24 PM - +263 77 795 2977: Can we meet tomorrow Kirti phone battery about to die
27/12/23, 8:40 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @263777952977 I completely understand that network can be a challenge, surely we can connect tomorrow at 01:00 pm CAT, may I know if you are alright with the time?
28/12/23, 12:06 AM - +263 77 795 2977: Yes I will be available
28/12/23, 1:24 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon parents and Anesu,

I hope this message finds you in good health. In continuation of our earlier conversation, I'm reaching out to check if you are now available to connect with us. Doing so will enable us to proceed with our discussion as we had initially intended.
28/12/23, 1:24 PM - +263 71 870 6208: Yes
28/12/23, 1:26 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing, so may I know if you are clear so far?
28/12/23, 1:27 PM - +263 71 870 6208: Yes
28/12/23, 1:29 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
28/12/23, 1:29 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $100 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
28/12/23, 1:29 PM - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for January 10, 2024, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $900, you'll need to make a payment of $450 on or before January 10, 2024. The remaining $450 should be paid by February 10 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
28/12/23, 1:34 PM - +263 71 870 6208: Not yet
28/12/23, 1:34 PM - +263 71 870 6208: In the situation that u have failed what will you do
28/12/23, 1:38 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you understand, if after getting the offer letter one fails to pay the registration fee as per the deadlines given by the university, the university shall revoke the letter, however, if discuss it with us openly regarding your challenges, we might be able to assist you with extension if the academic board considers your concerns.
28/12/23, 1:43 PM - +263 71 870 6208: Honestly speaking now my family is having financial instabilities so the registration fee is kinda heavy for us to pay within a short period of time mentioned above  because 900 USD  its more way than  my mother receives a month
28/12/23, 1:45 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @263718706208 I completely understand and thank you for letting me know that, please do not worry the above dates mentioned are just an example for your understanding and with me here to assist you I will make sure that we work on this together so that you do not go through this concern, you just need to keep your faith in us.
28/12/23, 1:46 PM - +263 71 870 6208: Okay thanks
28/12/23, 1:50 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
28/12/23, 1:53 PM - +263 71 870 6208: Explain
28/12/23, 1:53 PM - Kirti Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
28/12/23, 1:53 PM - Kirti Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
28/12/23, 1:53 PM - Kirti Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
28/12/23, 1:53 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
28/12/23, 1:59 PM - +263 71 870 6208: Yes
28/12/23, 2:02 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
28/12/23, 2:06 PM - +263 71 870 6208: Yes
28/12/23, 2:27 PM - +263 77 795 2977: Understood
28/12/23, 2:28 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
28/12/23, 2:30 PM - +263 71 870 6208: Yes
28/12/23, 2:34 PM - +263 77 795 2977: Yes
28/12/23, 2:44 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

*1. Reappear in A Level*

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
28/12/23, 2:44 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
28/12/23, 2:45 PM - +263 71 870 6208: Yes i am
28/12/23, 2:46 PM - +263 77 795 2977: Yes
28/12/23, 2:46 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree*

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her/his interest in August 2024 itself.
28/12/23, 2:46 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
28/12/23, 2:47 PM - +263 77 795 2977: Yes
28/12/23, 2:48 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career*

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
28/12/23, 2:52 PM - +263 71 870 6208: Yes
28/12/23, 2:53 PM - +263 71 870 6208: O.k.
28/12/23, 2:53 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
28/12/23, 2:53 PM - +263 71 870 6208: Nope
28/12/23, 3:06 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. As your guardian, I am sure your parents are excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
28/12/23, 3:46 PM - +263 77 795 2977: Yes
28/12/23, 3:47 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to *evaluate their application* after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.

May it be a year filled with new beginnings, opportunities, and the fulfillment of all your dreams and goals.
29/12/23, 4:36 PM - Kirti Edoofa: As I was organizing my day today. In reviewing your scholarship application file, I noticed that there's an outstanding payment of $150 for your Edoofa Enrollment fee due by 4th December 2023. Hence I thought of sharing a gentle reminder about this and checking in to see if you have already made this payment. This will help us to keep your scholarship application file up-to-date and ensure that all is progressing smoothly.

13/1/24, 8:18 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Anesu,

In light of the offer letter you received, I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to you and your family on this remarkable achievement in your academic journey.

Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion for you and your family, and I can only imagine the excitement that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.
13/1/24, 8:18 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you have the letter in your possession, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you've had the chance to go through the offer letter thoroughly? 

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
13/1/24, 8:18 AM - +263 71 870 6208: Morning
13/1/24, 8:19 AM - +263 71 870 6208: Yes noted
13/1/24, 8:21 AM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As we proceed with today's discussion, we will get into the details of this specific offer letter. I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.
13/1/24, 8:21 AM - Kirti Edoofa: The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
13/1/24, 8:23 AM - +263 71 870 6208: Yes
13/1/24, 8:24 AM - +263 77 795 2977: Morning
13/1/24, 8:26 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
13/1/24, 8:26 AM - Kirti Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion -	

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4. You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
13/1/24, 8:28 AM - +263 71 870 6208: Okay
13/1/24, 8:29 AM - Kirti Edoofa: I shall wait for your response to the above questions.
13/1/24, 8:52 AM - +263 71 870 6208: 1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter=$900
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course=September 2024 to July 2027
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)=15 days
4. You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now=$750
13/1/24, 8:57 AM - Kirti Edoofa: @263718706208 please can you check question 3 because the admission processing fee as per the letter is $300?
13/1/24, 9:01 AM - +263 71 870 6208: Okay
13/1/24, 9:02 AM - Kirti Edoofa: As outlined in your offer letter, your course is a three-year program, with each academic year consisting of two semesters, totaling 6 semesters for your degree. 

With the scholarship offered, your tuition fee per semester reduces to $900, which means your annual tuition fee (calculated as $900 * 2) is $1800. I hope this clarifies the tuition fee structure for you?
13/1/24, 9:03 AM - +263 71 870 6208: Yes
13/1/24, 9:08 AM - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased that we've been able to make progress. Moving forward, I would like to help you with a concise overview of the two accommodation options available at Galgotias University -
13/1/24, 9:08 AM - Kirti Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
13/1/24, 9:09 AM - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You will be able to seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also go for accommodation independently and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
13/1/24, 9:19 AM - +263 71 870 6208: Okay noted
13/1/24, 9:20 AM - +263 71 870 6208: Now that my results are out are you  going to increase the percentage of the scholarship
13/1/24, 9:53 AM - Kirti Edoofa: @263718706208  For me to help you understand this concern better. We understand that you, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?
13/1/24, 9:56 AM - +263 71 870 6208: <Media omitted>
13/1/24, 9:56 AM - +263 71 870 6208: Okay noted
13/1/24, 9:57 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your results, and congratulations on successfully clearing all your A-Level subjects! Your hard work over the past few months has truly paid off.

I'm sure your family is immensely proud of your achievements. Your A-level results have been duly noted, and we will promptly add them to your scholarship application. This will enable us to engage in discussions with the academic board and chart the best course of action for your next steps.
13/1/24, 9:58 AM - +263 71 870 6208: Okay thanks
13/1/24, 10:01 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Now let me help you understand since your results came out yesterday only the re-evaluation will not be possible right now as it takes time since the university has already offered you a scholarship, plus considering that you have the endowment benefits right which is the $100 grant if you tend to wait for re-evaluation and continue to move forward with the standard admission process you will end up losing the endowment benefits. So my advice regarding your admission offer is to understand the letter better now because I will never want you to miss out on the endowment benefit.
13/1/24, 10:02 AM - +263 71 870 6208: Okay thanks
13/1/24, 10:03 AM - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. So may If you are ready to proceed with the discussion now?
13/1/24, 10:06 AM - +263 71 870 6208: Yes
13/1/24, 10:06 AM - Kirti Edoofa: It is great to hear that you're following our conversation closely. I am sure you can see that Galgotias University values students' well-being and takes a thoughtful approach to accommodation arrangements.

They understand the significance of students feeling comfortable in their environment to excel academically. Instead of imposing choices, the university allows students to visit the campus, assess their options, and make informed decisions about whether they prefer on-campus or off-campus accommodation.

I hope this clarifies the university's approach to accommodation for you?
13/1/24, 10:36 AM - +263 71 870 6208: Yes
13/1/24, 10:42 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Moving forward, as you can see in your offer letter, you have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with the registration fee due as well?
13/1/24, 10:49 AM - +263 77 795 2977: It's OK you can go ahead
13/1/24, 10:50 AM - +263 71 870 6208: Yes
13/1/24, 10:50 AM - +263 77 795 2977: We will work flat out to make sure the girl progresses well
13/1/24, 10:51 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, it is reassuring to see you following through. Please allow me to share some great news with you. As you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300, mentioned in the letter, has been entirely waived under the Early Registration Scheme and the Endowment Plan. This means it will not be added to your overall cost of education.
13/1/24, 10:51 AM - Kirti Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on January 26th 2024*. I hope we are together so far?
13/1/24, 10:52 AM - +263 71 870 6208: Yes we are
13/1/24, 10:52 AM - +263 71 870 6208: We have to pay it all or in halves
13/1/24, 10:52 AM - Kirti Edoofa: In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $100 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
13/1/24, 10:52 AM - +263 77 795 2977: Yes
13/1/24, 10:53 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $100 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $650  of the registration fee. This $650 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$325 before the first deadline date of January 26, 2024* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$325  before the second deadline date of February 26, 2024* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
13/1/24, 10:53 AM - Kirti Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $650 within 15 working days, before *January 26th, 2024*. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
13/1/24, 10:56 AM - +263 71 870 6208: Yes
13/1/24, 10:56 AM - +263 71 870 6208: Sure
13/1/24, 10:57 AM - +263 77 795 2977: May the Lord bless the owners of this program im relieved
13/1/24, 10:57 AM - +263 77 795 2977: Thank you once again
13/1/24, 10:58 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for your kind words and you are most welcome. Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
13/1/24, 10:58 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
13/1/24, 10:58 AM - +263 77 795 2977: This program was meant for me 😭😭😭
13/1/24, 10:59 AM - +263 77 795 2977: Yes Harare,Ruwa
13/1/24, 11:00 AM - +263 71 870 6208: Ruwa Dammafalls
13/1/24, 11:02 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
13/1/24, 11:03 AM - Kirti Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
13/1/24, 11:03 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
13/1/24, 4:38 PM - +263 77 795 2977: Thank you
15/1/24, 8:48 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Anesu.

I hope you are doing well. Since we were unable to continue with our discussion previously I will be connecting with you today at 12:30 pm CAT.
15/1/24, 9:06 AM - +263 71 870 6208: Okay noted
15/1/24, 9:44 AM - +263 77 795 2977: Ok
15/1/24, 12:39 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @263718706208 may I know if you are available to connect with us now so that we can continue with our discussion?
15/1/24, 12:42 PM - +263 77 795 2977: I'm available just network is slow
15/1/24, 12:44 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I completely understand that network can be a challenge, may I know if you are comfortable proceeding with the discussion?
15/1/24, 12:55 PM - +263 71 870 6208: Yes
15/1/24, 12:55 PM - +263 71 870 6208: Yes
15/1/24, 12:57 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing. Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
15/1/24, 12:57 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. charles ecocash for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
15/1/24, 12:58 PM - +263 71 870 6208: Noted
15/1/24, 1:01 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Let me do the same. If making the payment through Mr. Charles ecocash is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

15/1/24, 1:04 PM - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome, now moving forward, to facilitate a simpler understanding, let me provide a summary of all the fee components we have discussed and share the total cost of education that you are expected to incur at Galgotias University:

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1,800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1,800 + $200 + $800 = $2,800
17/1/24, 1:39 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon parents and Anesu,

I hope this message finds you in good health. I wanted to check in following the message I sent previously. I haven't received a response yet and thought perhaps my message didn't reach you.

With that in mind, I'm reaching out again to see if you had the opportunity to go through my previous message and to ascertain if we are still connected with each other?
17/1/24, 1:39 PM - +263 71 870 6208: We are connected
17/1/24, 1:41 PM - Kirti Edoofa: So may I know if you were able to take a note of this break up?
17/1/24, 1:46 PM - +263 71 870 6208: Yes
17/1/24, 1:48 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to see that you were able to follow through with our last message. Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $2800, let me also guide you on how we can make your education more affordable.
17/1/24, 1:48 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
17/1/24, 1:48 PM - Kirti Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn.
17/1/24, 1:48 PM - Kirti Edoofa: The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. I hope you have understood this?
17/1/24, 1:50 PM - +263 71 870 6208: Yes
17/1/24, 1:51 PM - Kirti Edoofa: With this said, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that you with your hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.
17/1/24, 1:51 PM - Kirti Edoofa: With these earned credits, you can use this $1000 to cover a portion of your annual fee, which is $2800. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $2800 - $1000 = $1800, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.
17/1/24, 1:51 PM - Kirti Edoofa: This illustrates how you can effectively make your education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
17/1/24, 2:16 PM - +263 71 870 6208: Yes
17/1/24, 2:16 PM - Kirti Edoofa: It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education while balancing your academics. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.
17/1/24, 2:16 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now, that you have all the details with you and understand the letter better, I would like to enquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
17/1/24, 2:54 PM - +263 71 870 6208: Would like to know that are you gonna increase the percentage of the scholarship since my results are out
17/1/24, 3:01 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @263718706208 As I mentioned previously. Regarding your application, once we submit your results to the university, your application will be re-evaluated. As you have been granted the Endowment Plan benefit, we recommend completing the registration formalities now. If we submit your application for re-evaluation, you may lose the Endowment Benefits due to the time taken by the university to evaluate your application. May I know if you are clear now?
17/1/24, 3:10 PM - +263 71 870 6208: Yes
17/1/24, 3:10 PM - +263 71 870 6208: Am I allowed to switch universities
17/1/24, 3:16 PM - +263 77 795 2977: Afternoon Kirti
17/1/24, 4:22 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Let me address this query of yours by helping you understand how a student's university admission process is carried out.
17/1/24, 4:23 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Scholarship Program is a merit-based scholarship, and hence a student's application is shared with multiple universities that are recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board after considering a student's eligibility, along with the university's ranking and affordability.
17/1/24, 4:23 PM - Kirti Edoofa: After we share the application with the universities, it is on the admissions team of the university to accept or reject an application, and the decision to offer a scholarship depends on them. If you have any university on your mind, you can let me know and we will surely look into your inclinations as well.
17/1/24, 4:23 PM - Kirti Edoofa: As of now, your application has been only accepted by the Galgotias and since we have shared your application with multiple universities, we are also hoping to receive updates from multiple universities. Once we get the same, we will surely inform you, but each university takes its own time to consider the application and so you have to be patient while the universities are evaluating the application. 

I hope you are clear about this now?
17/1/24, 4:28 PM - +263 71 870 6208: Yes very
17/1/24, 4:37 PM - +263 77 795 2977: That's a brilliant idea
17/1/24, 4:37 PM - +263 77 795 2977: Thank you
17/1/24, 4:42 PM - Kirti Edoofa: As you know that each university takes its own time to evaluate an application, In that case, if you wish to wait for an update from let us say University A and end up missing the opportunity given by Galgotias, you would lose out on the scholarship from Galgotias and won't be able to join it in the future. 

To help you with that, there is a transfer option available to the students. Are you aware of that?
17/1/24, 4:49 PM - +263 71 870 6208: Nope
24/1/24, 12:50 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Anesu,

I trust you're all having a good day. I want to start by apologizing for my absence over the past week. Unfortunately, I was unwell with a severe ENT infection, which required me to rest as per my doctor's advice. Thankfully, I'm feeling much improved now and am eager to reconnect with you so we can continue our discussions. But before we proceed, I'm curious to hear about how your last week went?
24/1/24, 4:22 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, since we were unable to complete our letter discussion so let us plan to connect today at 06:00 pm CAT, so I can help you understand the offer letter better. I hope you will be available.
24/1/24, 4:59 PM - +263 71 870 6208: Yes
24/1/24, 6:20 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, with regard to our conversation earlier, may I know if you are available to connect with us now so that we can connect and continue with our discussion?
24/1/24, 7:01 PM - +263 71 870 6208: Can we reschedule to 8
24/1/24, 7:02 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Surely we can, let us reconnect at 08:00 pm today.
24/1/24, 7:11 PM - +263 71 870 6208: Okay thanks
24/1/24, 7:49 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
24/1/24, 7:56 PM - +263 71 870 6208: Yes am ready
24/1/24, 8:06 PM - +263 71 870 6208: Are we still doing lesson
24/1/24, 8:15 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that, since you said you were not aware of the transfer option may I know if you will like to know more?
24/1/24, 8:22 PM - +263 71 870 6208: Yes
24/1/24, 8:23 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you understand about the Transfer Option better -

Without any worries/concerns, you can go ahead and reserve your scholarship seat with Galgotias by paying your registration fee due. 

If and when in the future, you get a better scholarship offer and wish to change your university, in that case, you would have the opportunity to change your university without paying any additional amount of money.

If you do not get a better scholarship offer, in that case, you will be able to pursue your education at Galgotias without risking losing out on the scholarship.
24/1/24, 8:24 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you understand it with an example as well - 

Let us say you have paid $750 to Galgotias to reserve your seat with the university and after that, you get a better offer from University A where your registration fee is again $750.

If you wish to change your university to University A, in that case, one is to pay $750, but because you would have already paid $750 for Galgotias, the same amount would be adjusted against your fee of $750 at University A and so you will not have to pay any other additional of money to reserve your scholarship seat with University or to change your university. 

I hope you are clear with this and have a better understanding?
24/1/24, 8:31 PM - +263 71 870 6208: Yes
24/1/24, 8:31 PM - +263 71 870 6208: Okay
24/1/24, 8:32 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. Now to attend to last part of our discussion, let me share a few insights into Galgotias University with you -
24/1/24, 8:32 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Galgotias University, situated in Delhi NCR, boasts an impressive academic reputation, ranking among the top 100 universities in India. One of its notable achievements is obtaining NAAC A+ Accreditation in the First Cycle, setting the highest standard for academic excellence.

A significant factor contributing to Galgotias University's consistent recognition as a top institution is its 'students-first' philosophy. This approach prioritizes the well-being and success of its students and aligns with Edoofa's values and mission.

Considering the same, I wanted to reach out to you, share a gentle reminder, and try to understand if you have been able to make the payment of your fee by now so that we can update the academic board and the university officials accordingly?
31/1/24, 6:08 PM - +263 77 795 2977: Yes we are supposed to do that but was a bit tied up will do the half payment next week school opened between the month of January we paid fees for Anesu 's brother
