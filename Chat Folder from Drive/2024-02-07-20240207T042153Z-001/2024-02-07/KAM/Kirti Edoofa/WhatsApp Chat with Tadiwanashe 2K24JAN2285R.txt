I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them. 

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
5/2/24, 7:20 PM - +263 78 633 8964: Yes you can
5/2/24, 7:20 PM - +263 77 395 2774: Lets start
5/2/24, 7:21 PM - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
5/2/24, 7:23 PM - +263 78 633 8964: Go ahead
5/2/24, 7:31 PM - +263 77 395 2774: Done
5/2/24, 7:31 PM - +263 77 395 2774: My netwk is lagging behind you can move on I follow if I have any questions I will ask
5/2/24, 7:36 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
5/2/24, 7:36 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
5/2/24, 7:39 PM - +263 78 633 8964: Understood
5/2/24, 7:39 PM - +263 77 395 2774: Clear so far
5/2/24, 7:40 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
5/2/24, 7:40 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
5/2/24, 7:43 PM - +263 77 395 2774: On it
5/2/24, 7:43 PM - +263 78 633 8964: Still following
5/2/24, 7:44 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process, the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
5/2/24, 7:44 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
5/2/24, 7:47 PM - +263 78 633 8964: Got it
5/2/24, 7:50 PM - +263 77 395 2774: What is the time line for paying registration fee?
5/2/24, 7:51 PM - +263 77 395 2774: I mean how soon or what is the deadline for raising the university registration fee?
5/2/24, 7:57 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Please note that this is just a brief understanding of what your admission process holds, you will be explained each and every step in detail as we move forward, I would appreciate you being patient, please.

Now if we are clear shall we move ahead?
5/2/24, 8:10 PM - +263 77 395 2774: Lets move on
5/2/24, 8:11 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
5/2/24, 8:12 PM - +263 77 395 2774: Yes
5/2/24, 8:13 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
5/2/24, 8:13 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding until you are ready, shall we start with our discussion with me individually?
5/2/24, 8:23 PM - +263 78 633 8964: You may share

6/2/24, 1:21 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. Let me share my views as well so that it will help you expand your understanding.

*Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students:* In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. 

You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent.
6/2/24, 1:21 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s vision for you:* Here our founders talk about the most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
6/2/24, 1:21 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program:* Talking about the third video, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
6/2/24, 1:21 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP:* Another thing is that Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based. 

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
