I trust this message finds you in good health. As we step into the second week of January, I wanted to reach out and share an exciting milestone that India as a country achieved within the first week of 2024 - the successful India's Chandrayaan-3 Engine Test.
12/1/24, 5:56 PM - Kirti Edoofa: This accomplishment is responsible for the third lunar mission, aiming to land a rover on the Moon's south polar region and conduct scientific studies that could check Moon's viability to sustain life. It signifies a significant scientific advancement, laying the groundwork for future progress.
12/1/24, 5:56 PM - Kirti Edoofa: This achievement has not only pushed boundaries but also inspired young minds all over the world to pursue their dreams. On the same note, I wanted to extend my heartiest wishes for the New Year to you and your family and check in to see how you and your family started your year?

25/1/24, 11:54 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Tanyaradzwa,

I hope this message finds you all well and in high spirits. I apologize for not being in touch over the past few days. Unfortunately, I was dealing with a significant ENT infection and needed to follow my doctor's recommendation for rest, which meant taking some time off to prioritize my health. As a result, I was unable to inform you about my temporary absence. Thankfully, I'm feeling considerably better now and am ready to resume our interactions. Before we proceed with our discussion, I'd like to catch up - how have you and your family been lately?
25/1/24, 7:55 PM - +263 77 463 9366: How are you feeling now

25/1/24, 9:23 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I can clearly see that you have understood the process really well. Moving forward I would like to inquire if you have any queries or concerns that you would like to share regarding the registration process?
25/1/24, 9:28 PM - +263 77 463 9366: No don't have any if they come up will just ask
25/1/24, 9:28 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, Now with this, we are done with step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*.

25/1/24, 9:48 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I was hoping to get a response from you, however, given that it's been a long day for me, along with the conclusion of our working hours, let's plan to reconnect tomorrow to continue our discussion.

25/1/24, 9:49 PM - +263 77 463 9366: Okay will chat tomorrow
26/1/24, 11:47 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Tanyaradzwa.

I hope you are doing well. With regard to our conversation yesterday since we were not able to move further with our discussion may I know if you are available to connect with us now so that we can continue with our discussion?
2/2/24, 3:39 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Tanyaradzwa.

I hope you are doing well.  I'm writing to follow up on the messages shared above. I noticed that you have not responded to the message above.

Therefore, I am reaching out to you once more to inquire if you have had a chance to read my earlier message and to confirm whether we are still in communication.
2/2/24, 4:43 PM - +263 77 463 9366: How are you ma'am
2/2/24, 6:07 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for asking, I am doing great may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
2/2/24, 6:17 PM - +263 77 463 9366: Yes we can get connected
2/2/24, 6:23 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing. As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received special news for the students of the 2024 admission intake. May I know if you are excited to know the news we have for you?
2/2/24, 6:24 PM - +263 77 463 9366: Yes l would really want to hear the news
2/2/24, 6:25 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am happy to see that you are excited. After speaking with thousands of students and parents who completed their admission process before you, we realized that the current economic situation in African countries makes it a bit challenging for parents to pay the full registration fee at once. 

In response to the same challenge, we had a detailed discussion with the academic board and university official. As a result, we developed a solution to alleviate the financial burden of the parents specifically for the registration fee due of $500 to $750.
2/2/24, 6:25 PM - Kirti Edoofa: We at Edoofa are thrilled about this development, and I believe it will significantly help all of our students and their families. Are you aware of the solution?
2/2/24, 6:27 PM - +263 77 463 9366: Yeah sure its a good adjustment
2/2/24, 6:42 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright, let me share the same. With respect to the conversation we had with the academic board and the university officials, we requested them to allow the students to make the payment of their registration fee in two parts within a span of 45 days thereby reducing the financial pressure.
2/2/24, 6:42 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: Consider that your registration fee is $750. After you will receive the offer letter, the first part of the registration fees which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, i.e. $375 needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university (For most of the universities 15 days). Subsequently, the second part of $375, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
2/2/24, 6:43 PM - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for February 15, 2024, and your registration fee stands at $750, you'll need to make a payment of $375 on or before February 15, 2024. The remaining $375 should be paid by March 15, 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
5/2/24, 4:27 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon parents and Tanyaradzwa,

I hope this message finds you well. I'm circling back regarding the earlier message I shared. While I was anticipating a response, it appears that my messages might not have reached you.

Hence, I'm reaching out today to inquire if you had the opportunity to review my previous message and to confirm if our communication is still ongoing.
5/2/24, 4:27 PM - +263 77 463 9366: How are you
5/2/24, 4:44 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am doing good, thank you for asking, may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
6/2/24, 6:33 AM - +263 77 463 9366: Sorry wasn't available
6/2/24, 6:45 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Tanyaradzwa.

I hope you are doing well. Since we were not able to connect yesterday may I know if you are available to connect with us now so that we can continue with our discussion?
6/2/24, 7:13 PM - +263 77 463 9366: Yes
6/2/24, 7:15 PM - Kirti Edoofa: So may I know if you are clear so far?
6/2/24, 7:16 PM - +263 77 463 9366: Yes
6/2/24, 7:20 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. As your guardian, I am sure your parents are excited to initiate the process? For the current round of admissions, only 31 scholarship seats are available and hence let us begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the payment plan offered for the registration fee. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
6/2/24, 7:24 PM - +263 77 463 9366: Okay taking that into account
6/2/24, 7:27 PM - Kirti Edoofa: With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to *evaluate your application* after which if they accept your application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
6/2/24, 7:28 PM - +263 77 463 9366: Okay thank you very much will be waiting for the offer letter
6/2/24, 7:28 PM - +263 77 463 9366: Have a good night too
