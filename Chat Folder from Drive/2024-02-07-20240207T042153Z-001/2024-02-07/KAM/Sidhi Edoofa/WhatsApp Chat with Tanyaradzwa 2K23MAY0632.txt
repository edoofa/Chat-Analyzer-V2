16/1/24, 12:05 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Tanyaradzwa,

I trust this message finds you well, and I hope you are in high spirits. In recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their A-Level results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey.
16/1/24, 12:05 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?

23/1/24, 1:32 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Tanyaradzwa.

Thank you for sharing your results, and congratulations on successfully clearing all your A-Level subjects with flying colours! Your hard work over the past few months has truly paid off.

I am sure your family is immensely proud of your achievements. Your A-level results have been duly noted, and we will quickly add them to your scholarship application. This will enable us to engage in discussions with the academic board and chart the best course of action for your next steps.
23/1/24, 1:32 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Kindly allow us some time to thoroughly evaluate your results and plan the way forward. Once we have re-evaluated your application, along with all the other applications, we will reconnect with you to discuss the next steps in your academic journey.
23/1/24, 4:50 PM - +263 78 705 3454: Ok thank you
23/1/24, 4:50 PM - +263 78 705 3454: But l have another issue
2/2/24, 6:29 AM - +263 78 705 3454: Morning
2/2/24, 10:39 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Tanyaradzwa.

I hope you are having a wonderful morning. How may I help you today?
2/2/24, 10:46 AM - +263 78 705 3454: I had any issue
I need to change the program that l have choose at first
2/2/24, 1:25 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that Tanyaradzwa. May I know what course do you want to change to and why did this shift in your decision happen?
2/2/24, 1:27 PM - +263 78 705 3454: I need to shift from Chemical engineering to medicine because l later realized that in my home country the job opportunities for engineering are very slim
2/2/24, 1:37 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. Since you are aiming to pursue your higher education abroad, may I know if you intend to return to your country for employment? Once you graduate with a degree from India, it will be globally acceptable and you will find job opportunities across the world, even in developed countries like USA and UK.
2/2/24, 1:40 PM - +263 78 705 3454: Not as soon as I finish bt letter on l would like to return to my home country
2/2/24, 2:13 PM - +263 78 705 3454: In addition
When l was doing my counseling session l was told that if you do chemical engineering you gonna work as a pharmacist bt when l carried out research when l had no pressure with school,l found out that it's impossible to specialize on pharmacy if you're a chemical engineer
2/2/24, 3:16 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. I was having a conversation with your counsellor, Mr. Shubham, and he gave me a few insights about your conversation. He mentioned that you have an inclination towards creating medicine and that is why you voluntarily chose to pursue Chemical Engineering. May I know if the information that I have is correct?
2/2/24, 7:05 PM - +263 78 705 3454: Unfortunately I no longer have my chats l would have showed you
2/2/24, 7:05 PM - +263 78 705 3454: We didn't discuss about doing medicine
2/2/24, 8:22 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand, Tanyaradzwa. Let us reconnect tomorrow during the day to discuss your concern regarding the course change.

I wish you a blessed night!
2/2/24, 8:53 PM - +263 78 705 3454: Ok thank you ma'am
3/2/24, 7:04 AM - +263 78 705 3454: Morning
3/2/24, 10:22 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Tanyaradzwa. How are you all doing this fine morning?
3/2/24, 10:23 AM - +263 78 705 3454: I doing well
3/2/24, 10:38 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Right Tanyaradzwa, we were discussing about your change of decision. I understand that you did not discuss about pursuing medicine as a discipline. May I know what aspects did you discuss with your counsellor?
3/2/24, 10:41 AM - +263 78 705 3454: We discussed about Pharmacy and l was told that if l do. Chemical engineering l gonna specializ in Pharmacy
3/2/24, 10:59 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. I had a detailed discussion with Mr. Shubham who was your counsellor, and he mentioned that you had displayed a passion towards Chemical Engineering with an inclination towards going into the pharmaceutical sector. However, since you displayed such a strong inclination towards pursuing chemical engineering, you were offered the same course.
3/2/24, 11:00 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Having said that, if you wish to pursue pharmaceuticals, with your subject combination you are definitely eligible for the same. If you wish to change your course from Chemical Engineering to Pharmacy, kindly let me know so I can guide you accordingly.
3/2/24, 11:26 AM - +263 78 705 3454: Yes he's right
3/2/24, 11:27 AM - +263 78 705 3454: I thought phamacetical was the same as pharmacy bt now l want to shift to medicine
3/2/24, 11:32 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. May I know why you wish to switch your course to medicine? Could you kindly explain what particularly interests you about the field?
3/2/24, 11:46 AM - +263 78 705 3454: The most valuable degree in my home country now is medicine
3/2/24, 11:49 AM - +263 78 705 3454: My passion is also of working with patients and also in my home country there are poor health services and I wish to improve them because I wish to work in a foreign country like Australia to raise money to have a private surgery in my home country
3/2/24, 11:51 AM - +263 78 705 3454: I don't know if the Edoofa board will seek  employment for me in those countries after my tertiary education
3/2/24, 12:07 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand Tanyaradzwa. However, if my understanding is correct, Mr. Shubham mentioned that you said that you do not want to be a doctor and that you are more interested towards creating medicine that can help people and improve their lives. Could you kindly help me understand what caused a sudden change in your interests Tanyaradzwa?
3/2/24, 3:29 PM - +263 78 705 3454: Yes he was right but it was because of some discouragements from some friends
4/2/24, 8:59 AM - +263 78 705 3454: Mrng
5/2/24, 3:55 PM - +263 78 705 3454: Afternoon
5/2/24, 4:11 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Tanyaradzwa.

I hope you all had a great weekend. I was unable to respond to your last message on Saturday as our operational hours on Saturdays are from 8:00 AM to 1:00 PM.
5/2/24, 4:11 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I see Tanyaradzwa. Could you kindly help me understand what you mean by discouragement from friends? How did they discourage you? <This message was edited>
5/2/24, 4:12 PM - +263 78 705 3454: I have heard that it is too difficult
5/2/24, 4:41 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Your friends discouraged you to pursue medicine by saying that it is too difficult. Is my understanding correct, Tanyaradzwa?
5/2/24, 5:05 PM - +263 78 705 3454: Bt now l can see that nothing comes easy everything needs to hardworking so l wish to shift from chemical engineering to medicine
6/2/24, 9:55 AM - +263 78 705 3454: Good morning
6/2/24, 10:26 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Tanyaradzwa.

I hope you are all doing well today.

I understand your concern Tanyaradzwa. However, it is also my understanding that you have a strong interest in pharmacy. May I know if I am correct?
6/2/24, 11:49 AM - +263 78 705 3454: Yes by that time l have that interest bt now l wish to change
6/2/24, 11:50 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand. Your subject combination for A-Level examinations are Mathematics, Physics and Chemistry. May I know if I am correct?
6/2/24, 11:54 AM - +263 78 705 3454: Yes you are right
6/2/24, 12:08 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that. In such a case Tanyaradzwa, I would like to inform you that in order to pursue medicine in India, you are required to have Biology in your subject combination. Since you do not have Biology as a subject in your A-Level examinations, I am afraid that you are not eligible to pursue medicine. However, I am glad to let you know that your subject combination make you eligible to pursue pharmacy. May I know if you are interested in going forward with it?
6/2/24, 12:10 PM - +263 78 705 3454: But l need to try medicine first
6/2/24, 1:34 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand, Tanyaradzwa. Pursuing medicine is indeed a significant commitment, typically spanning an 8-year journey that requires unwavering dedication. However, given that Biology is not part of your subject combination, your foundational understanding of human anatomy may not be sufficient. Hence as Biology is a requirement in A-Level, I am afraid that you are not eligible to pursue medicine in India. As you may be aware, India's healthcare sector is highly regarded globally, making medicine one of the most sought-after degrees. To pursue medicine in India, students must clear a national-level examination known as NEET, with eligibility typically extending to those who achieve above the 99th percentile.
6/2/24, 1:34 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: May I know if you have been able to do some research about the same? And I could not quite understand what you meant by saying that you need to try medicine first. To help me understand it better, could you also elaborate on the same?
6/2/24, 2:40 PM - +263 78 705 3454: I get it
6/2/24, 2:42 PM - +263 78 705 3454: But after l finish my territory, how will I be going to find a job in a foreign country like UK as you said..
Will l seek for the job on my own or the Edoofa board will do it for me
6/2/24, 3:04 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Surely let me help you with your concern here. After completing your studies in India you will be employable globally. All the universities that are associated with Edoofa are recognized on a global level and hence the degrees shared by them are accepted worldwide. As you may know, each university offers courses with varying durations. In Zimbabwe, it is referred to as *industrial attachment* or *work internships*. India refers to it as " placements." Every university affiliated with the Edoofa Program has its own dedicated placement cell. Their primary mission is to ensure that all students secure placements in their pre-final year of education. <This message was edited>
6/2/24, 3:04 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: When students reach their pre-final year, they participate in placement drives conducted by various multinational corporations, startups, and organizations. During these drives, students go through interviews, and if they demonstrate proficiency, they end up receiving job offers from these companies. Depending on the job offer, students have the option to apply for a work permit that allows them to extend their stay in India for the duration of their employment.
6/2/24, 3:04 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Moreover, the EWYL program for you is specifically designed so that you as a student are able to learn the 21st-century skills which are certainly required for every student to be employable ready. Through EWYL you will boost your confidence which is going to help you in the future and with the skills learned you will definitely be employable ready. It depends upon the student how much they are willing to learn from the program.
6/2/24, 3:05 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I hope this provides the clarity you were seeking. Could you kindly help me out with the message I had previously shared with you Tanyaradzwa?
6/2/24, 3:06 PM - +263 78 705 3454: I was thinking that l gonna have the chance to do medicine
6/2/24, 3:07 PM - +263 78 705 3454: Which means the only way you can get a job is through passing interview during attachments
6/2/24, 3:27 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is indeed correct. You will be given the opportunities to get employed with the top companies, and it will depend on you whether you are able to capitalize on it and get selected for the role.
6/2/24, 3:28 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. However, via pharmacy you can still pursue your dream of helping out the patients. You have an inclination towards making medicine as well. I am sure that you will be able to excel in this field! What are your thoughts on this?
6/2/24, 4:10 PM - +263 78 705 3454: It's good as well but l need to know also for how long will it take to study pharmacy in India
6/2/24, 4:11 PM - +263 78 705 3454: These companies are where you will be given chance to be employed as soon as you finish tertiary education are only in India or even in Europe
