I hope you are clear about the purpose of the two groups.

Speaking of valuable opportunities, I am also curious to learn more about your counselling session with your counsellor and to understand which aspects of the Edoofa Scholarship Program have particularly impressed you thus far. Can you share this with me?

It has been a week since we began our admission process, and it seems like due to some challenges we are unable to connect with each other and move forward. As Violet's admission officer, I am a bit concerned about the same since I do not want Violet to miss out on the scholarship opportunity. In order to ensure that, we need to cooperate and work together. May I know if you are facing any challenges that are causing a hindrance in our schedule?
