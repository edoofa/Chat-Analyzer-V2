26/1/24, 4:32 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Moving forward in today's session, we will discuss a bit about your university admission journey. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts. I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them.

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
26/1/24, 4:34 PM - +265 999 52 82 02: Yes am ready...lets move on madam
26/1/24, 4:37 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
26/1/24, 4:41 PM - +265 999 52 82 02: Yes I've studied it
26/1/24, 4:43 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
26/1/24, 4:43 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
26/1/24, 4:47 PM - +265 999 52 82 02: Yes they're clear madam
26/1/24, 4:49 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps - 

*Step 3: Introduction to the Financial Secure Plan* - Parents with children embarking on their university journey within the next one to two years face important decision-making and rigorous financial planning. Edoofa recognizes the significance of this transition and hence has introduced the Edoofa Secure Plan - a unique and systematic strategy to empower parents in financial planning and preparing for their child's tertiary education well in advance.
26/1/24, 4:49 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Scholarship Offer Letter from the university would be issued next year in the month of August.

I hope you are following?
26/1/24, 4:51 PM - +265 999 52 82 02: Quite rightly madam... following indeed
26/1/24, 4:52 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. The registration fee will be paid through the savings you have accumulated visa the Financial Secure Plan. After the registration fee is paid, for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
26/1/24, 4:52 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
26/1/24, 4:57 PM - +265 999 52 82 02: Yes it s clear madam
26/1/24, 4:57 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through all 6 steps, if we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
26/1/24, 4:58 PM - +265 999 52 82 02: Yes 

Let's go on madam
26/1/24, 5:02 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
26/1/24, 5:02 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding. Until you are ready, shall we start with our discussion with me individually? 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
26/1/24, 5:04 PM - +265 999 52 82 02: Yes am ready madam..send them please
26/1/24, 5:06 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>

26/1/24, 5:07 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection. 

Please go through the 4 videos, our next session will be scheduled for tomorrow after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarize your understanding. Hence I would like to know by when do you think you will be able to go through these videos so that we can schedule our next session accordingly?
26/1/24, 5:16 PM - +265 999 52 82 02: We can continue from 3pm madam tomorrow if it's okay with you over there.
26/1/24, 5:28 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is wonderful to hear. In that case, we will be concluding the conversation for now and we will reconnect tomorrow at 3:00 PM for our next session. 

I hope by then you will be able to go through the videos. If you have any queries or concerns before then, feel free to share them here in your admission group. Wish you a blessed day ahead and please ensure to extend our regards to your family as well.
26/1/24, 5:29 PM - +265 999 52 82 02: Thanks and have a wonderful afternoon
27/1/24, 2:49 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Mr. & Mr.s Labanna and Winnie. I hope you are having a lovely day. How are you all doing today?

27/1/24, 3:59 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. Could you kindly share your understanding of each video sir?

27/1/24, 4:32 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in Winnie's admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier.

2/2/24, 3:45 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: However, before we start the same, I was going through your scholarship application file and noticed that you are supposed to make the payment of your remaining part of Edoofa Enrollment fee.

2/2/24, 7:49 PM - +265 999 52 82 02: Thanks and good night too
3/2/24, 9:57 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Winnie. How are you all doing this fine morning?
3/2/24, 10:37 AM - +265 999 52 82 02: We're doing fine ,what about yourself over there?
3/2/24, 10:47 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. I am well too, thank you for asking. Let us move forward with our discussion today. To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is BCom and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2025. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
3/2/24, 11:03 AM - +265 999 52 82 02: Yes it is..


But can we continue at around 3pm as am on duty right now?
3/2/24, 11:09 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. On Saturdays, our operational hours are from 8:00 AM to 1:00 PM as it is a weekend. If you are unable to proceed with the discussion currently, would it be more suitable for you if we reconnect on Monday at 3:00 PM?

3/2/24, 11:18 AM - +265 999 52 82 02: Monday it's fine
3/2/24, 11:27 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that sir. I will look forward to our session on Monday.

I wish you a blessed weekend ahead!
6/2/24, 2:52 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Winnie.

I hope that you are all doing wonderful today. How has your day been going so far?
6/2/24, 3:11 PM - +265 999 52 82 02: Everything is on course sure what about yourself there?
6/2/24, 3:58 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Everything is good here as well, thank you for asking. During our previous session, you had confirmed your chosen course and year of intake. Thank you for your confirmation. Based on our experience of over 14 years and having assisted over 5000 students from different countries, we have realized that financial planning is the most important factor when a student plans for their higher education abroad.
6/2/24, 3:58 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am sure that you must be aware that 20-30% of students who are admitted into universities abroad are unable to fulfill their dream and come to India due to a lack of financial planning. The funds needed for booking flights, accommodation, and covering living expenses after arrival often become overwhelming, leading to the decision to defer their admission for a year. This, in turn, creates a gap in the child's education.
6/2/24, 3:58 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: To assist both students and parents in this regard, Edoofa Management has designed a Financial Secure Plan that aims to help you prepare for your higher educational finances without experiencing stress or last-minute rushes. I believe you must be wondering about the details of the same plan and how it helps the parents?
6/2/24, 4:01 PM - +265 999 52 82 02: Yes for sure...but I know that probably you've an alternative to this may be?
6/2/24, 4:16 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I could not quite understand what you mean to say by alternative here. Could you kindly elaborate sir?
6/2/24, 4:25 PM - +265 999 52 82 02: I mean the assistance by securing a financial plan do that parents like myself should at least be not burdened for the expenses as expressed above
6/2/24, 4:52 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Yes, Edoofa management has curated a plan that will help the parents and students. Edoofa Secure Plan is important for parents who have children joining the university for tertiary education in the next one to two years for several reasons:
6/2/24, 4:52 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 1. *Financial Preparedness:* The Edoofa Secure plan helps parents prepare financially for the costs after the Scholarship being offered so that they are not caught off guard.

2. *Reduced Financial Stress:* Having the Edoofa Secure Plan in place can significantly reduce the financial stress on you as parents when your child is about to enter university. Knowing that there is a dedicated fund for education expenses provides peace of mind.
6/2/24, 4:52 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 3. *Avoiding Debt*: Without proper savings, some parents may resort to taking out loans or accumulating credit card debt to cover their child's education costs. This Educational savings plan helps avoid the burden of debt and high-interest payments.

4. *Compound Interest:* By starting to save early and consistently contributing to the savings plan, parents can take advantage of compound interest, which can significantly increase the amount available for education expenses.
6/2/24, 4:52 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 5. *Flexibility and Control:* The Edoofa Secure savings plans allow parents to have greater control over their finances and how they allocate funds for their child's education. They can choose investment options that align with their risk tolerance and financial goals.

6. *Encouraging Responsibility*: Involving your child in the process of saving for their education teaches them financial responsibility and the value of higher education. It also motivates them to outperform in Academics.
6/2/24, 4:52 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 7. *Adapting to Unexpected Changes*: Life is full of surprises, and circumstances can change especially when there are political reforms changing each day impacting the Local Currency. Having an Edoofa Secure Plan allows parents to adapt to unexpected changes in their financial situation while still prioritizing their child's education.

8. *Peace of Mind:* Overall, having the Edoofa Secure plan provides parents with peace of mind, knowing that they are actively planning for their child's future and increasing the likelihood of providing them with a solid education.
6/2/24, 4:52 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, when you go through all the above benefits, I am sure you can see that the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan is an important financial tool for parents/students who are supposed to enter the university soon. 

It helps ensure that the financial aspect of tertiary education is well-managed, reduces stress, and allows parents to provide the best opportunities for their children without resorting to debt or financial hardship. Isn't this something you and your family also wish to have?
6/2/24, 5:12 PM - +265 999 52 82 02: Yes ... surely so
6/2/24, 5:13 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through the above points, do you want me to help you understand how the Edoofa Secure Plan works?
6/2/24, 5:13 PM - +265 999 52 82 02: Yes please
6/2/24, 5:18 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This message was deleted
6/2/24, 5:18 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, as you are aware, we are currently in February 2024, and we have a good 20 months to plan for your finances before you start your university education in 2025.
6/2/24, 5:18 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: During the counseling session, you were informed that at Edoofa, we guarantee a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship on the tuition fees. Hence, the cost of education, including food and accommodation after the scholarship, would be between $2000-$3000, and it could be even less. Not more than that.
6/2/24, 5:18 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This means that if you can save $150 per month for the next 20 months, you will be able to save $3000. This amount is more than enough for the first year of university fees, including tuition fees (if any), food, and accommodation. I hope you agree with this?
6/2/24, 5:20 PM - +265 999 52 82 02: Yes I do agree
6/2/24, 5:26 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Right, this means that by the time you would be in India, you would have already saved the $3000 that will cover the first-year fee.
6/2/24, 5:26 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, in these next 20 months, I am sure you would also be engaged in the EWYL program, and if you secure a minimum of $1000 in 20 months, that means the fees for 1.5 years are already secured.
6/2/24, 5:26 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, for a 3-year course, if we follow the same approach for the remaining 1.5 years, the educational journey for the student and the financial journey for the parent will be easy and smooth. I believe you must be able to see this perspective?
6/2/24, 5:32 PM - +265 999 52 82 02: Yes..am following
6/2/24, 5:46 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. I would like to continue with our discussion however my operational hours ended at 5:00 PM. Hence, let us conclude our conversation for today and we will reconnect at our scheduled time tomorrow to continue with our discussion.

Have a blessed evening!
6/2/24, 6:01 PM - +265 999 52 82 02: Thanks and good evening too
