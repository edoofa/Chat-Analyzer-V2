It used for Genetic therapy.
Biotechnology produces biomakers which are used for environmental monitoring.
4/1/24, 3:59 PM - +263 78 810 0185: 3) What is rDNA technology
Recombinant DNA technology comprises altering genetic material outside an organism to obtain enhanced and desired characteristics in living organisms or as their products. This technology involves the insertion of DNA fragments from a variety of sources, having a desirable gene sequence via appropriate vector . Manipulation in organism's genome is carried out either through the introduction of one or several new genes and regulatory elements or by decreasing or blocking the expression of endogenous genes through recombining genes and elements. Enzymatic cleavage is applied to obtain different DNA fragments using restriction endo-nucleases for specific target sequence DNA sites followed by DNA ligase activity to join the fragments to fix the desired gene in vector. The vector is then introduced into a host organism, which is grown to produce multiple copies of the incorporated DNA fragment in culture, and finally clones containing a relevant DNA fragment are selected and harvested. Different types of vectors are used which includes retroviruses, fosmids, cosmids, yeast artificial chromosomes. These vectors are delivered into organism using transformation, electroporation, conjugation and transduction. It has it's applications in agriculture, medicine, environment and food industry.
4/1/24, 4:19 PM - +263 78 810 0185: 4) What is monoclonal antibody technology.
Monoclonal antibody, are antibodies produced artificially through genetic engineering and related techniques such as Hybridoma technology. When activated by an antigen, a circulating B cell multiplies to form a clone of plasma cells, each secreting identical immunoglobulin molecules. It is such immunoglobulins—derived from the descendants of a single B cell—that are called monoclonal antibodies. The monoclonal antibody technology (Hybridoma Technology) follows a series of steps to produce antibodies as follows.
Immunization of mice to stimulate immune response and activate differentiation of B Cells into memory B cells and Plasma B cells.
Isolation of B lymphocytes using density gradient centrifugation.
Fusion of activated B lymphocytes with myeloma cells to create hybridomas.
Selection of Hynridoma cells through culturing the cells for 10 to 14 days. The cells with active HCPRT genes survive and they are selected.
Cloning and propagation follows.
Harvesting is done.
There are different monoclonal antibodies produced such as PD-L1, Nivolumab.
The technology is used to develop antibodies used in treatment and diagnostic of cancers, hematology, inflammatory diseases.
4/1/24, 4:20 PM - +263 78 810 0185: 5)
4/1/24, 4:20 PM - +263 78 810 0185: What do you mean by antisense technology.
Antisense DNA technology is a method used to inhibit or downregulate the synthesis a target protein by using antisense DNA or RNA molecules. An antisense sequence is a DNA or RNA that is perfectly complementary to the target nucleotide sequence present in the cell. There are two possible mechanisms for an antisense effect. The method that relies on targeting of the mRNA is called the antisense strategy. When the double-stranded DNA or genes situated in the nucleus are targeted, the approach is called the antigene strategy. Whereas the antisense strategy is well established with several examples of in vitro and in vivo applications, the antigene approach have limited knowledge. The antisense strategy utilizes the ability of a 100% complementary DNA or RNA sequence to interlock or hybridize with the target mRNA thus inhibiting the translation of the target protein. This inhibition can be achieved either by blocking the binding sites for the 40S ribosomal subunit and for other translation initiation signals. Alternatively, the formation of a double-stranded DNA/RNA complex can render the RNA susceptible to RNase H digestion. The antigene approach is based on the binding of an antisense or sense DNA to the complimentary DNA sequence in the nucleus thus forming a triplex structure. This triplex prevents the transcription of the DNA coding sequence into mRNA.

9/1/24, 9:32 PM - Dev Edoofa: This achievement has not only pushed boundaries but also inspired young minds all over the world to pursue their dreams. On the same note, I wanted to extend my heartiest wishes for the New Year to you and your family and check in to see how you and your family started your year?
10/1/24, 4:21 PM - +263 78 397 9366: That's a great work indeed. Seems like 2024 is taking shape and moving in a good direction for India. It is a true indication that India is best suited for my son to achieve his goals and ambitions. Congratulations for this milestone reached.
12/1/24, 10:06 AM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you so much for the kind wishes I am glad to know that you are confident with your decision to choose India as the country for Nyshadzashe's higher education. I hope you are excited for the new day and most importantly the new year as well. @263783979366 , the new year brings about a transformative mindset in us which may not emphasize immediate changes but a change in the direction that you believe is needed.

If I talk about myself, I have made a resolution to bring more humility in myself and bring about a change in my perspective to be a better version of myself all while ensuring that I help all of our students to achieve their educational goals. With that said, I would like to know what aspirations or a change in your approach towards life you wish to achieve? <This message was edited>
12/1/24, 10:17 AM - +263 78 810 0185: Good morning how are you doing?.
12/1/24, 10:19 AM - +263 78 810 0185: I am grateful to know that. Life is dynamic and every day you learn a new lesson. From that experience i would like to change how i interact with people and i am willing to learn from everyone and approach everything with an open mind.
12/1/24, 4:35 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am delighted to hear that you want to become a better version of yourself by changing your approach towards life and the aspects you need to work on. I must commend this.
12/1/24, 4:36 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, moving towards the admission process, We, at Edoofa, are determined to provide affordable higher education to hardworking students and assist them in launching their careers to greater heights. We will be able to help you only if we can connect timely and have healthy discussions.
12/1/24, 4:36 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, this is something I want to inform you all that the agenda for the discussions, that we are going to have, is to help you all understand the process you will undertake for his university admission journey and what your family will be experiencing with the Edoofa Scholarship Program over the next one and a half years. However, since you are going to be occupied with school and your parents are occupied with work during the day, it seems that the same challenge in connectivity is going to persist for the next couple of months as well.
12/1/24, 4:36 PM - Dev Edoofa: With that being said, what I can do right now to solve this constraint is give you the freedom to choose the time slot for our sessions over the next 10 days [till 20th January].

26/1/24, 9:40 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Nyashadzashe,

I am *Ms. Siddhi Singh, Admission Officer at Edoofa*. Recently I was having a discussion with the Academic Board. They highlighted  that you have not been able to proceed with your admission process in a timely manner, since your child is at school and you have been occupied with work. Hence, I pitched in that I will be able to help you out and take over your application profile so that together we can ensure a timely and smooth progress. Since my operational hours accommodate your timings more suitably, I will be assuming the duties of your admission officer. I am optimistic that together, we can pave the way for an auspicious beginning to your academic journey, resulting in the right career prospects and eventual success for both you and your family.

I was going through your application profile and it is my understanding that you have successfully completed the 2nd step of the admission cycle i.e., Statement of Purpose. May I know if I am correct?
27/1/24, 2:43 PM - +263 78 810 0185: Yes that's accurate.
27/1/24, 3:51 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for confirming that. I understand that you have school during the weekdays and your parents are occupied with work.

Until then, please take care and kindly extend my regards to your family as well!
29/1/24, 11:13 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Nyashadzashe. I hope you are all doing well today. How has your day been going so far?
29/1/24, 11:18 AM - +263 78 397 9366: I am doing well. I hope you are doing good.
29/1/24, 11:40 AM - +263 78 397 9366: I am very sorry ,Nyashadzashe's mobile is switched off due to power challenges since yesterday.
29/1/24, 11:45 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. I am well too, thank you for asking. I understand that you all have been facing network challenges since yesterday. Thank you for letting me know about the same.
29/1/24, 1:51 PM - +263 78 397 9366: Ok thank you very much
29/1/24, 2:10 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Moving forward with our discussion, to confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is B.Sc (Biotechnology) and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2025. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
30/1/24, 8:29 AM - +263 78 810 0185: Good morning how are you doing. Sorry for being absent yesterday my phone was off due to power challenges but today i will be available for our session.
30/1/24, 8:31 AM - +263 78 810 0185: I have selected Msc (Biotechnology) currently i am about to finish my B. Sc ( Applied Biosciences and Biotechnology). And everything is accurate except the entry level it's Masters.
30/1/24, 11:01 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Nyashadzashe. I hope you are doing well today. Kindly excuse me for stating the wrong course and thank you for pointing that out to me. It is quite alright please, I understand that you were facing power challenges due to which we were unable to connect yesterday. However I am glad that we can reconnect today. Before we proceed with our discussion, how has your day been going so far?
30/1/24, 11:09 AM - +263 78 810 0185: I glad to hear from you today. I am doing ok how about you. Thank you for asking
30/1/24, 11:12 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you are doing okay. I am doing fine too, thank you for asking. Moving ahead with today's discussion, based on our experience of over 14 years and having assisted over 5000 students from different countries, we have realized that financial planning is the most important factor when a student plans for their higher education abroad.
30/1/24, 11:12 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am sure that you must be aware that 20-30% of students who are admitted into universities abroad are unable to fulfill their dream and come to India due to a lack of financial planning. The funds needed for booking flights, accommodation, and covering living expenses after arrival often become overwhelming, leading to the decision to defer their admission for a year. This, in turn, creates a gap in the child's education.
30/1/24, 11:12 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: To assist both students and parents in this regard, Edoofa Management has designed a Financial Secure Plan that aims to help you prepare for your higher educational finances without experiencing stress or last-minute rushes. I believe you must be wondering about the details of the same plan and how it helps the parents?
30/1/24, 11:13 AM - +263 78 810 0185: Yes i am curious about it can you explain in detail about this.
30/1/24, 11:14 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Edoofa Secure Plan is important for parents who have children joining the university for tertiary education in the next one to two years for several reasons:
30/1/24, 11:14 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: 1. *Financial Preparedness:* The Edoofa Secure plan helps parents prepare financially for the costs after the Scholarship being offered so that they are not caught off guard.

2. *Reduced Financial Stress:* Having the Edoofa Secure Plan in place can significantly reduce the financial stress on you as parents when your child is about to enter university. Knowing that there is a dedicated fund for education expenses provides peace of mind.
30/1/24, 11:14 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: 3. *Avoiding Debt*: Without proper savings, some parents may resort to taking out loans or accumulating credit card debt to cover their child's education costs. This Educational savings plan helps avoid the burden of debt and high-interest payments.

4. *Compound Interest:* By starting to save early and consistently contributing to the savings plan, parents can take advantage of compound interest, which can significantly increase the amount available for education expenses.
30/1/24, 11:14 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: 5. *Flexibility and Control:* The Edoofa Secure savings plans allow parents to have greater control over their finances and how they allocate funds for their child's education. They can choose investment options that align with their risk tolerance and financial goals.

6. *Encouraging Responsibility*: Involving your child in the process of saving for their education teaches them financial responsibility and the value of higher education. It also motivates them to outperform in Academics.
30/1/24, 11:14 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: 7. *Adapting to Unexpected Changes*: Life is full of surprises, and circumstances can change especially when there are political reforms changing each day impacting the Local Currency. Having an Edoofa Secure Plan allows parents to adapt to unexpected changes in their financial situation while still prioritizing their child's education.

8. *Peace of Mind:* Overall, having the Edoofa Secure plan provides parents with peace of mind, knowing that they are actively planning for their child's future and increasing the likelihood of providing them with a solid education.
30/1/24, 11:14 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, when you go through all the above benefits, I am sure you can see that the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan is an important financial tool for parents/students who are supposed to enter the university soon. 

It helps ensure that the financial aspect of tertiary education is well-managed, reduces stress, and allows parents to provide the best opportunities for their children without resorting to debt or financial hardship. Isn't this something you and your family also wish to have?
30/1/24, 11:18 AM - +263 78 810 0185: Yes i have gone through all the points and it's a great plan which can be helpful if paid attention to and followed.
30/1/24, 11:50 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through the above points, do you want me to help you understand how the Edoofa Secure Plan works?
30/1/24, 11:52 AM - +263 78 810 0185: I fully understood everything and as a family we put measures in place to curb the challenges.
30/1/24, 12:00 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, as you are aware, we are currently in January 2024, and we have a good 20 months to plan for your finances before you start your university education in 2025.
30/1/24, 12:00 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: During the counseling session, you were informed that at Edoofa, we guarantee a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship on the tuition fees. Hence, the cost of education, including food and accommodation after the scholarship, would be between $2000-$3000, and it could be even less. Not more than that.
30/1/24, 12:00 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This means that if you can save $150 per month for the next 20 months, you will be able to save $3000. This amount is more than enough for the first year of university fees, including tuition fees (if any), food, and accommodation. I hope you agree with this?
30/1/24, 12:02 PM - +263 78 810 0185: Oh ok that's really nice and i will work towards that and we can achieve that as a family
30/1/24, 12:04 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Right, this means that by the time you would be in India, you would have already saved the $3000 that will cover the first-year fee.
30/1/24, 12:04 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, in these next 20 months, I am sure you would also be engaged in the EWYL program, and if you secure a minimum of $1000 in 20 months, that means the fees for 1.5 years are already secured.
30/1/24, 12:04 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, for a 3-year course, if we follow the same approach for the remaining 1.5 years, the educational journey for the student and the financial journey for the parent will be easy and smooth. I believe you must be able to see this perspective?
30/1/24, 12:05 PM - +263 78 810 0185: Yes i completely do
30/1/24, 12:06 PM - +263 78 810 0185: Ok coming to EWYL program where are we i remember from last conversation i was supposed to begin by now
30/1/24, 12:11 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. Shortly after today's discussion, we will revisit the commencement of your EWYL journey. Since the previously mentioned date has passed, we will allot a new schedule for you at the end of today's discussion. If you are ready, shall we proceed with our discussion?
30/1/24, 12:12 PM - +263 78 810 0185: Yes let's proceed
30/1/24, 12:13 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. With that said, there is also another benefit, I am sure being in Zimbabwe you know how drastically the exchange rate fluctuates.
30/1/24, 12:13 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: If you are buying a dollar today, you might be spending 7000 bonds, but if you buy a dollar after a month, the rate would be different.
30/1/24, 12:14 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Also, even if you choose to buy dollars every month and save at your home, it is not safe since there is news of robbery, and mugging every day.
30/1/24, 12:14 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: In that case, you will opt to save in the Bank, but again we know that savings in the Bank require a Nostro Account which means you have to pay the bank to keep your money safe, right?
30/1/24, 12:14 PM - +263 78 810 0185: Yes that's all accurate
30/1/24, 12:15 PM - +263 78 810 0185: The exchange rate😭😭😭😭it changes every day without any pattern or trend
30/1/24, 12:56 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Indeed Nyashadzashe. Considering these constraints, Edoofa Management has decided to help the parents and students prepare for the journey way ahead of time by helping them save money with Edoofa without any additional charges but rather saving additional money as well. Do you want me to explain how this has been achieved?
30/1/24, 1:00 PM - +263 78 810 0185: Yes sure
30/1/24, 1:45 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Program Fee (Enrollment Fee) that you were asked to pay is $350. From the $350, you have already paid $200, and the remaining $150 is what you are planning to pay before your due date.
30/1/24, 1:45 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Under the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan, a parent has to deposit a small amount of money which is $150 every month for the next 10 months. 

That means, in 10 months, the money saved will be $1500. When this money is saved, Edoofa will waive off the remaining $150 which was due from the Edoofa Program/Enrollment Fee of $350, thereby making a straight saving of $150 in 10 months.
30/1/24, 1:45 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Imagine you paying $15 every month to the Bank of Zimbabwe to keep your money safe, and here Edoofa is paying you $15 every month to keep your money safe. Now, you must be wondering, why only for 10 months and not for 20 months, right?
30/1/24, 2:05 PM - +263 78 810 0185: I already paid it all and sent proof of payment
30/1/24, 2:05 PM - +263 78 810 0185: Yes
30/1/24, 2:25 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for confirming that. I have taken a note of the same. If you see the bigger picture, you will realize that the reason is quite simple. Upon the completion of the 10 installments, the Edoofa Admissions team will initiate the Child’s Admission Process by applying early to the universities to secure their scholarship and their university seat.
30/1/24, 2:25 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Reserving seats earlier increases the chances of obtaining a maximum scholarship. A higher scholarship means lower fees, and by securing the seat, you will be entitled to pay the fees as per the old fee structure of the university, not the new one implemented in January 2025. Furthermore, when applying to the universities, you will receive an offer letter or a letter of intent detailing the fees, scholarship, and registration fees.
30/1/24, 2:25 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: As explained during the enrollment process, the registration fee is a portion of your first-year university fee, paid to reserve the seat. It ranges from $500-$1000 and is not an additional fee. 

From the $1500 you saved with Edoofa, the registration fee will be paid to the university, securing the seat. For instance, if the registration fee is $1000, Edoofa will pay $1000 from the $1500 saved in 10 months. The updated balance with Edoofa will be $500, which will be paid to the university upon your arrival in India.
30/1/24, 2:25 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This eases the financial burden on the parent, as there is no immediate payment required upon the student's arrival. The $500 saved will cover the remaining fees for the semester/year, as specified in the offer letter from the university. What are your thoughts on this?
30/1/24, 5:59 PM - +263 78 810 0185: It's actually a good thing. So before paying the stated amount of upto $1500 i won't receive offer letters??
30/1/24, 6:24 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I would love to continue with our discussion, however, my operational hours for the day have concluded. Let us reconnect tomorrow at our scheduled time to further discuss the admission process. I wish you a blessed day ahead!
30/1/24, 6:29 PM - +263 78 810 0185: Thank you. Have a wonderful evening.
31/1/24, 10:51 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Nyashadzashe. I hope you are all doing well today. How is your day going so far?
31/1/24, 10:52 AM - +263 78 810 0185: Good morning how are you doing
31/1/24, 10:52 AM - +263 78 810 0185: So far everything is ok. How about you
31/1/24, 10:58 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. I am fine too, thank you for asking. During our previous interaction, you had raised a query regarding the offer letters. I wanted to inform you that the admission process for the 2025 intake will be initiated by the universities from the month of August and we will start sending your application from the same month itself.
31/1/24, 11:00 AM - +263 78 810 0185: Oh ok ok it's crystal clear now. Thank you very much.
31/1/24, 11:03 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. I am glad to see that we are together so far. With this plan for the next 10 months, I am sure you must be wondering what will happen in the next 10 months, considering you have already secured your scholarship seat with the university due to your hard work in the first 10 months. Is my understanding correct?
31/1/24, 11:04 AM - +263 78 810 0185: Yes that's accurate
31/1/24, 11:11 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Let me help you with that as well. In the 11th month, you will be guided to open an FBC Mastercard bank account in Zimbabwe with a deposit of $150. The reason for this is that when you apply for your student Visa, the Embassy asks for a Bank Statement, and this account will serve that purpose.
31/1/24, 11:11 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: We understand it might be expensive if you deposit another $1500 for the remaining 10 months in FB  Bank Zimbabwe, so to avoid the same challenges, we have designed the plan accordingly. You will only be depositing for the 11th, 12th, 13th, and 14th month, which is 4 months.
31/1/24, 11:11 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Once the 4 months are completed, our Department of Student Welfare (DSW) team will assist you with your visa process. The bank statement will act as one of the required documents, and once you receive the visa, you can withdraw the amount from FBC and book the flight ticket. This will help you utilize the money as well. How does it sound?
31/1/24, 11:17 AM - +263 78 810 0185: Oh that's a great plan which made it easier.
31/1/24, 11:18 AM - +263 78 810 0185: This is a great plan indeed and i understood it.
31/1/24, 11:32 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, from the 16th Month till the 20th month, considering it is a 6-month window, you can again continue depositing the money ($150) with Edoofa which can be used in the fee as and when required or you can decide to save this $900 of these 6 months with you as well. This is something which you are free to choose. I hope you have understood the financial secure plan now?
31/1/24, 11:37 AM - +263 78 810 0185: Yes i did
31/1/24, 11:51 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: That's great. Now that you have all the information, I want you to take some time and discuss the financial security plan with your family members. Help them understand its importance and details. Once you're done, we can reconnect, have a discussion, and address any queries you may have. After resolving your concerns, I'll guide you through starting your financial security plan. 

While most students can discuss this with their parents the same day, I understand everyone is different. Could you let me know when you think you'll have the discussion with your parents? This way, we can schedule our next session accordingly.
31/1/24, 11:52 AM - +263 78 810 0185: Ok fine i will update you about this
31/1/24, 12:05 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That's perfectly fine. In that case, we will conclude today's conversation, and I will connect with you tomorrow to resume our discussion. In the meantime, I hope you'll have a detailed discussion with your family and jot down any questions or thoughts you have regarding the Financial Secure plan.
