29/12/23, 4:05 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon dear parents and Ashley

I hope this message finds you well and blessed. It has been a while since the last time we were connected with each other. As I was occupied with university obligations and Christmas preparations, I would like to take this opportunity to inquire how you are doing today?
29/12/23, 4:19 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: As per our last conversation, I was honestly shocked by the news about the tragedy and wanted to have an update on the current situation. Hence, may I know how is your husband and the family?
29/12/23, 4:30 PM - +27 62 594 7168: We are fine he is recovering slowly
29/12/23, 4:34 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. It is a relief on my end as well. I hope you have a speedy recovery.
29/12/23, 4:35 PM - +27 62 594 7168: Thank you very much
29/12/23, 4:36 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: You are most welcome. In the meantime may I know how is Ashley is doing with her school?
29/12/23, 4:37 PM - +27 62 594 7168: He is on holiday
29/12/23, 4:45 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you don't mind asking may I know if you have given any thoughts with the Edoofa Endowment Plan?
29/12/23, 4:59 PM - +27 62 594 7168: Which plans
29/12/23, 5:03 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Please excuse me it was meant to be Edoofa Secure Plan
29/12/23, 5:10 PM - +27 62 594 7168: Tell me about the plan
29/12/23, 6:03 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Edoofa Secure Plan is important for parents who have children joining the university for tertiary education in the next one to two years for several reasons:

*Financial Preparedness:* The Edoofa Secure plan helps parents prepare financially for the costs after the Scholarship being offered so that they are not caught off guard.

*Reduced Financial Stress:* Having the Edoofa Secure Plan in place can significantly reduce the financial stress on you as parents when your child is about to enter university. Knowing that there is a dedicated fund for education expenses provides peace of mind.

*Avoiding Debt*: Without proper savings, some parents may resort to taking out loans or accumulating credit card debt to cover their child's education costs. This Educational savings plan helps avoid the burden of debt and high-interest payments.

*Compound Interest:* By starting to save early and consistently contributing to the savings plan, parents can take advantage of compound interest, which can significantly increase the amount available for education expenses.
29/12/23, 6:04 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Flexibility and Control:* The Edoofa Secure savings plans allow parents to have greater control over their finances and how they allocate funds for their child's education. They can choose investment options that align with their risk tolerance and financial goals.

*Encouraging Responsibility*: Involving your child in the process of saving for their education teaches them financial responsibility and the value of higher education. It also motivates them to outperform in Academics.

*Adapting to Unexpected Changes*: Life is full of surprises, and circumstances can change especially when there are political reforms changing each day impacting the Local Currency. Having an Edoofa Secure Plan allows parents to adapt to unexpected changes in their financial situation while still prioritizing their child's education.
29/12/23, 6:04 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Peace of Mind:* Overall, having the Edoofa Secure plan provides parents with peace of mind, knowing that they are actively planning for their child's future and increasing the likelihood of providing them with a solid education.
29/12/23, 6:04 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, when you go through all the above benefits, I am sure you can see that the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan is an important financial tool for parents/students who are supposed to enter the university soon. 

It helps ensure that the financial aspect of tertiary education is well-managed, reduces stress, and allows parents to provide the best opportunities for their children without resorting to debt or financial hardship. Isn't this something you and your family also wish to have?
29/12/23, 6:11 PM - +27 62 594 7168: You mean that 150 per month for the next 20months
29/12/23, 6:14 PM - +27 62 594 7168: This message was deleted
29/12/23, 6:18 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: That would be correct.

29/12/23, 7:15 PM - +27 62 594 7168: <Media omitted>
29/12/23, 7:18 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am referring the Edoofa secure plan that we have made for securing your child's admission if anything goes wrong in your country by any means.
29/12/23, 8:57 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you so much for taking the time and being online with me today. As my available hours are coming to an end I am closing the session for today and let us connect on the 2nd of January.
