26/1/24, 9:21 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Wilma,

I am *Ms. Siddhi Singh, Admission Officer at Edoofa*. Recently I was having a discussion with the Academic Board. They highlighted  that you have not been able to proceed with your admission process in a timely manner, since your child is at school and you have been occupied with work. Hence, I pitched in that I will be able to help you out and take over your application profile so that together we can ensure a timely and smooth progress. Since my operational hours accommodate your timings more suitably, I will be assuming the duties of your admission officer. I am optimistic that together, we can pave the way for an auspicious beginning to your academic journey, resulting in the right career prospects and eventual success for both you and your family.
26/1/24, 9:21 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
26/1/24, 9:21 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Today, on India's 75th Republic Day, I want to extend warm regards to you and your family!

Let's hold onto the spirit of this auspicious day, embracing the values that make India truly special.
26/1/24, 9:21 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: On this auspicious note, I would like to extend my heartiest regards to you and your family, and I hope that just like my proud nation, we will work unitedly and make progress in your admission process to ensure that you are able to realise your dream of pursuing higher education here in India. I would like to schedule our session for 1:30 PM tomorrow, so that we can discuss the progress and the next steps to be taken for your admission journey.
26/1/24, 9:37 PM - +263 77 451 2698: Good evening and thank you
27/1/24, 1:31 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Wilma. I hope you are having a lovely day. How are you all doing today?
27/1/24, 1:32 PM - +263 77 451 2698: Good afternoon ma'am we are doing well and you
27/1/24, 1:36 PM - +263 77 263 6611: Good afternoon Mem, we good, Wilma has gone back to school as we alluded before that she's in her final year Upper sixth form. Thank you for asking.
27/1/24, 2:20 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to know that you are all well. I am doing fine as well, thank you for asking. Since this is the first time we are interacting, allow me to introduce myself. I am Miss Siddhi Singh, your Admission Officer. I belong from the vibrant city of Varanasi, known as one of the oldest living cities globally, Beyond my passion for education, I find joy in music and playing basketball. It is my pleasure to assist and guide you through the admission process, ensuring you achieve your dream education in India with the support of Edoofa.
27/1/24, 3:35 PM - +263 77 263 6611: Good to hear from you Mem. My name is Mr Moses Bvekwa, from Harare Zimbabwe. I am Wilma's father. May you explain to me the admission process you are referring to because so far Wilma was do EWYL program. Thank you.
27/1/24, 4:23 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for introducing yourself Mr. Moses, it is a pleasure to know you. Rest assured, from Monday onwards we will be walking you through the further steps to be taken in the admission process. I understand that Wilma has school during the weekdays and you are occupied with work. In such a case, I want to ensure that our sessions are held in a timely and smooth manner so we can comfortably proceed with your application process. Could you kindly suggest a 1-hour slot between 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM when we can have our sessions?
27/1/24, 4:54 PM - +263 77 451 2698: Thank you ma'am
I suggest 1pm to 2pm
27/1/24, 5:16 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that. In such a case, we will conclude today's conversation and reconnect on Monday at 1:00 PM to further discuss the application process. Until then, please take care and kindly extend my regards to your family as well.
27/1/24, 7:50 PM - +263 77 451 2698: Thank you ma'am enjoy your weekend
29/1/24, 1:01 PM - +263 77 451 2698: Good afternoon ma'am Siddhi and everyone <This message was edited>
29/1/24, 1:10 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Wilma. I hope you are all doing well. How has your day been going so far?
29/1/24, 1:11 PM - +263 77 451 2698: So far so good and you?
29/1/24, 1:33 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to know that. My day has been going well too, thank you for asking. I was going through Wilma's application profile, and it is my understanding that you have successfully completed the 2nd step of the admission cycle i.e., Statement of Purpose. May I know if I am correct?
29/1/24, 1:34 PM - +263 77 451 2698: Yes Sure you are correct

You may also need to know that she already commenced the Earn While You Learn  program <This message was edited>
29/1/24, 1:53 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for confirming that. Let us move forward with our discussion. To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is BA LLB and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2025. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
29/1/24, 1:53 PM - +263 77 451 2698: It's accurate according to our submissions but we may need to know when is the 1st intake for 2025 <This message was edited>
29/1/24, 2:28 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: The process opens during the month of August every year.
29/1/24, 2:28 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Based on our experience of over 14 years and having assisted over 5000 students from different countries, we have realized that financial planning is the most important factor when a student plans for their higher education abroad.
29/1/24, 2:28 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am sure that you must be aware that 20-30% of students who are admitted into universities abroad are unable to fulfill their dream and come to India due to a lack of financial planning. The funds needed for booking flights, accommodation, and covering living expenses after arrival often become overwhelming, leading to the decision to defer their admission for a year. This, in turn, creates a gap in the child's education.
29/1/24, 2:29 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: To assist both students and parents in this regard, Edoofa Management has designed a Financial Secure Plan that aims to help you prepare for your higher educational finances without experiencing stress or last-minute rushes. I believe you must be wondering about the details of the same plan and how it helps the parents?
29/1/24, 2:31 PM - +263 77 451 2698: Sure ,We were informed about the EWYL which she has already embarked on.

Not knowing if there is another one <This message was edited>
29/1/24, 2:50 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Edoofa Secure Plan is important for parents who have children joining the university for tertiary education in the next one to two years for several reasons:
29/1/24, 2:50 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 1. *Financial Preparedness:* The Edoofa Secure plan helps parents prepare financially for the costs after the Scholarship being offered so that they are not caught off guard.

2. *Reduced Financial Stress:* Having the Edoofa Secure Plan in place can significantly reduce the financial stress on you as parents when your child is about to enter university. Knowing that there is a dedicated fund for education expenses provides peace of mind.
29/1/24, 2:50 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 3. *Avoiding Debt*: Without proper savings, some parents may resort to taking out loans or accumulating credit card debt to cover their child's education costs. This Educational savings plan helps avoid the burden of debt and high-interest payments.

4. *Compound Interest:* By starting to save early and consistently contributing to the savings plan, parents can take advantage of compound interest, which can significantly increase the amount available for education expenses.
29/1/24, 2:50 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 5. *Flexibility and Control:* The Edoofa Secure savings plans allow parents to have greater control over their finances and how they allocate funds for their child's education. They can choose investment options that align with their risk tolerance and financial goals.

6. *Encouraging Responsibility*: Involving your child in the process of saving for their education teaches them financial responsibility and the value of higher education. It also motivates them to outperform in Academics.
29/1/24, 2:50 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 7. *Adapting to Unexpected Changes*: Life is full of surprises, and circumstances can change especially when there are political reforms changing each day impacting the Local Currency. Having an Edoofa Secure Plan allows parents to adapt to unexpected changes in their financial situation while still prioritizing their child's education.

8. *Peace of Mind:* Overall, having the Edoofa Secure plan provides parents with peace of mind, knowing that they are actively planning for their child's future and increasing the likelihood of providing them with a solid education.
29/1/24, 2:50 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, when you go through all the above benefits, I am sure you can see that the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan is an important financial tool for parents/students who are supposed to enter the university soon. 

It helps ensure that the financial aspect of tertiary education is well-managed, reduces stress, and allows parents to provide the best opportunities for their children without resorting to debt or financial hardship. Isn't this something you and your family also wish to have?
29/1/24, 2:52 PM - +263 77 451 2698: Noted maam <This message was edited>
29/1/24, 3:19 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through the above points, do you want me to help you understand how the Edoofa Secure Plan works?
29/1/24, 3:21 PM - +263 77 451 2698: Please go ahead
29/1/24, 3:48 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, as you are aware, we are currently in January 2024, and we have a good 20 months to plan for your finances before you start your university education in 2025.
29/1/24, 3:48 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: During the counseling session, you were informed that at Edoofa, we guarantee a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship on the tuition fees. Hence, the cost of education, including food and accommodation after the scholarship, would be between $2000-$3000, and it could be even less. Not more than that.
29/1/24, 3:48 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This means that if you can save $150 per month for the next 20 months, you will be able to save $3000. This amount is more than enough for the first year of university fees, including tuition fees (if any), food, and accommodation. I hope you agree with this?
29/1/24, 3:53 PM - +263 77 451 2698: Yes absolutely
29/1/24, 4:24 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Right, this means that by the time you would be in India, you would have already saved the $3000 that will cover the first-year fee.
29/1/24, 4:24 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, in these next 20 months, I am sure you would also be engaged in the EWYL program, and if you secure a minimum of $1000 in 20 months, that means the fees for 1.5 years are already secured.
29/1/24, 4:24 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, for a 3-year course, if we follow the same approach for the remaining 1.5 years, the educational journey for the student and the financial journey for the parent will be easy and smooth. I believe you must be able to see this perspective?
29/1/24, 4:36 PM - +263 77 451 2698: True
29/1/24, 5:12 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. With that said, there is also another benefit, I am sure being in Zimbabwe you know how drastically the exchange rate fluctuates.
29/1/24, 5:12 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: If you are buying a dollar today, you might be spending 7000 bonds, but if you buy a dollar after a month, the rate would be different.
29/1/24, 5:12 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Also, even if you choose to buy dollars every month and save at your home, it is not safe since there is news of robbery, and mugging every day.
29/1/24, 5:12 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: In that case, you will opt to save in the Bank, but again we know that savings in the Bank require a Nostro Account which means you have to pay the bank to keep your money safe, right?
29/1/24, 5:20 PM - +263 77 451 2698: Yes but there are also other options
29/1/24, 5:39 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: As much as I would like to continue with our discussion, since my operational hours for the day have already concluded and I have had a long day, I would like to reconnect with you tomorrow at our scheduled time to further discuss the Financial Secure Plan and admission process. Until then, please take care and have a blessed day ahead!
29/1/24, 5:44 PM - +263 77 451 2698: Thank you very much will get in touch tomorrow <This message was edited>
30/1/24, 1:06 PM - +263 77 451 2698: Greetings Ms Siddhi and everyone
30/1/24, 1:29 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Wilma. I hope everything is well on your end. Before we proceed with our discussion today, I would like to check in on you and your family. How are you all doing today?
30/1/24, 1:32 PM - +263 77 263 6611: This message was deleted
30/1/24, 1:33 PM - +263 77 263 6611: We are good thanks for asking, our daughter Wilma is back in school where we alluded last time that they're not allowed any gadgets eg cellphones etc.
30/1/24, 1:58 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you are doing good. I understand please, thank you for letting me know. In her absence, we can continue with our discussion and when Wilma is available she will have the opportunity to go through the details. In such a case, shall we proceed with our discussion for today? <This message was edited>
30/1/24, 1:59 PM - +263 77 451 2698: Yes please we may proceed
30/1/24, 2:18 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: During our previous discussion, we were talking about the details of Financial Secure Plan. Considering these constraints, Edoofa Management has decided to help the parents and students prepare for the journey way ahead of time by helping them save money with Edoofa without any additional charges but rather saving additional money as well. Do you want me to explain how this has been achieved?
30/1/24, 2:19 PM - +263 77 451 2698: Yes Please let's  proceed <This message was edited>
30/1/24, 2:35 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Program Fee (Enrollment Fee) that you were asked to pay is $350. From the $350, you have already paid $200, and the remaining $150 is what you are planning to pay before your due date.
30/1/24, 2:35 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Under the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan, a parent has to deposit a small amount of money which is $150 every month for the next 10 months. 

That means, in 10 months, the money saved will be $1500. When this money is saved, Edoofa will waive off the remaining $150 which was due from the Edoofa Program/Enrollment Fee of $350, thereby making a straight saving of $150 in 10 months.
30/1/24, 2:35 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Imagine you paying $15 every month to the Bank of Zimbabwe to keep your money safe, and here Edoofa is paying you $15 every month to keep your money safe. Now, you must be wondering, why only for 10 months and not for 20 months, right?
30/1/24, 2:36 PM - +263 77 451 2698: No we paid all the $350 in installments of $200 then $150 <This message was edited>
30/1/24, 2:54 PM - +263 77 451 2698: Our understanding is that we completed the   Edoofa enrolment  process and we submitted all the documents required for the statement of purpose That is the stage we are at
30/1/24, 3:00 PM - +263 77 263 6611: Including the transfer charges. It looks like we are starting afresh yet most of the stages we have already passed them. Wilma is on EWYL stage according to my understanding. Maybe you needed a detailed handover take because am failing to follow up now. We deposited the full amount in Mr Charles's Fbc Account. Proof of payment is available if needed. Thank you.
30/1/24, 3:04 PM - +263 77 451 2698: Our last discussion with Ms Ashie was that a Statement of purpose was to be done by Edoofa  and we are waiting for acceptance letters from Universities <This message was edited>
30/1/24, 3:06 PM - +263 77 263 6611: <Media omitted>
30/1/24, 3:06 PM - +263 77 263 6611: <Media omitted>

30/1/24, 3:06 PM - +263 77 263 6611: <Media omitted>
30/1/24, 3:08 PM - +263 77 263 6611: NB. Above are the receipts of all the payments made.
30/1/24, 3:45 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. Thank you for bringing that to my notice. Moving forward, I have taken a note of the same. In reference to your sessions with Ms. Ashi, she was under the impression that your admission intake year is 2024, and during our conversation it was highlighted that your admission intake year is 2025, and hence I took over the duties as your admission officer. For the 2025 intake, the offer letter from the universities will be processed by them post the month of August. In the meanwhile, Edoofa is helping the students in planning their finances by offering the Financial Secure Plan, to ensure that the student does not face any unforeseen challenges or difficulties when they arrive in India for their higher education., which we are discussing currently. I hope we are on the same page regarding this?
30/1/24, 3:53 PM - +263 77 263 6611: Following Mem
30/1/24, 4:00 PM - +263 77 451 2698: Same page thank you <This message was edited>
30/1/24, 4:47 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that ma'am and sir. If you see the bigger picture, you will realize that the reason is quite simple. Upon the completion of the 10 installments, the Edoofa Admissions team will initiate the Child’s Admission Process by applying early to the universities to secure their scholarship and their university seat.
30/1/24, 4:47 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Reserving seats earlier increases the chances of obtaining a maximum scholarship. A higher scholarship means lower fees, and by securing the seat, you will be entitled to pay the fees as per the old fee structure of the university, not the new one implemented in January 2025. Furthermore, when applying to the universities, you will receive an offer letter or a letter of intent detailing the fees, scholarship, and registration fees.
30/1/24, 4:47 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: As explained during the enrollment process, the registration fee is a portion of your first-year university fee, paid to reserve the seat. It ranges from $500-$1000 and is not an additional fee. 

From the $1500 you saved with Edoofa, the registration fee will be paid to the university, securing the seat. For instance, if the registration fee is $1000, Edoofa will pay $1000 from the $1500 saved in 10 months. The updated balance with Edoofa will be $500, which will be paid to the university upon your arrival in India.
30/1/24, 4:47 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This eases the financial burden on the parent, as there is no immediate payment required upon the student's arrival. The $500 saved will cover the remaining fees for the semester/year, as specified in the offer letter from the university. What are your thoughts on this?
30/1/24, 4:50 PM - +263 77 451 2698: Can you please elaborate further here madam <This message was edited>
30/1/24, 4:52 PM - +263 77 451 2698: Are you implying that  the university application process can only start after we pay the  $1500 <This message was edited>
30/1/24, 5:08 PM - +263 77 451 2698: Noted
30/1/24, 6:02 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: The university application process will begin from the month of August, when the universities begin accepting applications for the 2025 intake. The Edoofa Financial Secure Plan helps you to plan your educational journey in advance so that you do not face any difficulties or challenges when it is time to pay for Wilma's registration fees. I hope we are together in this?
30/1/24, 6:02 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I would love to continue with our discussion, however, my operational hours for the day have concluded. Let us reconnect tomorrow at our scheduled time to further discuss the admission process. I wish you a blessed day ahead!
30/1/24, 6:07 PM - +263 77 451 2698: Understood maam
30/1/24, 6:08 PM - +263 77 451 2698: Thank you and same to you until we reconnect tomorrow
31/1/24, 1:22 PM - +263 77 451 2698: Good afternoon ma'am Siddhi and everyone else
31/1/24, 1:23 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Wilma. I hope you are having a wonderful day. How are you all doing today?
31/1/24, 1:23 PM - +263 77 451 2698: Very well ma'am and you
31/1/24, 1:38 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. I am well too, thank you for asking. During our last interaction, we were discussing the Financial Secure Plan. Moving forward in today's discussion, with this plan for the next 10 months, I am sure you must be wondering what will happen in the next 10 months, considering you have already secured your scholarship seat with the university due to your hard work in the first 10 months. Is my understanding correct?
31/1/24, 1:40 PM - +263 77 451 2698: Yes please guide us take us through the process
31/1/24, 1:54 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Let me help you with that as well. In the 11th month, you will be guided to open an FBC Mastercard bank account in Zimbabwe with a deposit of $150. The reason for this is that when you apply for your student Visa, the Embassy asks for a Bank Statement, and this account will serve that purpose.
31/1/24, 1:54 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: We understand it might be expensive if you deposit another $1500 for the remaining 10 months in FB  Bank Zimbabwe, so to avoid the same challenges, we have designed the plan accordingly. You will only be depositing for the 11th, 12th, 13th, and 14th month, which is 4 months.
31/1/24, 1:54 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Once the 4 months are completed, our Department of Student Welfare (DSW) team will assist you with your visa process. The bank statement will act as one of the required documents, and once you receive the visa, you can withdraw the amount from FBC and book the flight ticket. This will help you utilize the money as well. How does it sound?
31/1/24, 1:57 PM - +263 77 451 2698: Thank you sounds great but  if 
We already have a visa account with another bank
Can we use that as an option <This message was edited>
31/1/24, 1:57 PM - +263 77 451 2698: Does the account need to be in Wilma"s name or even the parent"s name is ok
31/1/24, 2:27 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your concern with me. It is alright if you already have an account under the parents' name, however it is advisable that the account be under the students' name to avoid any difficulties  during the VISA process. I hope this helps with your query?
31/1/24, 2:35 PM - +263 77 451 2698: Noted
31/1/24, 2:55 PM - +263 77 263 6611: Wonderful thank you Mem
31/1/24, 2:55 PM - +263 77 263 6611: Noted thank you very much.
31/1/24, 2:56 PM - +263 77 263 6611: That will be taken care of.
31/1/24, 3:26 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now, from the 16th Month till the 20th month, considering it is a 6-month window, you can again continue depositing the money ($150) with Edoofa which can be used in the fee as and when required or you can decide to save this $900 of these 6 months with you as well. This is something which you are free to choose. I hope you have understood the financial secure plan now?
31/1/24, 3:31 PM - +263 77 263 6611: We will come back to you on this issue after we decide as a family on the way forward. Thank you for the update.
31/1/24, 4:28 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now that you have all the information, I want you to take some time and discuss the financial security plan with your family members. Help them understand its importance and details. Once you're done, we can reconnect, have a discussion, and address any queries you may have. After resolving your concerns, I'll guide you through starting your financial security plan. 

While most students can discuss this with their family the same day, I understand everyone is different. Could you let me know when you think you'll have the discussion with your family? This way, we can schedule our next session accordingly.
31/1/24, 4:29 PM - +263 77 451 2698: Let's connect Tomorrow. We will have discussed as a family <This message was edited>
31/1/24, 5:05 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That's perfectly fine. In that case, we will conclude today's conversation, and I will connect with you tomorrow to resume our discussion. In the meantime, I hope you'll have a detailed discussion with your family and jot down any questions or thoughts you have regarding the Financial Secure plan.

Wishing you a good day ahead, and please extend our regards to your family.
31/1/24, 5:08 PM - +263 77 451 2698: Thank you
31/1/24, 6:50 PM - +263 77 263 6611: True, by tomorrow we will have a way forward. Thank you. See you tomorrow then.
1/2/24, 1:03 PM - +263 77 451 2698: Good afternoon Ms Siddhi and everyone
1/2/24, 1:22 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Wilma. I hope you are doing great today. How has your day been going so far?
1/2/24, 1:23 PM - +263 77 451 2698: Very  well thank you
1/2/24, 3:01 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Kindly excuse me for the delay in my response. Our team is currently engaged in the preparation for our next Zimbabwe visit that is going to be this month.

Having said that, before reaching out to you today, I was going through pictures and videos from Edoofa's very first SLICE CON held last week, and that sparked my curiosity about whether you are familiar with what SLICE CON is or not?
1/2/24, 3:02 PM - +263 77 451 2698: It's good to hear that; so are you  part  of the team  visiting Zimbabwe.It would be nice to meet you physically.
No we have not heard of SLICE CON <This message was edited>
1/2/24, 5:34 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Unfortunately, I will not be joining the team who is visiting Zimbabwe, as we will be operating the admission process from back here in India. It is nice to know that you wish to meet me. I am sure that once you arrive in India, we will definitely be able to meet!
1/2/24, 5:34 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is alright, Let me tell you a bit about the same.  Recently, Edoofa hosted a conference called the Symposium of Leaders, Innovators, and Creators at Edoofa, also known as 'SLICE-CON.'
1/2/24, 5:34 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: The conference was attended by all the Edoofians of 2023 and a few senior Edoofians from previous batches. It focused on the art of creation, innovation, and, most importantly, the mindset required to make an impact in one's career.
1/2/24, 5:34 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: During this Industrial Visit and the conference - SLICE CON, Corporate leaders, such as the CEOs and Co-founders from renowned companies like Rage Coffee, Sirona Hygiene, Jolin New York, and more, shared their insights and experiences. These individuals are at the helm of multi-millionaire brands, leading large marketing teams. Their presence added immense value, providing students with the opportunity to engage in transformative conversations.
1/2/24, 5:34 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Let me share a glimpse of the conference with you and your family. I am certain that you too would be this excited to attend such events when he comes to India.

1/2/24, 5:35 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Let me know once you are able to go through the messages about the SLICE CON, along with the images and videos shared with you. This was indeed a momentous step for all of our students, making them employable ready and giving them access to the right opportunities for their careers ahead.
2/2/24, 1:19 PM - +263 77 451 2698: Sure it was
2/2/24, 1:19 PM - +263 77 451 2698: Good afternoon
2/2/24, 1:32 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Wilma.

I hope you are having a lovely day. Certainly. Also, regarding the discussion we had the other day about the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan, I wanted to follow up on our last conversation. Have you, as a family, been able to discuss it? If so, I would like to understand how the discussion went. What were their thoughts about it? Did they have any specific queries or concerns that you would like us to address?
2/2/24, 1:37 PM - +263 77 451 2698: No queries
2/2/24, 1:56 PM - +263 77 451 2698: We just need to know whether this Plan is compulsory
2/2/24, 2:30 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: It is not compulsory for every student. However, the benefits of the plan like the $150 waiver and the flexible payment plan will give you an edge towards successfully planning for Wilma's higher education.

For 2024 intake, once the students receive their offer letter, they are required to pay within 15 days of receiving the offer letter as per the university policy. With the Financial Secure Plan, you have the flexibility of accumulating the same amount within a span of the next months. Don't you agree that it is a great way to ensure that you do not have any last minute financial burden?
2/2/24, 2:31 PM - +263 77 451 2698: Certainly it is
2/2/24, 3:20 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you have the same perspective as well. For the current round of students, there are only 27 seats available for the students who can benefit from the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan. 

Since you have been one of the most dedicated students, and I see you have great aspirations, I wanted you to be a part of the same set of students and start with your future planning the right way.
2/2/24, 3:20 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Also, as this plan commences from the month of February, for the efficient implementation of this plan, we need to decide on a fixed date on which you will deposit $150 every month. This will provide you with the flexibility to align your finances accordingly.
2/2/24, 3:20 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Our complete focus is on providing students and parents with the best ways to avail themselves of these opportunities. We understand that every parent may not be able to make the payment on our specified date. Therefore, considering this situation, we allow them to decide the payment date according to their comfort. In light of the same, may I know the fixed date every month on which you will deposit $150?
2/2/24, 3:23 PM - +263 77 451 2698: By the last date of every month
2/2/24, 3:24 PM - +263 77 451 2698: 10 Months into December start in March Unless if I am wrong
2/2/24, 3:35 PM - +263 77 451 2698: Also if we may now the exact scholarship percentage entitlement guaranteed for  Wilma   for our Financial planning
2/2/24, 4:07 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: The plan begins from the month of February, which means it will conclude by the month of November. May I know if we are together in this?
2/2/24, 4:12 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Since the applications are not out yet and the admission process for the year 2025 has not yet begun, it is not possible for us to give you the exact scholarship percentage that she will be offered. Based on the universities' evaluation of Wilma's application profile, she will be awarded a scholarship accordingly. Rest assured, that it is definitely going to be at least 50%.
2/2/24, 4:22 PM - +263 77 451 2698: Yes we are together so by 29 February and every last day of the month
2/2/24, 4:22 PM - +263 77 451 2698: Noted
2/2/24, 5:04 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Yes, that is indeed correct. I am pleased to hear that we are on the same page here.
2/2/24, 5:04 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing these details, your commitment to securing a seat in this exclusive program is appreciated.

To proceed with the next steps, we will be sharing an official agreement detailing the specifics of the Financial Secure Plan along with its benefits. This agreement is a crucial document that outlines the terms and conditions of your participation in the program. It serves as a legal framework ensuring transparency and mutual understanding between all parties involved.
2/2/24, 5:04 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: As we prepare to send you the agreement, we kindly request the following details to personalize the document:
