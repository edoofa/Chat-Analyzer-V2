16/1/24, 10:55 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Wesley,

I trust this message finds you well, and I hope you are in high spirits. In recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their A-Level results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey.

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?

16/1/24, 11:09 AM - +27 62 114 3321: As for now we are still anxious 😟. We don't have the results because we didn't manage to open the results online.
So Wesley is going to school tomorrow to collect them
16/1/24, 11:10 AM - +27 62 114 3321: We will send the results as soon as we get them.
Thank you

I would like to know if we can continue paying our fees to reduce our load since we will be having a lot to be done in the next few months. e.g visa,ticket and accommodation
