29/12/23, 2:00 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, dear parents and Chiedza!

I hope you are doing well and I find you in the best of Spirits. 

While I was organizing my day for today, I was going through your scholarship application file and noticed that you are supposed to make the payment of $150 for the remaining part of the Edoofa Enrollment fee today. Hence, I thought of sharing a gentle reminder with you and trying to understand how your preparation has been so far? Have you been able to align your preparations in the right direction and make the payment of your fee today? <This message was edited>
29/12/23, 2:11 PM - +263 77 292 8153: Not yet still running around
4/1/24, 9:13 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening!

I hope you are doing a fine evening today. I would like to let you know that I was not able to further connect with you recently as I was occupied with multiple calls with the university. To make up for this let us connect tomorrow at 6:00 PM for further process for our session.
5/1/24, 3:12 AM - +263 77 339 4607: Noted
5/1/24, 6:08 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening!

I hope you are doing well today. How are you doing this lovely evening?
5/1/24, 6:25 PM - +263 77 339 4607: We are fine
5/1/24, 7:03 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Moving forward in our today’s session, we will discuss a bit about your university admission journey. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts. I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them.

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
5/1/24, 7:04 PM - +263 77 339 4607: We can proceed
5/1/24, 7:11 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
5/1/24, 7:20 PM - +263 77 339 4607: Im done
5/1/24, 7:58 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
5/1/24, 7:58 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
5/1/24, 7:59 PM - +263 77 339 4607: Clear
5/1/24, 8:05 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
5/1/24, 8:05 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
5/1/24, 8:44 PM - +263 77 339 4607: Yessd
5/1/24, 8:49 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process, the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
5/1/24, 8:49 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
6/1/24, 6:54 AM - +263 77 339 4607: Good morning at step 5 we were asked to pay $350 and we paid $200 on the 29 th of November and we were supposed to pay $150 by 29 December and failed. But we are working in it so that we pay on the 13th of January this year. If it is possible

This transition marks a significant chapter in my life as I will be bidding farewell to the cherished moments at the Admissions Team in Edoofa.

2/2/24, 2:12 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Chiedza.

I hope you are having a wonderful day. <This message was edited>
2/2/24, 2:15 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. Let me share my views as well so that it will help you expand your understanding.

*Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students:* In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. 

You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent.
2/2/24, 2:15 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s vision for you:* Here our founders talk about the most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of tomorrow.
2/2/24, 2:15 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program:* Talking about the third video, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
2/2/24, 2:15 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP:* Another thing is that Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based. 

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
2/2/24, 2:17 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  I hope you were able to follow through with this?
2/2/24, 3:28 PM - +263 77 339 4607: Yes we can follow
2/2/24, 4:04 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Glad to hear that. Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by tomorrow before our session.
2/2/24, 4:04 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

There are several ways to improve soil fertility, including adding organic matter, such as compost or manure, to the soil; applying fertilizers; and planting cover crops. It is also important to practice good soil management techniques, such as reducing tillage and avoiding overgrazing. By improving soil fertility, farmers can increase crop yields and ensure that their land remains productive for generations to come.
5/2/24, 2:24 PM - +263 71 208 4615: 3.There are many different types of farming systems, but the most common ones are subsistence farming, intensive farming, and commercial farming. Subsistence farming is a small-scale farming system in which farmers grow crops and raise animals primarily to meet the needs of their families. This type of farming is common in developing countries and is often used to produce food for local consumption. Intensive farming, on the other hand, is a large-scale farming system in which farmers use more modern techniques to maximize production. Commercial farming is a type of farming in which farmers grow crops or raise animals for sale in the market .It is usually done for large scale production through use of farm machinery.
5/2/24, 2:24 PM - +263 71 208 4615: 5.ICT, or information and  communication technology, has become increasingly important in agriculture  in these recent years. ICT tools such as the internet, smartphones, and GPS technology are now being used to help farmers improve crop yields, manage their farms more efficiently, and connect with markets and consumers around the world.
GPS technology, for example, is being used to help farmers with tasks such as precision farming, which involves using GPS-guided tractors and other machinery to plant, fertilize, and harvest crops more accurately. Smartphones are being used to provide farmers with access to real-time data on weather, soil conditions, and crop prices.
