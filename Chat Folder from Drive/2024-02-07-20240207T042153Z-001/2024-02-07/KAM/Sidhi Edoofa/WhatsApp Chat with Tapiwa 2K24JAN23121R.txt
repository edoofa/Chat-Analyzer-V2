6/2/24, 12:21 PM - +263 77 540 5274: <Media omitted>
6/2/24, 12:51 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Tapiwa.

I hope that you are all doing wonderful today. Thank you for sharing the updated EWYL form with me Tapiwa. How has your day been going so far?
6/2/24, 12:52 PM - +263 77 540 5274: Afternoon ma'am my day was good
6/2/24, 2:32 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that you day has been going good. Since you were able to go through the image that I shared with you yesterday, allow me to explain the steps to you.
6/2/24, 2:32 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
6/2/24, 2:32 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
6/2/24, 3:20 PM - +263 77 540 5274: Yes they are clear
6/2/24, 4:00 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps - 

*Step 3: Introduction to the Financial Secure Plan* - Parents with children embarking on their university journey within the next one to two years face important decision-making and rigorous financial planning. Edoofa recognizes the significance of this transition and hence has introduced the Edoofa Secure Plan - a unique and systematic strategy to empower parents in financial planning and preparing for their child's tertiary education well in advance.
6/2/24, 4:00 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Scholarship Offer Letter from the university would be issued next year in the month of August.

I hope you are following?
6/2/24, 4:04 PM - +263 77 540 5274: Yes l am following
6/2/24, 4:16 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. The registration fee will be paid through the savings you have accumulated visa the Financial Secure Plan. After the registration fee is paid, for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
6/2/24, 4:16 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
6/2/24, 4:18 PM - +263 77 540 5274: Okay
6/2/24, 4:21 PM - +263 77 540 5274: Does the fee have a deadline for payment
6/2/24, 4:41 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Yes. Most of the universities have a deadline of 15 days after they have issued the offer letter to the students.
6/2/24, 4:41 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now that you have gone through all 6 steps, if we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
6/2/24, 4:42 PM - +263 77 540 5274: Yes ma'am
6/2/24, 4:43 PM - +263 77 540 5274: I have understood
6/2/24, 5:03 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
6/2/24, 5:03 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding. Until you are ready, shall we start with our discussion with me individually? 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
6/2/24, 5:10 PM - +263 77 540 5274: You may share the videos
6/2/24, 5:16 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection. 

Please go through the 4 videos, our next session will be scheduled for tomorrow after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarize your understanding. Hence I would like to know by when do you think you will be able to go through these videos so that we can schedule our next session accordingly?
