I am *Mr. Shivjeet, and I serve as the Admission Officer at Edoofa.* I wanted to extend my heartfelt wishes to you and your family for a prosperous and fulfilling 2024. 

I firmly believe that with the commencement of this new year, comes the promise of fresh beginnings, guiding the way for the actualization of one's deepest dreams and aspirations. As we stand on the threshold of this promising year, I am filled with excitement for the adventures it holds.
6/1/24, 4:05 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: In the same spirit, I would like to share that I am embarking on a journey as I prepare myself to pursue my doctorate and take a step forward in my academic pursuits. This transition marks a significant chapter in my life as I will be bidding farewell to the cherished moments at the Admissions Team in Edoofa.

Over the past year, having the privilege of supporting numerous students, including you, in your pursuit of higher education has been truly rewarding. Witnessing our students thrive and excel in their dream universities and colleges has brought immense satisfaction.
6/1/24, 4:05 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: The decision to transition to a new phase in my life presents an incredible opportunity for me to continue contributing to the lives of students, ensuring their academic journey and overall experience remain enriched and fulfilling.

As I embark on this new journey, I want to assure you that I have entrusted your application file to capable hands. From this point forward, your admission journey will be seamlessly guided by one of our accomplished admission officers, *Ms. Siddhi,* who will connect with you on Tuesday.  I hope you will make yourself available for further procedures and will give your best to your career.
6/1/24, 4:05 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I extend my heartfelt wishes for your continued success and a bright future filled with educational accomplishments. Wish you all the best, and God Bless.

Edoofa Admission Team.
8/1/24, 2:24 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Ammy,

I am *Ms. Siddhi Singh, Admission Officer at Edoofa* and I am honoured to assume the responsibilities previously held by Mr. Shivjeet. I will be guiding you toward realising your dream education with Edoofa. I am confident that together, we can ensure a promising start to your educational journey, leading to the right employment opportunities and ultimately, success for you and your family.
8/1/24, 2:24 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: In the past few days, I had an in-depth discussion with Mr. Shivjeet and had the opportunity to review your scholarship application file in our records. Through this process, I gained valuable insights into your dreams and aspirations to advance your academic career. Upon reviewing your application file, I was both impressed and reassured to assist you in achieving these goals here in India, which will unlock doors to incredible opportunities in the future.
8/1/24, 2:24 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Before we get into the specifics of your admission journey and talk about your admission process, I would like to share an exciting milestone that India as a country achieved within the first week of 2024 – the successful *India's Chandrayaan-3 Engine Test.* This accomplishment is responsible for the third lunar mission, aiming to land a rover on the Moon's south polar region and conduct scientific studies that could check Moon's viability to sustain life. It signifies a significant scientific advancement, laying the groundwork for future progress.
8/1/24, 2:24 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This achievement has not only pushed boundaries but also has inspired young minds all over the world to pursue their dreams. On the same note, I wanted to extend my heartiest wishes for the New Year to you and your family and check in to see how you and your family started your year?
8/1/24, 2:28 PM - +263 71 941 0618: Greetings

We are all good how are you 
Heartiest wishes of the new year to you too Ms Siddhi Singh
8/1/24, 3:06 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, Ammy. Thank you for your kind wishes.
8/1/24, 3:08 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: A new year brings forth a multitude of possibilities and fresh opportunities for growth and self-discovery. Though the new year itself may not bring immediate transformation, it marks a symbolic turning point, a chance to reflect and set new goals for ourselves. This year, I have decided to practice more compassion, learn at least one new skill, and assist students who were unable to proceed further with their admission process in 2023, guiding them to build their envisioned future.

May I ask what changes or additions you have decided to make in the year 2024?
8/1/24, 3:10 PM - +263 71 941 0618: Not much changes this year just hoping for a adventurous year filled with learning
8/1/24, 3:13 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Absolutely, with learning comes transformative changes that offer the opportunity for personal growth and success, I am looking forward for you to explore all the adventures that lie ahead of you.
8/1/24, 3:14 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, I would like to shift focus to your admission process. As per your application file, it seems that you were unable to proceed with your admission formalities scheduled for August 2024. Since a few months have passed, and this is our first interaction, I would like to inquire why you were unable to do so and if now is the right time for you to focus on your university admission journey for higher education abroad.
8/1/24, 4:11 PM - +263 77 240 6169: We greatly appreciate your contribution and wish you the best in your new endeavor.
8/1/24, 4:24 PM - +263 77 240 6169: New Year's greetings and heartfelt wishes for the new year to you and your family. We welcome you to the new challenges and hope to journey together through the process.
8/1/24, 4:30 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I appreciate your New Year's greetings and heartfelt wishes; I am grateful for your warm sentiments and look forward to navigating through the new challenges together.

May I know if you were able to go through my previous messages?
8/1/24, 4:39 PM - +263 71 941 0618: I was still busy with my exams
8/1/24, 5:01 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Alright, Ammy. I completely understand. Performing well in exams is indeed crucial, and I'm glad to know that you were focused on it.

May I know if now is the right time for you to progress further in the application process and assist you in securing a scholarship seat with the best university for your education?
8/1/24, 5:01 PM - +263 71 941 0618: Yes it is
8/1/24, 5:03 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: It is great to know that you are now available to take your admission process forward.

9/1/24, 9:35 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that. Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
9/1/24, 9:41 AM - +263 71 941 0618: I would like to know about the next step
9/1/24, 10:11 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Alright, dear. There is just one step that needs to be completed before we can start sending out your application to the universities. Could you please share your *ID Proof* with me?
9/1/24, 10:11 AM - +263 71 941 0618: Okay I will send it as soon as I get home
9/1/24, 10:13 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: May I know when you will be able to do that?
9/1/24, 10:19 AM - +263 71 941 0618: At 5 currently at work
9/1/24, 10:43 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Alright, dear. Do you wish to reconnect with me at 5:00 PM?

9/1/24, 11:16 AM - +263 71 941 0618: Have a good day
9/1/24, 1:30 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Hello Ammy, due to some urgent work-related matters, I will be unavailable until 3:30 PM. Is it okay with you if we can reschedule our conversation for then?
9/1/24, 1:33 PM - +263 71 941 0618: It's oky
9/1/24, 2:49 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good afternoon, dear. How is your day going?
9/1/24, 2:49 PM - +263 71 941 0618: My day is going great yours?

9/1/24, 2:51 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Alright, I apologize for the confusion dear. I will reconnect with you at 5:00 PM.
9/1/24, 3:41 PM - +263 71 941 0618: Noted with thanks
9/1/24, 5:15 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good evening, Ammy. May I ask if you are available to continue our discussion now?
9/1/24, 5:28 PM - +263 71 941 0618: <Media omitted>
9/1/24, 5:34 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your ID proof with me. Are you excited to initiate the process? Currently, 69 students have already secured their seats, leaving 31 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that Abigail is among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
9/1/24, 5:36 PM - +263 71 941 0618: Yes I am
9/1/24, 5:38 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to evaluate your application after which if they accept your application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
9/1/24, 5:41 PM - +263 71 941 0618: Thank you enjoy the rest of your day
16/1/24, 7:11 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Evening, Parents and Ammy,

I hope this message finds you in good health and high spirits. It is a pleasure to reconnect with you today, and I am excited to share an important update with you.

Since our last discussion, the admissions team has been working diligently to process your scholarship application for universities in India under the Endowment plan. I am pleased to inform you that your application has been accepted by one of the leading universities, Lovely Professional University in India, and they have decided to offer you a scholarship.
16/1/24, 7:11 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
16/1/24, 7:11 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: The university will be mailing you the official offer letter shortly. However, since we received it in advance, we wanted to share this wonderful news with you and provide a head start on our discussions. I kindly request you to take your time to thoroughly review the letter. We will have a detailed discussion about its contents tomorrow at 12:30 PM.

In the meantime, I recommend that you make note of any questions or concerns that may arise as you review the letter. By setting a specific time, we can ensure that one of your family representatives will be available to connect with us.
16/1/24, 7:11 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This discussion will be an opportunity for me to assist you in gaining a better understanding of the remaining contents of your offer letter, addressing any queries you may have, and providing guidance on the requirements for the rest of your admission journey.

To schedule our discussion, please confirm your availability for the proposed time. If this time is not convenient for you, please share your availability within the window from 12:30 PM to 4:00 PM, and we will arrange a suitable connection time accordingly.

Congratulations to you and your family! ⭐
16/1/24, 7:17 PM - +263 71 941 0618: Wow that is amazing news . Thank you so much
16/1/24, 7:17 PM - +263 71 941 0618: Thank you
17/1/24, 12:51 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Ammy,

In light of the offer letter you received, I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to you and your family on this remarkable achievement in your academic journey.

Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion for you and your family, and I can only imagine the excitement that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.
17/1/24, 12:51 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now that you have the letter in your possession, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you've had the chance to go through the offer letter thoroughly. 

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university
17/1/24, 1:00 PM - +263 71 941 0618: Greetings
17/1/24, 1:00 PM - +263 71 941 0618: Thank you so much
17/1/24, 1:00 PM - +263 71 941 0618: I did go through the letter
17/1/24, 1:03 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As we proceed with today's discussion, we will get into the details of this specific offer letter. I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.
17/1/24, 1:03 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
17/1/24, 1:06 PM - +263 71 941 0618: Yes we look forward to the discussion
17/1/24, 1:31 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Amazing. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from LPU University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
17/1/24, 1:31 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion -

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission Processing Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4. What’s the Registration fee?
17/1/24, 1:34 PM - +263 71 941 0618: 1.$1225
2.4 years 
3.$200
4.$700
17/1/24, 2:07 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Yes, that is correct. As you can see in your offer letter, your course is a 4-year-long course, and each year is divided into 2 semesters, this means that you will have 8 semesters in your degree.*

After the scholarship, your per semester tuition fee is $1225 making your per annum tuition fee ($1225*2) = $2450. Is that clear?
17/1/24, 2:14 PM - +263 71 941 0618: Yes very clear
17/1/24, 2:30 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, Let me also brief you on the two categories of accommodation that are available at LPU -

*1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels inside LPU have different categories. Standard Room with Air Cooler and Standard Room with Air Conditioner with a different number of seaters, the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want.

The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a standard four-seater air cooler room is $1125 and the per annum standard mess/food service fee is $550 and this increases with the type of room/meal plan you choose.
17/1/24, 2:30 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

We also have many students in India who have opted for accommodation outside the LPU campus considering it is more affordable, the cost will be around $1000 per annum and that includes Rent, Food, Wifi Service, and other basic amenities such as water and electricity bills.

The outside accommodations are safe. Students have an option to cook for themselves, along with that they find a community of Edoofians from Africa who are already studying at the same university as them.
17/1/24, 2:31 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: If you decide to stay on campus, the university officials will help you settle and will be taking responsibility for your well-being, our per annum accommodation cost will be $1675.

However, if a student doesn’t wish to stay on campus and is looking for more affordable accommodation options, in that case, they can go with the off-campus accommodation where their per annum cost would be around $1000 including the food cost and they can also cook food for themselves.
17/1/24, 2:31 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: For the off-campus accommodation, you can connect with any of the Edoofians staying off-campus, and he/she would help you look for the off-campus accommodation options. If you are not connected with any students, we will help you connect with them near your time of arrival so that they can help you with the off-campus accommodation options.

LPU never forces anyone to choose the Hostel, they ask them to visit the campus, check for themselves, and then decide whether he/she wants to stay inside or outside the campus. Are you clear on this?
17/1/24, 2:36 PM - +263 71 941 0618: Yes we are clear
17/1/24, 2:47 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: You also have the examination fee of $75 which is due every semester, and the health insurance fee. A Medical Health Insurance policy is mandatory for all international students and they can get it from the university itself and it would cost them $50 per annum subject to yearly revision.
17/1/24, 2:48 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: If God forbids and something happens to you during your higher education, you would be protected from the financial risks or uncertainties that arise due to a medical emergency. I hope you are clear about this?
17/1/24, 2:56 PM - +263 71 941 0618: Yes we are
17/1/24, 3:18 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $700 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on  January 30th, 2024*. I hope we are together so far?
17/1/24, 4:13 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: @263719410618 may I know if you were able to go through my previous message, dear?
17/1/24, 4:18 PM - +263 71 941 0618: Yes we are
17/1/24, 4:19 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $100 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
17/1/24, 4:20 PM - +263 71 941 0618: Yes
17/1/24, 4:21 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $100 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $600 of the registration fee. This $600 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:
1. An initial payment of *$300 before the first deadline date of January 30th, 2024* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).
2. A subsequent payment of *$300 before the second deadline date of February 29th, 2024* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
17/1/24, 4:21 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $600 within 15 working days, before January 30th, 2024. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
17/1/24, 5:23 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: @263719410618 may I know if you were able to go through my previous messages?
17/1/24, 6:08 PM - +263 71 941 0618: Yes it's clear
18/1/24, 2:16 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Ammy. How are you all doing today?
18/1/24, 2:21 PM - +263 71 941 0618: Good afternoon
18/1/24, 2:21 PM - +263 71 941 0618: I am good and you
18/1/24, 2:31 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to know that you are doing good. I am doing well myself, thank you for asking dear.
18/1/24, 2:31 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: May I know if you were able to go through the details that I shared with you in our previous conversation?
18/1/24, 4:11 PM - +263 71 941 0618: Yes I was
18/1/24, 4:29 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Very well, dear. Are you available right now to continue with our session?
22/1/24, 3:02 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Ammy,

I hope this message finds you well. With regards to our discussion last week, I was expecting a response from your end to have further conversation about the offer letter you have received from the university and guide you through the admission next steps in your journey with Edoofa.

However, it appears that my messages might not have gotten through, and since it has been a few days, I wanted to reach out and check if we are still connected. Have you had the opportunity to review my previous messages?
22/1/24, 3:18 PM - +263 71 941 0618: This is The last message I got from your side
22/1/24, 3:21 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Yes Ammy. I am glad that we are reconnected now. However I did not get a response from your end since Thursday, so I wanted to cross-check whether you were able to go through my messages and are currently available to complete our discussion regarding your Offer Letter from LPU.
22/1/24, 3:37 PM - +263 71 941 0618: I am available
22/1/24, 3:56 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Alright, please. Now, let us come to the payment mode for your university registration fee due -

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
22/1/24, 3:56 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
22/1/24, 4:08 PM - +263 71 941 0618: No Bulawayo
22/1/24, 4:09 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Alright please, If you are planning to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash. <This message was edited>
22/1/24, 4:09 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
22/1/24, 4:09 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
22/1/24, 4:22 PM - +263 71 941 0618: Noted
22/1/24, 4:25 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: You are most welcome. Alternatively, I was also going through your application file and noticed that you made a deposit of your enrollment fee through Mr. Charles's FBC Bank Account.
22/1/24, 4:25 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: If you want to use the same mode of payment for your university registration fee, you can do that as well since it would be feasible and the International Transfer Charges are 12.5% of the amount you want to send. I will share the account details with you once again for your reference-

22/1/24, 4:45 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now that you know your per annum educational expenses for your education abroad, let me also help you understand how you can make your education more affordable.

Ideally, the complete per annum fee is to be paid by the student, however, for students under the Edoofa Program, they have an additional opportunity of the EWYL Program. Because of that, you as a student can earn $800 to $1200 worth of scholarship credits in a year and use them to pay a part of your fee.
22/1/24, 4:45 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I would also like to inform you that the above range shared does not mean that a student can earn credits only up to $1200. There is no upper limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits.

In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his or her higher education, they can earn accordingly. Are you clear on this? <This message was edited>

23/1/24, 8:50 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Ammy. I apologize fornot being able to reconnect yesterday as my operational hours had concluded. However, I am glad that we can reconnect today to complete our discussion regarding your offer letter. Let me also share a few insights into the university with you -
23/1/24, 8:50 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: LPU is one of the best universities in India and it has been ranked in the top 80 universities worldwide, because of its international tie-ups, the exposure a student gets at the university is indomitable. 

It has a campus of 800 acres, with over 100,000 students studying from all over the world. Students from LPU are placed at Microsoft, Google, IMF, Work Bank, and many more. It has spent a lot of money building the infrastructure so that a quality service can be given to the students.
23/1/24, 8:50 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: The students at LPU are not only looking for Academics but holistic development is given the utmost importance. The students there can join clubs to represent the University in various competitions like MUN, Debate, and Sports along with various other activities.

As you can not visit the campus and see it for yourself, in that case, you can take a virtual tour of the campus, it is open 24/7 and is never off. Here is the link for the same - https://www.lpu.in/virtual-tour/

24/1/24, 1:01 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Ammy!

I hope you are doing well and I find you in high spirits. After our previous discussion, I am sure you and your family were filled with anticipation regarding the opportunity presented by Lovely Professional University. 

Receiving the university's offer letter is indeed a significant milestone, and I can imagine the excitement that must have accompanied the anticipation of this moment.

Looking forward, I would like to enquire if you and your family had an opportunity to review and discuss the offer letter from Lovely Professional University as a collective?
24/1/24, 1:28 PM - +263 71 941 0618: They are very delighted
24/1/24, 1:30 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: It's wonderful to hear that they are delighted and that you've had a family discussion about the offer letter, and I am confident that you must all be delighted to witness the positive strides being made toward realizing your higher education goals in India.

As you move forward, I am curious to know how your family conversation went. What are your thoughts and feelings regarding the discussion?

30/1/24, 11:58 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: This message was deleted
30/1/24, 11:59 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. I am doing fine too, thank you for asking. Moving forward, I would like to discuss your plans for securing your scholarship seat so that we can communicate them with the university. 

As the university has set a deadline of 30th January 2024, for completing the registration process, you have two options to choose from. You can either make an initial payment of $300, or you can opt to pay the full $600 in one installment to expedite your admission process. Have you had an opportunity to consider which payment plan would be most suitable for you?
2/2/24, 6:26 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Ammy.

I hope you are all well. I am reaching out to you out of concern regarding your offer letter. Your deadline was on 30 January, and we haven't been able to connect in the past few days. I was hoping to get a response from your end, however due to some reason we were not able to do so. May I know if everything is well on your end?
3/2/24, 2:57 PM - +263 77 240 6169: Good day we fail to meet the deadline due to delayed release of funds from our financiers, we will advise as soon as we recieve the funds. Our opologies for the inconvenience caused.

I hope you are all doing wonderful today. I understand that your funds did not get released on time which is causing a delay in the payment of the registration amount. Thank you for letting me know that. I would appreciate it if you could provide some insight into the reasons due to which we were unable to connect prior to the deadline date to address your concern, it would greatly assist us in understanding the situation better.
