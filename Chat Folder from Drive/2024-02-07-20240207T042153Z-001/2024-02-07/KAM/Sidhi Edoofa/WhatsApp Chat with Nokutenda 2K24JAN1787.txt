While you are sharing the forms with me, let us proceed with our discussion in the meanwhile. Moving forward in today's session, we will discuss a bit about your university admission journey.

I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them.

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
24/1/24, 10:46 AM - +263 71 417 0314: I am ready
24/1/24, 10:48 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
24/1/24, 10:48 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Alright please, I would encourage you to go through the above image representing your university admission process and once you are done, let me know so that I can explain the same to you in detail.
24/1/24, 10:49 AM - +263 77 398 2551: Am done
24/1/24, 10:51 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
24/1/24, 10:51 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
24/1/24, 11:12 AM - +263 77 398 2551: Very clear to me
24/1/24, 11:13 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counselling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counselling session will take about 1 hour.
24/1/24, 11:13 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
24/1/24, 11:15 AM - +263 77 398 2551: Am following
24/1/24, 11:16 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process, the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
24/1/24, 11:16 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
24/1/24, 11:16 AM - +263 71 417 0314: Following
24/1/24, 11:16 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through all 6 steps, please feel free to share your thoughts and queries if you have any.

24/1/24, 11:23 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I notice that you have written $2000 - $3000 in question 4C. I would like to clarify with you that the amount mentioned in the question refers to the amount you were asked to pay as enrollment fee for the Edoofa scholarship program.

24/1/24, 1:56 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
24/1/24, 1:56 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding during tomorrow’s session. You may take today’s time for the same. Until you are ready, shall we start with our discussion with me individually?
24/1/24, 1:56 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
24/1/24, 1:57 PM - +263 71 417 0314: Following

25/1/24, 2:56 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the corrected forms with me Nokutenda. May I know if you were able to go through the videos in detail? If yes, could you kindly share your understanding of each video individually?

25/1/24, 3:32 PM - +263 71 417 0314: So in the first video I was able to understand that for one to be identified as an Edoofian they have to be confident and prove themselves to be eligible for the scholarship and also smile
25/1/24, 3:57 PM - +263 71 417 0314: I am not able to understand the other ones
25/1/24, 3:58 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: May I know what is the difficulty that you are facing in understanding the videos dear?
25/1/24, 3:59 PM - +263 71 417 0314: I can't hear them properly
25/1/24, 4:05 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. Can you try listening to the videos from another device?

The reason I am emphasising on you watching the videos is because the founders of Edoofa created them to share their wisdom from over 15 years in education. These videos hold valuable insights for your journey ahead and will help you grasp Edoofa's vision and how you can shine as a student. It's like a guide for you!
25/1/24, 4:15 PM - +263 71 417 0314: Yes ma'am I understand
25/1/24, 5:38 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Very well. In such a case, kindly take another day's time to go through the videos. Since my operational hours for the day have already concluded and it's been a long day already, I would like to schedule our session for 1:00 PM tomorrow, if that is suitable for you. In case you wish to have the session at another time, kindly mention the same here on the group and we will reschedule accordingly. I hope that by tomorrow you will have time go through the videos from another device. If you face issues in going through the videos, kindly let me know, so that we can come up with a solution for the same. Until then, please take care and have a blessed night!
