30/12/23, 6:53 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Wishing you all a Happy New Year. May it be filled with love, laughter, and endless possibilities.
26/1/24, 9:20 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Chiedza,

I am *Ms. Siddhi Singh, Admission Officer at Edoofa*. Recently I was having a discussion with the Academic Board. They highlighted  that you have not been able to proceed with your admission process in a timely manner, since your child is at school and you have been occupied with work. Hence, I pitched in that I will be able to help you out and take over your application profile so that together we can ensure a timely and smooth progress. Since my operational hours accommodate your timings more suitably, I will be assuming the duties of your admission officer. I am optimistic that together, we can pave the way for an auspicious beginning to your academic journey, resulting in the right career prospects and eventual success for both you and your family.
26/1/24, 9:20 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
26/1/24, 9:20 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Today, on India's 75th Republic Day, I want to extend warm regards to you and your family! As we mark 75 years of freedom and democracy, my heart overflows with pride for our vibrant nation. Today, we celebrate the sacrifices of our forefathers, the strength of our unity, and the promise of a brighter tomorrow. Let's hold onto the spirit of this auspicious day, embracing the values that make India truly special.
26/1/24, 9:20 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: On this auspicious note, I would like to extend my heartiest regards to you and your family, and I hope that just like my proud nation, we will work unitedly and make progress in your admission process to ensure that you are able to realise your dream of pursuing higher education here in India. I would like to schedule our session for 1:30 PM tomorrow, so that we can discuss the progress and the next steps to be taken for your admission journey.
26/1/24, 10:13 PM - +263 77 277 0177: Noted.  Chibuwe high school has recently introduced a no cellphone policy and hence my kid is blocked from the whole Internet access. Liase with the school head to give Edoofa students access to Internet
27/1/24, 1:29 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Chiedza. Thank you for letting me know about Chiedza's situation. I hope you are having a lovely day. How are you all doing today?

I belong from the vibrant city of Varanasi, known as one of the oldest living cities globally, Beyond my passion for education, I find joy in music and playing basketball. It is my pleasure to assist and guide you through the admission process, ensuring you achieve your dream education in India with the support of Edoofa.
27/1/24, 5:41 PM - +263 78 779 0133: Okay...thank you
27/1/24, 5:41 PM - +263 78 779 0133: My apologies..our network is low
27/1/24, 5:49 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand that you have school during the weekdays and your parents are occupied with work. In such a case, I want to ensure that our sessions are held in a timely and smooth manner so we can comfortably proceed with your application process. Could you kindly suggest a 1-hour slot between 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM when we can have our sessions?
27/1/24, 5:51 PM - +263 78 779 0133: During these weekdays??
27/1/24, 5:52 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Yes, that is correct. During the weekdays and Saturday.

29/1/24, 4:12 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Chiedza. I hope you are all doing well today. How has your day been going so far?
29/1/24, 4:22 PM - +263 77 277 0177: We are all fine. Joyce will join in soon. She is finishing a lesson at school
29/1/24, 4:29 PM - +263 78 779 0133: I am done n ready....Good Afternoon
29/1/24, 5:09 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you are all doing fine. I was going through Chiedza's application profile and it is my understanding that you have successfully completed the 2nd step of the admission cycle i.e., Statement of Purpose. May I know if I am correct?
29/1/24, 5:37 PM - +263 78 779 0133: Yes I have
29/1/24, 5:50 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for confirming that. As much as I would like to continue with our discussion, since my operational hours for the day have already concluded, I would like to reconnect with you tomorrow at our scheduled time to further discuss the Financial Secure Plan and admission process. Until then, please take care and have a blessed day ahead!
29/1/24, 5:51 PM - +263 78 779 0133: Oolk...thank you
30/1/24, 4:14 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Chiedza.

I hope everything is well on your end. Before we proceed with our discussion, I would like to check in on you and your family. How are you all doing today?
30/1/24, 4:38 PM - +263 78 779 0133: Afternoon...we are all doing well thank you
30/1/24, 5:30 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you are all well. I am doing fine too, thank you for asking. Let us move forward with our discussion. To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is BA LLB and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2025. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
30/1/24, 5:34 PM - +263 77 277 0177: On her behalf, l confirm that info is correct
30/1/24, 5:35 PM - +263 77 277 0177: Joice joining in soon
30/1/24, 6:17 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I would love to continue with our discussion, however, my operational hours for the day have concluded. Let us reconnect tomorrow at our scheduled time to further discuss the Financial Secure Plan. I wish you a blessed day ahead!
31/1/24, 4:21 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Chiedza. I hope you are having a wonderful day. How are you all doing today?
31/1/24, 4:27 PM - +263 78 779 0133: Yes good afternoon....we are doing well
31/1/24, 4:32 PM - +263 77 277 0177: We are all fine. Hope you are well that side.  Joice joining in soon. Thank you.
31/1/24, 4:32 PM - +263 78 779 0133: Am now in
31/1/24, 5:12 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that you are all doing well. I am doing great, thanks for asking. In our previous conversation, you had confirmed your chosen course and your year of intake. Thank you for your confirmation. Based on our experience of over 14 years and having assisted over 5000 students from different countries, we have realized that financial planning is the most important factor when a student plans for their higher education abroad.
31/1/24, 5:12 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am sure that you must be aware that 20-30% of students who are admitted into universities abroad are unable to fulfill their dream and come to India due to a lack of financial planning. The funds needed for booking flights, accommodation, and covering living expenses after arrival often become overwhelming, leading to the decision to defer their admission for a year. This, in turn, creates a gap in the child's education.
31/1/24, 5:12 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: To assist both students and parents in this regard, Edoofa Management has designed a Financial Secure Plan that aims to help you prepare for your higher educational finances without experiencing stress or last-minute rushes. I believe you must be wondering about the details of the same plan and how it helps the parents?
31/1/24, 5:33 PM - +263 78 779 0133: Yes
31/1/24, 6:48 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Edoofa Secure Plan is important for parents who have children joining the university for tertiary education in the next one to two years for several reasons:
31/1/24, 6:48 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 1. *Financial Preparedness:* The Edoofa Secure plan helps parents prepare financially for the costs after the Scholarship being offered so that they are not caught off guard.

2. *Reduced Financial Stress:* Having the Edoofa Secure Plan in place can significantly reduce the financial stress on you as parents when your child is about to enter university. Knowing that there is a dedicated fund for education expenses provides peace of mind.
31/1/24, 6:48 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 3. *Avoiding Debt*: Without proper savings, some parents may resort to taking out loans or accumulating credit card debt to cover their child's education costs. This Educational savings plan helps avoid the burden of debt and high-interest payments.

4. *Compound Interest:* By starting to save early and consistently contributing to the savings plan, parents can take advantage of compound interest, which can significantly increase the amount available for education expenses.
31/1/24, 6:48 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 5. *Flexibility and Control:* The Edoofa Secure savings plans allow parents to have greater control over their finances and how they allocate funds for their child's education. They can choose investment options that align with their risk tolerance and financial goals.

6. *Encouraging Responsibility*: Involving your child in the process of saving for their education teaches them financial responsibility and the value of higher education. It also motivates them to outperform in Academics.
31/1/24, 6:48 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 7. *Adapting to Unexpected Changes*: Life is full of surprises, and circumstances can change especially when there are political reforms changing each day impacting the Local Currency. Having an Edoofa Secure Plan allows parents to adapt to unexpected changes in their financial situation while still prioritizing their child's education.

8. *Peace of Mind:* Overall, having the Edoofa Secure plan provides parents with peace of mind, knowing that they are actively planning for their child's future and increasing the likelihood of providing them with a solid education.
31/1/24, 6:48 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, when you go through all the above benefits, I am sure you can see that the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan is an important financial tool for parents/students who are supposed to enter the university soon. 

It helps ensure that the financial aspect of tertiary education is well-managed, reduces stress, and allows parents to provide the best opportunities for their children without resorting to debt or financial hardship. Isn't this something you and your family also wish to have?
31/1/24, 6:52 PM - +263 78 779 0133: Yes it is..
31/1/24, 7:17 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Allow me to help you understand how the plan works. As you are aware, we are currently in January 2024, and we have a good 20 months to plan for your finances before you start your university education in 2025.
31/1/24, 7:17 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: During the counseling session, you were informed that at Edoofa, we guarantee a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship on the tuition fees. Hence, the cost of education, including food and accommodation after the scholarship, would be between $2000-$3000, and it could be even less. Not more than that.
31/1/24, 7:17 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This means that if you can save $150 per month for the next 20 months, you will be able to save $3000. This amount is more than enough for the first year of university fees, including tuition fees (if any), food, and accommodation. I hope you agree with this?
31/1/24, 9:44 PM - +263 78 779 0133: Yes I do
1/2/24, 10:39 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Chiedza. I hope you are all doing wonderful today!

Kindly excuse me for being unable to respond to your message last night, as our operational hours had already concluded. I am glad that you agree with it. Right, this means that by the time you would be in India, you would have already saved the $3000 that will cover the first-year fee.
1/2/24, 10:39 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, in these next 20 months, I am sure you would also be engaged in the EWYL program, and if you secure a minimum of $1000 in 20 months, that means the fees for 1.5 years are already secured.
1/2/24, 10:39 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, for a 3-year course, if we follow the same approach for the remaining 1.5 years, the educational journey for the student and the financial journey for the parent will be easy and smooth. I believe you must be able to see this perspective?
1/2/24, 12:21 PM - +263 78 779 0133: Yes I do
1/2/24, 2:13 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. With that said, there is also another benefit, I am sure being in Zimbabwe you know how drastically the exchange rate fluctuates.
1/2/24, 2:13 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: If you are buying a dollar today, you might be spending 7000 bonds, but if you buy a dollar after a month, the rate would be different.
1/2/24, 2:13 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Also, even if you choose to buy dollars every month and save at your home, it is not safe since there is news of robbery, and mugging every day.
1/2/24, 2:13 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: In that case, you will opt to save in the Bank, but again we know that savings in the Bank require a Nostro Account which means you have to pay the bank to keep your money safe, right?
1/2/24, 4:32 PM - +263 78 779 0133: Yeah
1/2/24, 4:56 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is great to hear, considering these constraints, Edoofa Management has decided to help the parents and students prepare for the journey way ahead of time by helping them save money with Edoofa without any additional charges but rather saving additional money as well. Do you want me to explain how this has been achieved?
1/2/24, 4:57 PM - +263 78 779 0133: Yes ...please do
2/2/24, 4:52 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Chiedza.

I hope you are having a wonderful day. Kindly excuse me for not being able to respond to your message last night as our team is currently working tirelessly towards the preparation of our upcoming Zimbabwe trip in the month of February. Before we proceed with our discussion, I would like to ask how are you doing today?
2/2/24, 5:00 PM - +263 77 277 0177: This is brilliant idea.  Can we have the banking details so that we start doing that and keeping our POP.
2/2/24, 5:26 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Definitely we can! I am pleased to know that you have a long-term vision for Chiedza's higher education journey. Allow me to provide you with further details about the plan before we proceed with the formalities of payment and agreement signing. <This message was edited>
2/2/24, 5:27 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Considering these constraints, Edoofa Management has decided to help the parents and students prepare for the journey way ahead of time by helping them save money with Edoofa without any additional charges but rather saving additional money as well. Do you want me to explain how this has been achieved?
2/2/24, 5:45 PM - +263 77 277 0177: It's fine go ahead. Thank you
2/2/24, 8:21 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that we are together so far. Since my operational hours have concluded and I have had a long day already, let us conclude our conversation for today. We will reconnect tomorrow to further discuss the Financial Secure Plan and the way forward.

I wish you a blessed night!
2/2/24, 8:30 PM - +263 77 277 0177: Thank you, good night
3/2/24, 11:43 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Chiedza. How are you all doing this fine morning?
3/2/24, 11:45 AM - +263 77 277 0177: We are fine and you. Joice may be facing network challenges on her side. I will stand for her until she joins in. Thank you for getting in touch.
3/2/24, 12:01 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that you are all fine. I am doing well, thank you for asking.

I understand please, thank you for letting me know that. Allow me to continue our previous conversation, and explain how the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan is helpful in overcoming the constraints faced by students and parents.
3/2/24, 12:01 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Program Fee (Enrollment Fee) that you were asked to pay is $350. Under the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan, a parent has to deposit a small amount of money which is $150 every month for the next 10 months. 

That means, in 10 months, the money saved will be $1500. When this money is saved, Edoofa will waive off $150 from the Edoofa Program/Enrollment Fee of $350, thereby making a straight saving of $150 in 10 months.
3/2/24, 12:01 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Imagine you paying $15 every month to the Bank of Zimbabwe to keep your money safe, and here Edoofa is paying you $15 every month to keep your money safe. Now, you must be wondering, why only for 10 months and not for 20 months, right?
3/2/24, 12:04 PM - +263 77 277 0177: It's fine. Understood.
3/2/24, 12:05 PM - +263 77 277 0177: Bank charges considered and it becomes too much
3/2/24, 12:20 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Indeed. Considering these constraints, Edoofa Management has decided to help the parents and students prepare for the journey way ahead of time by helping them save money with Edoofa without any additional charges but rather saving additional money as well. Do you want me to explain how this has been achieved?
3/2/24, 12:20 PM - +263 77 277 0177: Sure, go ahead.
3/2/24, 12:54 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Program Fee (Enrollment Fee) that you were asked to pay is $350. Under the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan, a parent has to deposit a small amount of money which is $150 every month for the next 10 months. That means, in 10 months, the money saved will be $1500.
3/2/24, 12:54 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That means, in 10 months, the money saved will be $1500. When this money is saved, Edoofa will waive off $150 from the Edoofa Program/Enrollment Fee of $350, thereby making a straight saving of $150 in 10 months.
3/2/24, 12:54 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Imagine you paying $15 every month to the Bank of Zimbabwe to keep your money safe, and here Edoofa is paying you $15 every month to keep your money safe. Now, you must be wondering, why only for 10 months and not for 20 months, right?
4/2/24, 7:17 AM - +263 77 277 0177: Noted
5/2/24, 4:25 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Chiedza.

I hope you all had a great weekend. How is everything on your end today?
6/2/24, 6:41 AM - +263 77 277 0177: Good morning.  Sorry l could not attend l was travelling to Harare from Masvingo yesterday.
6/2/24, 2:27 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Chiedza.

I hope you are all doing great today. I understand please, thank you for letting me know that. Before we proceed with our discussion today, I would like to ask how your day has been going so far?
