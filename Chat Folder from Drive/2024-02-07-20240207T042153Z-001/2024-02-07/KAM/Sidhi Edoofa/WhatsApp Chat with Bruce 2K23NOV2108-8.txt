*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
21/12/23, 8:22 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.

Secondly an Edoofian aimes to be best in their career choice ...and there is the Edoofa program wanting to see an Edoofian do greater than best in their career paths and also wanting them to see success as independent individuals in life and their societies .

Thirdly the Edoofa program wishes for their enrolled students to have an affordable  tertiary education internationally in India ,thereby there to guide the upcoming Edoofians to acquire greater scholarships and also being able to earn scholarship credits for all the  universities in their program offer this enthusiastic EWYL program for all their students to acquire their scholarship credits also helping in reducing their tution fees .

And last, but not least , an Edoofian needs to have certain basic  skills of being able to convince the universities , so that the persons are thrilled and anxious to know what is it best of an Edoofian has to offer to their environment and all this is accompanied by a document that is called the Statement of Purpose .Also allowing the Edoofian to share their traits ,solid educational archievements and their strengths

2/1/24, 7:59 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. I did go through your responses and I can see you did understand all the videos. 

*Video 1: Important Message for Enrolled Students*

The first video underscores the importance of two crucial qualities: open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions. Edoofa's vision for its students is to foster success in their careers, and promote responsibility, and independence. A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.
2/1/24, 7:59 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s Vision for You*

Edoofa's vision for its students is to provide them with employment opportunities and the skills necessary to become future leaders. The program places students above other candidates by investing significant time and effort into finding reputable, education-focused institutions rather than solely business-oriented ones.
2/1/24, 7:59 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

In the third video, it is highlighted that Edoofa's founders have dedicated over a decade to meticulously identifying reputable educational institutions. Students are advised to cultivate the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to excel in the job market. All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to student's career goals.
2/1/24, 7:59 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools. It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.
2/1/24, 7:59 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: In summary, these videos emphasize the significance of qualities such as open-mindedness, following instructions, and cooperation. Edoofa's vision is to empower students for successful careers and leadership roles by carefully selecting educational institutions. The SOP is a vital tool for effective communication and admission success. 

I hope you agree with all of this and were able to understand these by watching the four videos?
2/1/24, 8:47 PM - +263 77 358 2224: Yes all in line
2/1/24, 9:25 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: As my available hours are coming to an end. I would like to let you know that I am now closing my session for today and let us proceed with the session tomorrow. Have a great night and my warm regards to your lovely family.

3. My dream company is Team Lease there in India and it is because this company offers a variety of employment opportunities to a variety of engineers who specialize in different paths .This is best for me because l love to see other engineers do their work not from my section so that l get to also learn how they do it and come up with a good result because you never know where this life takes one day l may need to use that kind of knowledge.

9/1/24, 9:10 PM - Dev Edoofa: Before we get into the specifics of your admission journey and talk about your admission process, I would like to share an exciting milestone that India as a country achieved within the first week of 2024 – the successful India's Chandrayaan-3 Engine Test. This accomplishment is responsible for the third lunar mission, aiming to land a rover on the Moon's south polar region and conduct scientific studies that could check Moon's viability to sustain life. It signifies a significant scientific advancement, laying the groundwork for future progress.

13/1/24, 8:14 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am delighted to hear that you want to become a better version of yourself by equipping new skills and helping others in need. This is something that is much appreciated to hear from such young minds who are already mature enough to be aware of the aspects they need to work on and helping their family. I must commend this.

However, since you are going to be occupied with school and your parents are occupied with work during the day, it seems that the same challenge in connectivity is going to persist for the next couple of months as well.
13/1/24, 8:14 AM - Dev Edoofa: With that being said, what I can do right now to solve this constraint is give you the freedom to choose the time slot for our sessions over the next 10 days [till 20th January].

26/1/24, 9:27 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Bruce,

I am *Ms. Siddhi Singh, Admission Officer at Edoofa*. Recently I was having a discussion with the Academic Board. They highlighted  that you have not been able to proceed with your admission process in a timely manner, since your child is at school and you have been occupied with work. Hence, I pitched in that I will be able to help you out and take over your application profile so that together we can ensure a timely and smooth progress. Since my operational hours accommodate your timings more suitably, I will be assuming the duties of your admission officer. I am optimistic that together, we can pave the way for an auspicious beginning to your academic journey, resulting in the right career prospects and eventual success for both you and your family.

27/1/24, 11:09 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to know that you are all doing well. I am doing fine myself, thank you for asking. Since this is the first time we are interacting, allow me to introduce myself. I am Miss Siddhi Singh, your Admission Officer. I belong from the vibrant city of Varanasi, known as one of the oldest living cities globally, Beyond my passion for education, I find joy in music and playing basketball. It is my pleasure to assist and guide you through the admission process, ensuring you achieve your dream education in India with the support of Edoofa.
27/1/24, 11:11 AM - +263 77 332 9674: And am also glad to know you Miss Siddhi ...and thank for the support
27/1/24, 11:43 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: The pleasure is mine. I was going through your application profile, and it is my understanding that you were able to successfully complete the 2nd step of the admission cycle i.e., Statement of Purpose. May I know if I am correct?
27/1/24, 11:45 AM - +263 77 332 9674: Yes yes you are very correct mam
27/1/24, 12:02 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for confirming that. I understand that you have school during the weekdays and your parents are occupied with work. In such a case, I want to ensure that our sessions are held in a timely and smooth manner so we can comfortably proceed with your application process. Could you kindly suggest a 1-hour slot between 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM when we can have our sessions?
27/1/24, 12:06 PM - +263 77 332 9674: We can schedule the session to start at  4.00 PM ..it wil be okay

27/1/24, 1:12 PM - +263 77 332 9674: Okay thank you will do so
29/1/24, 4:08 PM - +263 77 332 9674: Good afternoon
29/1/24, 4:12 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Bruce. I hope you are all doing well today. How has your day been going so far?
29/1/24, 4:15 PM - +263 77 332 9674: We are all okay l hope you are too...my day is quite okay just keeping up with my studies
29/1/24, 4:50 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to know that you are working hard on your studies Bruce. Moving forward with our discussion today,to confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is B.Tech (Electronics and Electrical Engineering) and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2025. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
29/1/24, 4:51 PM - +263 77 332 9674: Yes it's accurate ...
29/1/24, 5:23 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. Based on our experience of over 14 years and having assisted over 5000 students from different countries, we have realized that financial planning is the most important factor when a student plans for their higher education abroad.
29/1/24, 5:23 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am sure that you must be aware that 20-30% of students who are admitted into universities abroad are unable to fulfill their dream and come to India due to a lack of financial planning. The funds needed for booking flights, accommodation, and covering living expenses after arrival often become overwhelming, leading to the decision to defer their admission for a year. This, in turn, creates a gap in the child's education.
29/1/24, 5:23 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: To assist both students and parents in this regard, Edoofa Management has designed a Financial Secure Plan that aims to help you prepare for your higher educational finances without experiencing stress or last-minute rushes. I believe you must be wondering about the details of the same plan and how it helps the parents?
29/1/24, 5:41 PM - +263 77 332 9674: Yeah that's for sure am eager to know about this plan because l would really want to relieve my parents off the strees
29/1/24, 5:53 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: As much as I would like to continue with our discussion, since my operational hours for the day have already concluded, I would like to reconnect with you tomorrow at our scheduled time to further discuss the Financial Secure Plan and admission process. Until then, please take care and have a blessed day ahead!
29/1/24, 5:58 PM - +263 77 332 9674: Thank you and same to you
30/1/24, 4:02 PM - +263 77 332 9674: Hello good afternoon
30/1/24, 4:14 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Bruce.

I hope everything is well on your end. Before we proceed with our discussion, I would like to check in on you and your family. How are you all doing today?
30/1/24, 4:39 PM - +263 77 332 9674: We are doing all right how are you
30/1/24, 5:31 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. I am doing well too, thank you for asking. In our previous discussion, we were talking about the Financial Secure Plan. Edoofa Secure Plan is important for parents who have children joining the university for tertiary education in the next one to two years for several reasons:
30/1/24, 5:31 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 1. *Financial Preparedness:* The Edoofa Secure plan helps parents prepare financially for the costs after the Scholarship being offered so that they are not caught off guard.

2. *Reduced Financial Stress:* Having the Edoofa Secure Plan in place can significantly reduce the financial stress on you as parents when your child is about to enter university. Knowing that there is a dedicated fund for education expenses provides peace of mind.
30/1/24, 5:31 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 3. *Avoiding Debt*: Without proper savings, some parents may resort to taking out loans or accumulating credit card debt to cover their child's education costs. This Educational savings plan helps avoid the burden of debt and high-interest payments.

4. *Compound Interest:* By starting to save early and consistently contributing to the savings plan, parents can take advantage of compound interest, which can significantly increase the amount available for education expenses.
30/1/24, 5:31 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 5. *Flexibility and Control:* The Edoofa Secure savings plans allow parents to have greater control over their finances and how they allocate funds for their child's education. They can choose investment options that align with their risk tolerance and financial goals.

6. *Encouraging Responsibility*: Involving your child in the process of saving for their education teaches them financial responsibility and the value of higher education. It also motivates them to outperform in Academics.
30/1/24, 5:31 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 7. *Adapting to Unexpected Changes*: Life is full of surprises, and circumstances can change especially when there are political reforms changing each day impacting the Local Currency. Having an Edoofa Secure Plan allows parents to adapt to unexpected changes in their financial situation while still prioritizing their child's education.

8. *Peace of Mind:* Overall, having the Edoofa Secure plan provides parents with peace of mind, knowing that they are actively planning for their child's future and increasing the likelihood of providing them with a solid education.
30/1/24, 5:31 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, when you go through all the above benefits, I am sure you can see that the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan is an important financial tool for parents/students who are supposed to enter the university soon. 

It helps ensure that the financial aspect of tertiary education is well-managed, reduces stress, and allows parents to provide the best opportunities for their children without resorting to debt or financial hardship. Isn't this something you and your family also wish to have?
30/1/24, 5:49 PM - +263 77 332 9674: Yes it is exactly what we would like to have upon our future
30/1/24, 6:19 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I would love to continue with our discussion, however, my operational hours for the day have concluded. Let us reconnect tomorrow at our scheduled time to further discuss the Financial Secure Plan. I wish you a blessed day ahead!
30/1/24, 6:30 PM - +263 77 332 9674: Okay thank you
31/1/24, 4:10 PM - +263 77 332 9674: Hello
31/1/24, 4:16 PM - +263 77 332 9674: Good afternoon
31/1/24, 4:20 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Bruce. I hope you are having a wonderful day. How are you all doing today?
31/1/24, 4:23 PM - +263 77 332 9674: All well.we are having a wonderful day
31/1/24, 5:00 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that.  In our previous conversation, we had discussed certain details of the Financial Secure Plan. Allow me to help you understand it better. As you are aware, we are currently in January 2024, and we have a good 20 months to plan for your finances before you start your university education in 2025.
31/1/24, 5:00 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: During the counseling session, you were informed that at Edoofa, we guarantee a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship on the tuition fees. Hence, the cost of education, including food and accommodation after the scholarship, would be between $2000-$3000, and it could be even less. Not more than that.
31/1/24, 5:00 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This means that if you can save $150 per month for the next 20 months, you will be able to save $3000. This amount is more than enough for the first year of university fees, including tuition fees (if any), food, and accommodation. I hope you agree with this?
31/1/24, 5:01 PM - +263 77 332 9674: Yes true
31/1/24, 5:01 PM - +263 77 332 9674: Yes true
31/1/24, 5:02 PM - +263 77 332 9674: Mm yes that's true
31/1/24, 5:55 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Right, this means that by the time you would be in India, you would have already saved the $3000 that will cover the first-year fee.
31/1/24, 5:55 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, in these next 20 months, I am sure you would also be engaged in the EWYL program, and if you secure a minimum of $1000 in 20 months, that means the fees for 1.5 years are already secured.
31/1/24, 5:55 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, for a 3-year course, if we follow the same approach for the remaining 1.5 years, the educational journey for the student and the financial journey for the parent will be easy and smooth. I believe you must be able to see this perspective?
31/1/24, 5:56 PM - +263 77 332 9674: Oh yes
31/1/24, 5:58 PM - +263 77 332 9674: Clearly seen mam and l would to know about the transport costs too just to be sure
31/1/24, 7:04 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I was looking forward to continuing our conversation, however, my operational hours for the day have concluded, and I have had a long day already. I have taken a note of your query and we will discuss the same tomorrow. Let us conclude our conversation for today and we will reconnect tomorrow at our scheduled time to further discuss the Financial Secure Plan. Have a blessed night!
31/1/24, 8:27 PM - +263 77 332 9674: Thank you same to you
1/2/24, 4:19 PM - +263 77 332 9674: Good afternoon
1/2/24, 4:55 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Bruce.

I hope you are all doing great today. Kindly excuse me for the delay in my response as our team is currently engaged in the preparations for our upcoming Zimbabwe trip in February. May I know if you are available to proceed with our discussion?
1/2/24, 4:56 PM - +263 77 332 9674: Ohh okay no problem..
We can continue
1/2/24, 5:32 PM - +263 77 358 2224: Gd afternoon
2/2/24, 4:09 PM - +263 77 332 9674: Good afternoon
2/2/24, 4:49 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This message was deleted
2/2/24, 4:50 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Bruce.

I hope you are having a wonderful day. Kindly excuse me for not being able to respond to your message last night. Before we proceed with our discussion, I would like to ask how are you doing today?
2/2/24, 4:54 PM - +263 77 332 9674: We doing fine Ms ...and l hope we can continue with our discussion
2/2/24, 5:18 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Definitely, we will be continuing with our discussion today. During our previous interaction, we were discussing about the Financial Secure Plan. Allow me to proceed with the same.
2/2/24, 5:19 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: There is also another benefit, I am sure being in Zimbabwe you know how drastically the exchange rate fluctuates.
2/2/24, 5:19 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: If you are buying a dollar today, you might be spending 7000 bonds, but if you buy a dollar after a month, the rate would be different.
2/2/24, 5:19 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Also, even if you choose to buy dollars every month and save at your home, it is not safe since there is news of robbery, and mugging every day.
2/2/24, 5:19 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: In that case, you will opt to save in the Bank, but again we know that savings in the Bank require a Nostro Account which means you have to pay the bank to keep your money safe, right?
2/2/24, 5:50 PM - +263 77 332 9674: Yes that's true
2/2/24, 7:02 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is great to hear. Considering these constraints, Edoofa Management has decided to help the parents and students prepare for the journey way ahead of time by helping them save money with Edoofa without any additional charges but rather saving additional money as well. I will explain to you how this has been achieved during our next session.
2/2/24, 7:10 PM - +263 77 332 9674: Okay mam good to hear that ...
2/2/24, 8:23 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: On this note, let us conclude our conversation for today and we will reconnect tomorrow for our next session.

I wish you a blessed night!
2/2/24, 9:44 PM - +263 77 332 9674: Thanks same to you
3/2/24, 11:42 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Bruce. How are you all doing this fine morning?
3/2/24, 11:45 AM - +263 77 358 2224: Morning we are all fine
3/2/24, 11:59 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. In our previous conversation, I was explaining to you how the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan will help in overcoming the constraints.
3/2/24, 12:00 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Program Fee (Enrollment Fee) that you were asked to pay is $350. Under the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan, a parent has to deposit a small amount of money which is $150 every month for the next 10 months. 

That means, in 10 months, the money saved will be $1500. When this money is saved, Edoofa will waive off $150 from the Edoofa Program/Enrollment Fee of $350, thereby making a straight saving of $150 in 10 months.
3/2/24, 12:00 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Imagine you paying $15 every month to the Bank of Zimbabwe to keep your money safe, and here Edoofa is paying you $15 every month to keep your money safe. Now, you must be wondering, why only for 10 months and not for 20 months, right?
3/2/24, 12:23 PM - +263 77 358 2224: Ok sure
3/2/24, 12:24 PM - +263 77 332 9674: We doing okay
3/2/24, 12:25 PM - +263 77 332 9674: Yes would like to know
3/2/24, 12:55 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: If you see the bigger picture, you will realize that the reason is quite simple. Upon the completion of the 10 installments, the Edoofa Admissions team will initiate the Child’s Admission Process by applying early to the universities to secure their scholarship and their university seat.
3/2/24, 12:55 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Reserving seats earlier increases the chances of obtaining a maximum scholarship. A higher scholarship means lower fees, and by securing the seat, you will be entitled to pay the fees as per the old fee structure of the university, not the new one implemented in January 2025. Furthermore, when applying to the universities, you will receive an offer letter or a letter of intent detailing the fees, scholarship, and registration fees.
3/2/24, 12:56 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: As explained during the enrollment process, the registration fee is a portion of your first-year university fee, paid to reserve the seat. It ranges from $500-$1000 and is not an additional fee. 

From the $1500 you saved with Edoofa, the registration fee will be paid to the university, securing the seat. For instance, if the registration fee is $1000, Edoofa will pay $1000 from the $1500 saved in 10 months. The updated balance with Edoofa will be $500, which will be paid to the university upon your arrival in India.
3/2/24, 12:56 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This eases the financial burden on the parent, as there is no immediate payment required upon the student's arrival. The $500 saved will cover the remaining fees for the semester/year, as specified in the offer letter from the university. What are your thoughts on this?
3/2/24, 1:45 PM - +263 77 332 9674: I can say it is a good idea ...but can also be stressful upon my parents for they are trying to cover for 3 children.... so now  l can give sometime to my parents to digest all of the above
3/2/24, 2:10 PM - +263 77 358 2224: It is a good idea though we can,t afford to reserve $150 every month we have other siblings to look after so we can,t afford that
3/2/24, 2:11 PM - +263 77 358 2224: Maybe there should be another plan  thank you
5/2/24, 4:08 PM - +263 77 332 9674: Good afternoon
5/2/24, 4:18 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Bruce.

I hope you all had a great weekend. I was unable to respond to your message on Saturday as our operational hours on Saturdays are from 8:00 AM to 1:00 PM.
5/2/24, 4:19 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. However, the plan is not asking you to deposit extra funds. It is only allowing you to plan and consistently save small amounts from this month onwards, so that you do not face any financial constraints during August, when Bruce will start receiving offer letters from universities.
5/2/24, 4:23 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Let me provide you with a clearer understanding. In the 2024 intake, once students receive their offer letters, they must pay the registration amount of $500 to $1000 within 15 days. This tight timeframe has made it challenging for 20-30% of students to proceed with their higher education in India.

To address this issue, Edoofa has introduced the Financial Secure Plan. By depositing $150 each month, you can start saving for Bruce's first year of education now. This plan aims to ease any future financial pressures during the registration period.
5/2/24, 4:26 PM - +263 77 358 2224: Gd afternoon
5/2/24, 4:26 PM - +263 77 358 2224: Ok now clear thank you
5/2/24, 4:27 PM - +263 77 358 2224: Sure it's good thank  you for that
5/2/24, 4:48 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that we are on the same page. With this plan for the next 10 months, I am sure you must be wondering what will happen in the next 10 months, considering you have already secured your scholarship seat with the university due to your hard work in the first 10 months. Is my understanding correct?
5/2/24, 4:52 PM - +263 77 358 2224: Correct
5/2/24, 5:17 PM - +263 77 332 9674: Correct
5/2/24, 5:39 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Let me help you with that as well. In the 11th month, you will be guided to open an FBC Mastercard bank account in Zimbabwe with a deposit of $150. The reason for this is that when you apply for your student Visa, the Embassy asks for a Bank Statement, and this account will serve that purpose.
5/2/24, 5:39 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: We understand it might be expensive if you deposit another $1500 for the remaining 10 months in FB  Bank Zimbabwe, so to avoid the same challenges, we have designed the plan accordingly. You will only be depositing for the 11th, 12th, 13th, and 14th month, which is 4 months.
5/2/24, 5:39 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Once the 4 months are completed, our Department of Student Welfare (DSW) team will assist you with your visa process. The bank statement will act as one of the required documents, and once you receive the visa, you can withdraw the amount from FBC and book the flight ticket. This will help you utilize the money as well. How does it sound?
5/2/24, 5:59 PM - +263 77 332 9674: Oooh okay l understand this one ....
5/2/24, 6:21 PM - +263 77 358 2224: Ok l understand
6/2/24, 2:24 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Bruce.

I hope you are all doing wonderful today. I am pleased to hear that we are on the same page with our discussion. Before we proceed, I would like to ask how your day has been going so far?
6/2/24, 3:01 PM - +263 77 332 9674: My day is okay ..and yours? <This message was edited>
6/2/24, 3:22 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. My day has been going good, thank you for asking. In our previous session, we had discussed how the Financial Secure Plan works for the first 15 months. Now, from the 16th Month till the 20th month, considering it is a 6-month window, you can again continue depositing the money ($150) with Edoofa which can be used in the fee as and when required or you can decide to save this $900 of these 6 months with you as well. This is something which you are free to choose. I hope you have understood the financial secure plan now?
6/2/24, 4:02 PM - +263 77 332 9674: Yes l have ...but let's l hope it all goes well because it is quite costly for my family  so l pray it all goes well .
6/2/24, 4:05 PM - +263 77 332 9674: And if l can ask , what if l fail to reach that amount in time what will be next ...with my process and future?
6/2/24, 4:10 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: In case you are unable to make the monthly deposits on time, kindly inform us beforehand so that we can understand your situation and work together to find a solution for it.
6/2/24, 4:10 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now that you have all the information, I want you to take some time and discuss the financial security plan with your family members. Help them understand its importance and details. Once you're done, we can reconnect, have a discussion, and address any queries you may have. After resolving your concerns, I'll guide you through starting your financial security plan. 

While most students can discuss this with their family the same day, I understand everyone is different. Could you let me know when you think you'll have the discussion with your family? This way, we can schedule our next session accordingly.
6/2/24, 4:37 PM - +263 77 332 9674: Okay
6/2/24, 4:39 PM - +263 77 332 9674: I think by Monday l would have discussed the issue with them
6/2/24, 5:00 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: May I know if your parents are currently unavailable for you to have this discussion with them?
6/2/24, 5:06 PM - +263 77 358 2224: We are fyn
6/2/24, 5:15 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. May I know if you will have the opportunity to discuss the plan by tomorrow or day after?
6/2/24, 5:18 PM - +263 77 358 2224: I think we will discuss during the weekend his father is not around and he is not on WhatsApp so l think Monday  we will give you the update
6/2/24, 5:24 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. Having a detailed discussion with him is quite important and if he is going to be available on the weekend, I hope that you will be able to discuss the same with him during the upcoming weekend.

On this note, let us conclude our conversation here and we will reconnect in a few days' time.  I hope that by then you will be able to have the discussion with Bruce's father. Have a blessed evening ahead!
6/2/24, 5:28 PM - +263 77 358 2224: Sure thank you same to you
