I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them.

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
31/1/24, 1:57 PM - Tinashe Zengeya -  Estate Manager ZW: Yes go ahead
31/1/24, 2:16 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
31/1/24, 2:24 PM - Tinashe Zengeya -  Estate Manager ZW: Done
31/1/24, 2:24 PM - Tinashe Zengeya -  Estate Manager ZW: Lets proceed
31/1/24, 2:54 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
31/1/24, 2:54 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
31/1/24, 3:03 PM - Tinashe Zengeya -  Estate Manager ZW: Its clear
31/1/24, 3:03 PM - Tinashe Zengeya -  Estate Manager ZW: This one it has to be filled with the student right? Not us parents, confirm
31/1/24, 3:30 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Yes, that is indeed correct. However, if Tinevimbo is unavailable to do so, you may take his inputs and fill the form on his behalf. It is crucial that Tinevimbo shares his inputs for the same, as the Statement of Purpose will be a representation of his skills and interests.
31/1/24, 3:30 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps - 

*Step 3: Introduction to the Financial Secure Plan* - Parents with children embarking on their university journey within the next one to two years face important decision-making and rigorous financial planning. Edoofa recognizes the significance of this transition and hence has introduced the Edoofa Secure Plan - a unique and systematic strategy to empower parents in financial planning and preparing for their child's tertiary education well in advance.
31/1/24, 3:30 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Scholarship Offer Letter from the university would be issued next year in the month of August.

I hope you are following?
31/1/24, 3:49 PM - Tinashe Zengeya -  Estate Manager ZW: Following
31/1/24, 3:50 PM - Tinashe Zengeya -  Estate Manager ZW: So what exactly will you be assisting with here?
31/1/24, 4:39 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: We will be offering you a flexible payment plan, that you can avail in order to prevent any last minute financial constraints or challenges that might come your way due to unforeseen situations.
31/1/24, 4:40 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. The registration fee will be paid through the savings you have accumulated visa the Financial Secure Plan. After the registration fee is paid, for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
31/1/24, 4:40 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
31/1/24, 4:42 PM - Tinashe Zengeya -  Estate Manager ZW: On the issue of Acceptance letter how do i know we have been accepted with the best University. Because the issue is for the child to get the best quality education. What criteria will you be using in choosing the Universities
31/1/24, 5:27 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: The Edoofa Scholarship Program has worked with over 250 universities, all of which are recognized by UGC (University Grants Commission) and AICTE (All India Council for Technical Education). We have been working in the industry for the past 15+ years, and have carefully hand-picked these universities that excel in exposure, affordability, culture, and academics. <This message was edited>
31/1/24, 5:27 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: The Academic Board at Edoofa will evaluate students' applications in the month of August. Based on various factors such as their A Level Statement of Entry, O Level Results, merit, extracurricular activities, Statement of Purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa, they will finalize a list of universities where your child's application will be shared. Subsequently, you will receive offer letters from these universities and will have the option to choose the best university for Tinevimbo if you receive multiple offer letters. Until then, our goal is to assist you in preparing your educational finances so that once you receive the offer letters, you can secure the scholarship seat promptly. I hope you are clear with this?

3/2/24, 9:35 AM - Tinashe Zengeya -  Estate Manager ZW: Yes go ahead
3/2/24, 9:36 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
3/2/24, 9:36 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding. Until you are ready, shall we start with our discussion with me individually? 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
3/2/24, 9:40 AM - Tinashe Zengeya -  Estate Manager ZW: Can you kindly share the videos so that i can watch then on a good time and then i will let you know when im done.

3/2/24, 9:45 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
3/2/24, 9:45 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
3/2/24, 9:45 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
3/2/24, 9:45 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
3/2/24, 9:45 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection. 

Please go through the 4 videos, since you mention that you will need some time to watch the videos, our next session will be scheduled for Monday after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarize your understanding.
5/2/24, 2:32 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. Let me share my views as well so that it will help you expand your understanding.

*Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students:* In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. 

You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent.
5/2/24, 2:32 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s vision for you:* Here our founders talk about the most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of tomorrow.
5/2/24, 2:32 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program:* Talking about the third video, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
5/2/24, 2:32 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP:* Another thing is that Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based. 

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
5/2/24, 2:33 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Kindly let me know once you are able to go through the explanations.
5/2/24, 2:40 PM - Tinashe Zengeya -  Estate Manager ZW: Loud and clear, thanks for enlighting me more.
5/2/24, 2:57 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: You are most welcome. Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose. I hope you were able to follow through with this?
5/2/24, 2:59 PM - Tinashe Zengeya -  Estate Manager ZW: Yes yes
5/2/24, 3:10 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move Tinevimbo's application ahead and help Tinevimbo to write a proper statement of purpose so that he can get into the best University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on Tinevimbo's application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, we would require Tinevimbo's availability for approximately 30 minutes. If he is unavailable, he can provide you with his input, and you can proceed with the statement of purpose on his behalf. <This message was edited>
5/2/24, 3:12 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in Tinevimbo's admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

At that point, we will be prepared to move on to the third step, which involves Introduction to the Financial Secure Plan. <This message was edited>

6/2/24, 1:06 PM - Tinashe Zengeya -  Estate Manager ZW: How are you

6/2/24, 1:43 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the message with me. I am pleased to hear that your day is going well. Everything is good here, thank you for asking. May I know if you were able to complete the SOP form that I shared with you yesterday?
6/2/24, 2:50 PM - Tinashe Zengeya -  Estate Manager ZW: Not yet will be able to fill in tonight
6/2/24, 3:09 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. In such a case, I will look forward to receiving an update from your end once you are able to complete the form, and in the meanwhile, let us move forward with our discussion.
6/2/24, 3:09 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is BCom (Accounting and International Finance) and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2025. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
6/2/24, 3:30 PM - Tinashe Zengeya -  Estate Manager ZW: Thats correct
6/2/24, 3:30 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. Based on our experience of over 14 years and having assisted over 5000 students from different countries, we have realized that financial planning is the most important factor when a student plans for their higher education abroad.
6/2/24, 3:30 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am sure that you must be aware that 20-30% of students who are admitted into universities abroad are unable to fulfill their dream and come to India due to a lack of financial planning. The funds needed for booking flights, accommodation, and covering living expenses after arrival often become overwhelming, leading to the decision to defer their admission for a year. This, in turn, creates a gap in the child's education.
6/2/24, 3:30 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: To assist both students and parents in this regard, Edoofa Management has designed a Financial Secure Plan that aims to help you prepare for your higher educational finances without experiencing stress or last-minute rushes. I believe you must be wondering about the details of the same plan and how it helps the parents?
6/2/24, 3:32 PM - Tinashe Zengeya -  Estate Manager ZW: Go ahead
6/2/24, 4:02 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Edoofa Secure Plan is important for parents who have children joining the university for tertiary education in the next one to two years for several reasons:
6/2/24, 4:02 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 1. *Financial Preparedness:* The Edoofa Secure plan helps parents prepare financially for the costs after the Scholarship being offered so that they are not caught off guard.

2. *Reduced Financial Stress:* Having the Edoofa Secure Plan in place can significantly reduce the financial stress on you as parents when your child is about to enter university. Knowing that there is a dedicated fund for education expenses provides peace of mind.
6/2/24, 4:02 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 3. *Avoiding Debt*: Without proper savings, some parents may resort to taking out loans or accumulating credit card debt to cover their child's education costs. This Educational savings plan helps avoid the burden of debt and high-interest payments.

4. *Compound Interest:* By starting to save early and consistently contributing to the savings plan, parents can take advantage of compound interest, which can significantly increase the amount available for education expenses.
6/2/24, 4:02 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 5. *Flexibility and Control:* The Edoofa Secure savings plans allow parents to have greater control over their finances and how they allocate funds for their child's education. They can choose investment options that align with their risk tolerance and financial goals.

6. *Encouraging Responsibility*: Involving your child in the process of saving for their education teaches them financial responsibility and the value of higher education. It also motivates them to outperform in Academics.
6/2/24, 4:02 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 7. *Adapting to Unexpected Changes*: Life is full of surprises, and circumstances can change especially when there are political reforms changing each day impacting the Local Currency. Having an Edoofa Secure Plan allows parents to adapt to unexpected changes in their financial situation while still prioritizing their child's education.

8. *Peace of Mind:* Overall, having the Edoofa Secure plan provides parents with peace of mind, knowing that they are actively planning for their child's future and increasing the likelihood of providing them with a solid education.
6/2/24, 4:02 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, when you go through all the above benefits, I am sure you can see that the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan is an important financial tool for parents/students who are supposed to enter the university soon. 

It helps ensure that the financial aspect of tertiary education is well-managed, reduces stress, and allows parents to provide the best opportunities for their children without resorting to debt or financial hardship. Isn't this something you and your family also wish to have?
