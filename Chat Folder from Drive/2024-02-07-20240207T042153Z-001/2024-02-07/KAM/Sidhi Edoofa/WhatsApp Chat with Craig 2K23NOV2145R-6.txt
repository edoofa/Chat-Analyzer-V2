19/12/23, 10:22 AM - You joined using this group's invite link
19/12/23, 7:09 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening!

I hope you are doing well and blessed today. Please excuse me for the late reply. I was occupied with a university official today. May I know if you are available to proceed with our session?
19/12/23, 7:20 PM - +263 71 855 2335: Good evening! 
Yes we can proceed
19/12/23, 7:20 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that, may I know if you were able to go through the above points?
19/12/23, 7:31 PM - +263 71 855 2335: Yes we were able to go through it
19/12/23, 7:32 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through the above points, do you want me to help you understand how the Edoofa Secure Plan works?
19/12/23, 7:39 PM - +263 71 855 2335: Yes
19/12/23, 7:49 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, as you are aware, we are currently in December 2023, and we have a good 20-21 months to plan for your finances before you start your university education in 2025.
19/12/23, 7:49 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: During the counseling session, you were informed that at Edoofa, we guarantee a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship on the tuition fees. Hence, the cost of education, including food and accommodation after the scholarship, would be between $2000-$3000, and it could be even less. Not more than that.
19/12/23, 7:49 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: This means that if you can save $150 per month for the next 20 months, you will be able to save $3000. This amount is more than enough for the first year of university fees, including tuition fees (if any), food, and accommodation. I hope you agree with this?
19/12/23, 7:56 PM - +263 71 855 2335: Yes we do
19/12/23, 7:56 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Right, this means that by the time you would be in India, you would have already saved the $3000 that will cover the first-year fee.
19/12/23, 7:56 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, in these next 20 months, I am sure you would also be engaged in the EWYL program, and if you secure to earn a minimum of $1000 in 20 months, that means the fees for 1.5 years are already secured.
19/12/23, 7:56 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, for a 3-year course, if we follow the same approach for the remaining 1.5 years, the educational journey for the student and the financial journey for the parent will be easy and smooth. I believe you must be able to see this perspective?
19/12/23, 8:06 PM - +263 71 855 2335: Yes we do
19/12/23, 8:07 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. With that said, there is also another benefit, I am sure being in Zimbabwe you know how drastically the exchange rate fluctuates.
19/12/23, 8:07 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: If you are buying a dollar today, you might be spending 5000 bonds, but if you buy a dollar after a month, the rate would be different.
19/12/23, 8:07 PM - +263 77 293 4976: Good evening everyone
Yes it can be achieved though it's a difficult journey
19/12/23, 8:07 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Also, even if you choose to buy dollars every month and save at your home, it is not safe since there is news of robbery, and mugging every day.
19/12/23, 8:07 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: In that case, you will opt to save in the Bank, but again we know that savings in the Bank require a Nostro Account which means you have to pay the bank to keep your money safe, right?
19/12/23, 8:07 PM - +263 77 293 4976: Correct
19/12/23, 8:08 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is great to hear, considering these constraints, Edoofa Management has decided to help the parents and students prepare for the journey way ahead of time by helping them save money with Edoofa without any additional charges but rather saving additional money as well. Do you want me to explain how this has been achieved?
19/12/23, 8:09 PM - +263 77 293 4976: Please explain
19/12/23, 8:25 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Program Fee (Enrollment Fee) that you were asked to pay is $350. From the $350, you have already paid $200, and the remaining $150 is what you are planning to pay. <This message was edited>
19/12/23, 8:25 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Under the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan, a parent has to deposit a small amount of money which is $150 every month for the next 10 months. 

That means, in 10 months, the money saved will be $1500. When this money is saved, Edoofa will waive off the remaining $150 which was due from the Edoofa Program/Enrollment Fee of $350, thereby making a straight saving of $150 in 10 months.
19/12/23, 8:26 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Imagine you paying $15 every month to the Bank of Zimbabwe to keep your money safe, and here Edoofa is paying you $15 every month to keep your money safe. Now, you must be wondering, why only for 10 months and not for 20 months, right?
19/12/23, 8:29 PM - +263 71 855 2335: Yes
19/12/23, 8:41 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: If you see the bigger picture, you will realize that the reason is quite simple. Upon the completion of the 10 installments, the Edoofa Admissions team will initiate the Child’s Admission Process by applying early to the universities to secure their scholarship and their university seat.
19/12/23, 8:42 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Reserving seats earlier increases the chances of obtaining a maximum scholarship. A higher scholarship means lower fees, and by securing the seat, you will be entitled to pay the fees as per the old fee structure of the university, not the new one implemented in January 2025. Furthermore, when applying to the universities, you will receive an offer letter or a letter of intent detailing the fees, scholarship, and registration fee.
19/12/23, 8:42 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: As explained during the enrollment process, the registration fee is a portion of your first-year university fee, paid to reserve the seat. It ranges from $500-$1000 and is not an additional fee. 

From the $1500 you saved with Edoofa, the registration fee will be paid to the university, securing the seat. For instance, if the registration fee is $1000, Edoofa will pay $1000 from the $1500 saved in 10 months. The updated balance with Edoofa will be $500, which will be paid to the university upon your arrival in India.
19/12/23, 8:42 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: This eases the financial burden on the parent, as there is no immediate payment required upon the student's arrival. The $500 saved will cover the remaining fees for the semester/year, as specified in the offer letter from the university. What are your thoughts on this?
19/12/23, 8:55 PM - +263 77 293 4976: This plan is good
19/12/23, 8:57 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for being online and proceeding with the session with me for today. As my available hours are coming to an end I am closing our session for now and let us continuw tomorrow. Have a great day and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
19/12/23, 8:58 PM - +263 77 293 4976: You're welcome
19/12/23, 9:03 PM - +263 77 293 4976: May you also be blessed for your patience
20/12/23, 6:16 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, dear parents and Craig!

I hope you are doing well today. I would like to let you know that our available hours daily will be from 6:00 pm to 9:00 pm every day for this session. With that said may I know if you are now ready to proceed with the session?
20/12/23, 7:42 PM - +263 77 293 4976: How are you sir and all Edoofa team
20/12/23, 7:49 PM - +263 71 855 2335: Good evening 
Yes we may proceed
20/12/23, 7:51 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to see that we are together so far. With this plan for the next 10 months, I am sure you must be wondering what will happen in the next 10 months, considering you have already secured your scholarship seat with the university due to your hard work in the first 10 months. Is my understanding correct?
20/12/23, 7:52 PM - +263 71 855 2335: Yes
20/12/23, 8:06 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let me help you with that as well. In the 11th month, you will be guided to open an FBC Mastercard bank account in Zimbabwe with a deposit of $150. The reason for this is that when you apply for your student Visa, the Embassy asks for a Bank Statement, and this account will serve that purpose.
20/12/23, 8:06 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: We understand it might be expensive if you deposit another $1500 for the remaining 10 months in FB  Bank Zimbabwe, so to avoid the same challenges, we have designed the plan accordingly. You will only be depositing for the 11th, 12th, 13th, and 14th month, which is 4 months.
20/12/23, 8:06 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once the 4 months are completed, our Department of Student Welfare (DSW) team will assist you with your visa process. The bank statement will act as one of the required documents, and once you receive the visa, you can withdraw the amount from FBC and book the flight ticket. This will help you utilize the money as well. How does it sound?
20/12/23, 8:11 PM - +263 77 293 4976: This is understood so how much is the plane ticket
20/12/23, 8:12 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: The plane ticket will be ranging from $400 to $600
20/12/23, 8:14 PM - +263 77 293 4976: Ok it's clear
20/12/23, 8:20 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now, from the 16th Month till the 20th month, considering it is a 6-month window, you can again continue depositing the money ($150) with Edoofa which can be used in the fee as and when required or you can decide to save this $900 of these 6 months with you as well. This is something which you are free to choose. I hope you have understood the financial secure plan now?
20/12/23, 8:48 PM - +263 77 293 4976: I understand
20/12/23, 8:54 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for being online and proceeding with the session with me for today. As my available hours are coming to an end I am closing our session for now and let us continue tomorrow. Have a great day and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
20/12/23, 8:57 PM - +263 77 293 4976: We also thank you very much. Good night and have a great day ahead
21/12/23, 6:03 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening, dear parents and Craig !

I hope this message finds you well and blessed. May I know if you are currently available so that we can proceed with the session for your admission process?
21/12/23, 7:00 PM - +263 77 293 4976: Good evening all. How are you today
21/12/23, 7:16 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am great, thank you for asking. May I know if you are now ready to proceed with the session?
21/12/23, 7:22 PM - +263 77 293 4976: We're ready
21/12/23, 8:03 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: That's great. Now that you have all the information, I want you to take some time and discuss the financial security plan with your family members. Help them understand its importance and details. Once you're done, we can reconnect, have a discussion, and address any queries you may have. After resolving your concerns, I'll guide you through starting your financial security plan. 

While most students can discuss this with their parents the same day, I understand everyone is different. Could you let me know by when you think you'll have the discussion with your parents? This way, we can schedule our next session accordingly.
21/12/23, 8:46 PM - +263 71 855 2335: I will discuss with them by tomorrow
21/12/23, 8:59 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for being online and proceeding with the session with me for today. As my available hours are coming to an end I am closing our session for now and let us continue tomorrow properly. Have a great day and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
21/12/23, 9:04 PM - +263 71 855 2335: Thank you and have a great day to you too
27/12/23, 12:06 PM - +263 77 293 4976: <Media omitted>
27/12/23, 7:38 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening dear parents and Craig. I hope this message finds you well and blessed. 

It has been a while. May I know if you are now ready to proceed with the session for your admission process?
27/12/23, 7:39 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the payment receipt of your Enrollment Fee. It has been duly noted with us and we have shared it with the accounts team as well for payment confirmation. 

Once the payment is confirmed by the accounts team and the amount has been reflected in India, we will notify you accordingly.
27/12/23, 7:47 PM - +263 71 855 2335: Good evening 
Yes we can proceed
27/12/23, 7:47 PM - +263 71 855 2335: Please do
27/12/23, 8:02 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. In relations to the previous discussion. May I know what are your thought about the edoofa secure plan?
27/12/23, 8:04 PM - +263 71 855 2335: It is really good because it clearly shows you how to save money in a strategic way securely
27/12/23, 8:05 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. May I know by when you might be able to commence with the plan?
27/12/23, 8:08 PM - +263 71 855 2335: As from January
27/12/23, 8:15 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. In that case, I shall share the same with the account team and the academic board as well. I wish you to have a great day and a Happy New year.
27/12/23, 8:17 PM - +263 71 855 2335: Same to you
27/12/23, 8:25 PM - +263 77 293 4976: How are you Edoofa team.We thank you and Wish you all a blessed 2024

9/1/24, 9:20 PM - Dev Edoofa: In the past few days, I had an in-depth discussion with Mr. Shivjeet and had the opportunity to review your scholarship application file in our records. Through this process, I gained valuable insights into your dreams and aspirations to advance your academic career. Upon reviewing your application file, I was both impressed and reassured to assist you in achieving these goals here in India, which will unlock doors to incredible opportunities in the future.
9/1/24, 9:20 PM - Dev Edoofa: Before we get into the specifics of your admission journey and talk about your admission process, I would like to share an exciting milestone that India as a country achieved within the first week of 2024 – the successful India's Chandrayaan-3 Engine Test. This accomplishment is responsible for the third lunar mission, aiming to land a rover on the Moon's south polar region and conduct scientific studies that could check Moon's viability to sustain life. It signifies a significant scientific advancement, laying the groundwork for future progress.
9/1/24, 9:20 PM - Dev Edoofa: This achievement has not only pushed boundaries but also inspired young minds all over the world to pursue their dreams. On the same note, I wanted to extend my heartiest wishes for the New Year to you and your family and check in to see how you and your family started your year?

12/1/24, 9:21 AM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you so much for the warm welcome and for having so much faith in us. I hope you are excited for the new day and most importantly the new year as well. @263772934976, the new year brings about a transformative mindset in us which may not emphasize immediate changes but a change in the direction that you believe is needed.

If I talk about myself, I have made a resolution to bring more humility in myself and bring about a change in my perspective to be a better version of myself all while ensuring that I help all of our students to achieve their educational goals. With that said, I would like to know what aspirations or a change in your approach towards life you wish to achieve?
12/1/24, 5:34 PM - +263 77 293 4976: Greetings to you all
Sir Dev may you be blessed in your vision to bring change to aspiring students
As for me l wish to come out with nearly 100 percent literacy rate as l am teaching grade 1s this year. I also wish to help and encourage Craig achieve good results for his future dream
12/1/24, 8:30 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am truly moved by your determination to teach children and spread awareness about education. We truly appreciate your efforts and wish that you succeed as well.

We will be able to help you only if we can connect timely and have healthy discussions.
12/1/24, 8:31 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, this is something I want to inform you all that the agenda for the discussions, that we are going to have, is to help you all understand the process you will undertake for his university admission journey and what your family will be experiencing with the Edoofa Scholarship Program over the next one and a half years. However, since you are going to be occupied with school and your parents are occupied with work during the day, it seems that the same challenge in connectivity is going to persist for the next couple of months as well.
12/1/24, 8:31 PM - Dev Edoofa: With that being said, what I can do right now to solve this constraint is give you the freedom to choose the time slot for our sessions over the next 10 days [till 20th January]. This way, we can align it with our availability as well and help you move forward and make progress in a streamlined manner. Could you please let me know at what time you would be available from Monday to Friday between 08:00 AM and 06:00 PM? This would help us factor in your input and find the right time for our sessions.

26/1/24, 9:34 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Craig,

I am *Ms. Siddhi Singh, Admission Officer at Edoofa*. Recently I was having a discussion with the Academic Board. They highlighted  that you have not been able to proceed with your admission process in a timely manner, since your child is at school and you have been occupied with work. Hence, I pitched in that I will be able to help you out and take over your application profile so that together we can ensure a timely and smooth progress. Since my operational hours accommodate your timings more suitably, I will be assuming the duties of your admission officer. I am optimistic that together, we can pave the way for an auspicious beginning to your academic journey, resulting in the right career prospects and eventual success for both you and your family.

Thank you for sharing the payment receipt with me. I have taken a note for the same. Since you have been one of the most dedicated students, and I see you have great aspirations, I wanted you to be a part of the same set of students and start with your future planning the right way.
1/2/24, 8:23 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Also, as this plan commences from the month of February, for the efficient implementation of this plan, we need to decide on a fixed date on which you will deposit $150 every month. This will provide you with the flexibility to align your finances accordingly.

In light of the same, may I know the fixed date every month on which you will deposit $150?
