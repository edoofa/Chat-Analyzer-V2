29/12/23, 4:05 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon dear parents and Patience

I hope this message finds you well and blessed. It has been a while since the last time we were connected with each other. As I was occupied with university obligations and Christmas preparations, I would like to take this opportunity to inquire how you are doing today?
29/12/23, 4:27 PM - +263 77 133 7570: Doing well this side, how are you doing
29/12/23, 4:30 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am great, thank you for asking. If you are comfortable shall we proceed with the session for the admission process?
29/12/23, 4:58 PM - +263 77 133 7570: Please proceed
29/12/23, 5:01 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Since you are active now, I wanted to know if you were able to recall our past discussions about the admission process so that we can proceed with the session smoothly?
29/12/23, 5:20 PM - +263 77 133 7570: Yes, all information recalled: deposits for 10 months, in your Account then 4 months deposits in FBC account, both $150 per month.
29/12/23, 6:02 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is correct. Now, from the 16th Month till the 20th month, considering it is a 6-month window, you can again continue depositing the money ($150) with Edoofa which can be used in the fee as and when required or you can decide to save this $900 of these 6 months with you as well. This is something which you are free to choose. I hope you have understood the financial secure plan now?
29/12/23, 6:32 PM - +263 77 133 7570: We have understood the plan and we even appreciate but we choose to save the money with ourselves from the first month.
29/12/23, 6:52 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. I would like to let you know that the above plan is mandatory for all the students.
29/12/23, 7:08 PM - +263 77 133 7570: So when are we expected to make the first deposit
29/12/23, 7:18 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: we can commence that from the next month.
29/12/23, 8:56 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you so much for taking the time and being online with me today. As my available hours are coming to an end I am closing the session for today and let us connect on the 2nd of January. Along with that, as we stand on the threshold of a new year, I extend my heartfelt wishes to you and your family for a prosperous and fulfilling 2024. May this year bring new opportunities, fresh beginnings, and the realization of your dreams and aspirations.

I hope the coming year is filled with success, health, and happiness for you and your loved ones. May it be a year that surpasses all expectations and is replete with moments of joy and achievement.

9/1/24, 9:30 PM - Dev Edoofa: Before we get into the specifics of your admission journey and talk about your admission process, I would like to share an exciting milestone that India as a country achieved within the first week of 2024 – the successful India's Chandrayaan-3 Engine Test. This accomplishment is responsible for the third lunar mission, aiming to land a rover on the Moon's south polar region and conduct scientific studies that could check Moon's viability to sustain life. It signifies a significant scientific advancement, laying the groundwork for future progress.

Hence, I pitched in that I will be able to help you out and take over your application profile so that together we can ensure a timely and smooth progress. Since my operational hours accommodate your timings more suitably, I will be assuming the duties of your admission officer.

I hope you are having a wonderful day. Kindly excuse me for not being able to respond to your last message, as our team is currently working tirelessly for the preparation of our upcoming Zimbabwe trip in the month of February. Before we proceed with our discussion, how are you doing today?
2/2/24, 3:17 PM - +263 78 465 9820: That's understandable.  I'm doing well and yourself
2/2/24, 3:55 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that you are well. I am fine too, thank you for asking. Before reaching out to you today, I was going through pictures and videos from Edoofa's very first SLICE CON held last week, and that sparked my curiosity about whether you are familiar with what SLICE CON is or not?
2/2/24, 4:42 PM - +263 78 465 9820: No I'm not
2/2/24, 5:13 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is alright, Let me tell you a bit about the same.  Recently, Edoofa hosted a conference called the Symposium of Leaders, Innovators, and Creators at Edoofa, also known as 'SLICE-CON.'
2/2/24, 5:13 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: The conference was attended by all the Edoofians of 2023 and a few senior Edoofians from previous batches. It focused on the art of creation, innovation, and, most importantly, the mindset required to make an impact in one's career.
2/2/24, 5:13 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: During this Industrial Visit and the conference - SLICE CON, Corporate leaders, such as the CEOs and Co-founders from renowned companies like Rage Coffee, Sirona Hygiene, Jolin New York, and more, shared their insights and experiences. These individuals are at the helm of multi-millionaire brands, leading large marketing teams. Their presence added immense value, providing students with the opportunity to engage in transformative conversations.
2/2/24, 5:13 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Let me share a glimpse of the conference with you and your family. I am certain that you too would be this excited to attend such events when he comes to India.

2/2/24, 5:13 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Let me know once you are able to go through the messages about the SLICE CON, along with the images and videos shared with you. This was indeed a momentous step for all of our students, making them employable ready and giving them access to the right opportunities for their careers ahead.
2/2/24, 5:42 PM - +263 78 465 9820: This is amazing 😊 I'm also looking forward to such an opportunity I'm sure it's a great start for a transformative in one's career
2/2/24, 6:29 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Certainly, Patience. Also, regarding the discussion we had the other day about the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan, I wanted to follow up on our last conversation. Have you, as a family, been able to discuss it? If so, I would like to understand how the discussion went. What were their thoughts about it? Did they have any specific queries or concerns that you would like us to address?
2/2/24, 6:35 PM - +263 78 465 9820: Yes ,but I think my parents are in a better position to  answer regarding this .
2/2/24, 8:12 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. As my operational hours have concluded and I have had a long day already, let us conclude our conversation for today. We will reconnect tomorrow for our session and I hope that by then your parents will be able to share their thoughts about the Financial Secure Plan by then.

I wish you a blessed night!
5/2/24, 1:25 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Patience.

I hope you all had a great weekend. How is everything on your end today?
6/2/24, 1:09 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Patience.

I hope you are all doing wonderful today. I was hoping to get a response from your end yesterday, however it seems like due to some reason we are unable to connect with each other. Hence, I wanted to reach out and inquire if everything is alright with you and your family. May I know if everything is well on your end? <This message was edited>
6/2/24, 1:16 PM - +263 77 133 7570: Good afternoon
We are all doing well. How are you
6/2/24, 1:45 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. I am doing good, thank you for asking. During our previous session, I had asked you if you have been able to discuss the Financial Secure Plan with your family. May I know if you have gotten the opportunity to do the same?
6/2/24, 1:56 PM - +263 77 133 7570: Yes, we had a discussion and came to the conclusion that, we are not financially strong to be able to be paying current school fees and paying that for next year at the same time, l don't know if you have an alternative plan.
6/2/24, 1:59 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. It can get a bit challenging if you are paying the current school year fees along with saving for Patience's higher education. However, the plan does not require you to make any extra expenditures. It is only giving you the benefit of saving small amounts from today onwards, so that you do not face any financial constraints when it is time to pay for the registration amount. Allow me to help you to gain a better understanding of the same:
6/2/24, 2:04 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: For the 2024 intake, upon receiving their offer letters from the university, students are required to pay a registration fee ranging from $500 to $1000 within 15 days as per university policy. This financial obligation poses challenges for parents and students, resulting in 20-30% of students being unable to pursue higher education in India despite qualifying for Edoofa Scholarship and securing a seat at their desired university. In response, Edoofa has introduced the Financial Secure Plan to alleviate these constraints and ensure that students can secure their scholarship seats without financial constraints. I hope we are together in this? <This message was edited>
6/2/24, 2:29 PM - +263 77 133 7570: I understood and appreciate the plan. The challenge is for us to pay the fees concurrently we really do have a problem with that.
6/2/24, 2:44 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. In such a case, could you kindly let me know what is a feasible amount for you for the monthly deposits? <This message was edited>
6/2/24, 3:07 PM - +263 77 133 7570: Let me sleep over this and conclude it tomorrow about the amount
6/2/24, 3:24 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. In such a case, let us reconnect tomorrow to further discuss how we can help you with your concern.

Have a blessed day ahead!
