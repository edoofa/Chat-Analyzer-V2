26/1/24, 9:21 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Sarah,

I am *Ms. Siddhi Singh, Admission Officer at Edoofa*. Recently I was having a discussion with the Academic Board. They highlighted  that you have not been able to proceed with your admission process in a timely manner, since your child is at school and you have been occupied with work. Hence, I pitched in that I will be able to help you out and take over your application profile so that together we can ensure a timely and smooth progress. Since my operational hours accommodate your timings more suitably, I will be assuming the duties of your admission officer. I am optimistic that together, we can pave the way for an auspicious beginning to your academic journey, resulting in the right career prospects and eventual success for both you and your family.

I hope you are having a wonderful day. I was hoping to get a response form your end yesterday, but it seems like due to availability issues we were unable to connect with each others. May I know if you are currently available to proceed with our discussion?
2/2/24, 1:30 PM - +27 61 824 8053: Please try highlighting what has to be done. I am on the darkest side of this
2/2/24, 2:02 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. Could you kindly let me know if you are having trouble connecting with us during our scheduled timing i.e., 12:00 PM?

6/2/24, 12:29 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. In our previous conversations, you had highlighted an issue regarding your availability due to work commitments. In reference to that, could you kindly share a timeslot between 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM when it will be suitable for you to have our sessions?
6/2/24, 12:29 PM - +27 61 824 8053: Ok 1:00pm
6/2/24, 12:59 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that. In such a case, we will have our sessions at 1:00 PM from tomorrow onwards. I was going through Sarah's application profile, and it is my understanding that you have successfully completed the 2nd step of the admission cycle i.e., Statement of Purpose. May I know if I am correct?
6/2/24, 1:20 PM - +27 61 824 8053: Yes please.  Very correct
6/2/24, 1:48 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for confirming that. Let us move forward with our discussion. To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is BA LLB  and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2025. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
6/2/24, 2:31 PM - +27 61 824 8053: Very correct and accurate madam
6/2/24, 2:45 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. Based on our experience of over 14 years and having assisted over 5000 students from different countries, we have realized that financial planning is the most important factor when a student plans for their higher education abroad.
6/2/24, 2:45 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am sure that you must be aware that 20-30% of students who are admitted into universities abroad are unable to fulfill their dream and come to India due to a lack of financial planning. The funds needed for booking flights, accommodation, and covering living expenses after arrival often become overwhelming, leading to the decision to defer their admission for a year. This, in turn, creates a gap in the child's education.
6/2/24, 2:45 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: To assist both students and parents in this regard, Edoofa Management has designed a Financial Secure Plan that aims to help you prepare for your higher educational finances without experiencing stress or last-minute rushes. I believe you must be wondering about the details of the same plan and how it helps the parents?
6/2/24, 3:03 PM - +27 61 824 8053: Well noted and l appreciated
6/2/24, 3:23 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Edoofa Secure Plan is important for parents who have children joining the university for tertiary education in the next one to two years for several reasons:
6/2/24, 3:23 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 1. *Financial Preparedness:* The Edoofa Secure plan helps parents prepare financially for the costs after the Scholarship being offered so that they are not caught off guard.

2. *Reduced Financial Stress:* Having the Edoofa Secure Plan in place can significantly reduce the financial stress on you as parents when your child is about to enter university. Knowing that there is a dedicated fund for education expenses provides peace of mind.
6/2/24, 3:23 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 3. *Avoiding Debt*: Without proper savings, some parents may resort to taking out loans or accumulating credit card debt to cover their child's education costs. This Educational savings plan helps avoid the burden of debt and high-interest payments.

4. *Compound Interest:* By starting to save early and consistently contributing to the savings plan, parents can take advantage of compound interest, which can significantly increase the amount available for education expenses.
6/2/24, 3:23 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 5. *Flexibility and Control:* The Edoofa Secure savings plans allow parents to have greater control over their finances and how they allocate funds for their child's education. They can choose investment options that align with their risk tolerance and financial goals.

6. *Encouraging Responsibility*: Involving your child in the process of saving for their education teaches them financial responsibility and the value of higher education. It also motivates them to outperform in Academics.
6/2/24, 3:23 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 7. *Adapting to Unexpected Changes*: Life is full of surprises, and circumstances can change especially when there are political reforms changing each day impacting the Local Currency. Having an Edoofa Secure Plan allows parents to adapt to unexpected changes in their financial situation while still prioritizing their child's education.

8. *Peace of Mind:* Overall, having the Edoofa Secure plan provides parents with peace of mind, knowing that they are actively planning for their child's future and increasing the likelihood of providing them with a solid education.
6/2/24, 3:23 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, when you go through all the above benefits, I am sure you can see that the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan is an important financial tool for parents/students who are supposed to enter the university soon. 

It helps ensure that the financial aspect of tertiary education is well-managed, reduces stress, and allows parents to provide the best opportunities for their children without resorting to debt or financial hardship. Isn't this something you and your family also wish to have?
6/2/24, 5:18 PM - +27 61 824 8053: I read and understand.  This gives me a clear view and can easily raise my child's performances without pulled out of any semester due to financial unavailability.  Thanks for clarifying all. All is now bright in my mind
6/2/24, 5:25 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: You are most welcome. I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through the above points, I will help you understand how the Edoofa Secure Plan works during our next session tomorrow.

On this note, let us conclude our session for today, and we will reconnect tomorrow at our scheduled time to proceed with the discussion about Financial Secure Plan. Have a blessed evening ahead!
6/2/24, 5:27 PM - +27 61 824 8053: Thank your very much. May your wish be successful.
