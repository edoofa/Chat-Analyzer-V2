27/1/24, 4:36 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 1. The admissions group *(Blessing 2K24JAN1895)*  will be the platform where we, as your admission officers, will be communicating with you. This group is dedicated to all-important discussions like your university admission process, offer letter discussion, and ultimately your university registration and reservation of your scholarship along with the Visa process. This group will continue to assist you with your admission-related queries while you are here in India.
27/1/24, 4:36 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 2. Earn While You Learn Program *(Blessing EWYL23E1232)* . In this group, your EWYL mentor, head of the department, and head coach will be present.

This group will keep a record of the tasks and projects you undertake. You will be provided with the link to the group after the completion of the admission process session and on the dedicated date for your EWYL session, where you will be able to directly speak to your EWYL mentor. I hope you are clear about the purpose of the two groups.
27/1/24, 4:39 PM - +263 71 975 2736: Yes mam l am quite clear about all group’s purpose .
27/1/24, 5:10 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to know that you are clear about the purpose of the two WhatsApp groups and it's reassuring to hear this from your end. I also had a recent conversation with your counsellor, during which he provided me with some insights into your academic background and career aspirations. I must commend you as a family, you must take great pride in your achievements and be dedicated to ensuring your access to the finest opportunities to launch your career.

Speaking of valuable opportunities, I am also curious to learn more about your counselling session with your counsellor and to understand which aspects of the Edoofa Scholarship Program have particularly impressed you thus far. Can you share this with me?
27/1/24, 5:20 PM - +263 71 975 2736: The EWYL program impressed me the most . Having the opportunity to be self financed playing a pivotal role in equipping a student to get a first hand professional experience .
27/1/24, 5:31 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your feedback. I am glad to know that you find the program to be so helpful in terms of self-financing. As much as I would like to continue with our conversation today, my operational hours have already concluded and I have had a long day already. Could you kindly suggest a suitable time for you on Monday when we can connect to further discuss your application process?
27/1/24, 5:39 PM - +263 71 975 2736: I will be available starting from 1 o’clock mam .

29/1/24, 12:45 PM - +263 71 975 2736: Good afternoon team .
29/1/24, 1:14 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Blessing. I hope you are all doing well. How has your day been going so far?
29/1/24, 1:17 PM - +263 71 975 2736: It’s a picture perfect of a day .
29/1/24, 1:40 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Moving forward in today's session, we will discuss a bit about your university admission journey. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts. I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them.

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
29/1/24, 1:42 PM - +263 71 975 2736: Yes let’s start .
29/1/24, 2:03 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/1/24, 2:10 PM - +263 71 975 2736: I am done with it .
29/1/24, 2:40 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
29/1/24, 2:40 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
29/1/24, 2:46 PM - +263 71 975 2736: They are very clear and well understood .
29/1/24, 2:56 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps - 

*Step 3: Introduction to the Financial Secure Plan* - Parents with children embarking on their university journey within the next one to two years face important decision-making and rigorous financial planning. Edoofa recognizes the significance of this transition and hence has introduced the Edoofa Secure Plan - a unique and systematic strategy to empower parents in financial planning and preparing for their child's tertiary education well in advance.
29/1/24, 2:56 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Scholarship Offer Letter from the university would be issued next year in the month of August.

I hope you are following?
29/1/24, 3:01 PM - +263 71 975 2736: Yes l am following this very well .
29/1/24, 3:36 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. The registration fee will be paid through the savings you have accumulated visa the Financial Secure Plan. After the registration fee is paid, for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
29/1/24, 3:36 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
29/1/24, 3:54 PM - +263 71 975 2736: They are very clear too .
29/1/24, 4:25 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through all 6 steps, if we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
29/1/24, 4:26 PM - +263 71 975 2736: Yes .
29/1/24, 4:35 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
29/1/24, 4:35 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding. Until you are ready, shall we start with our discussion with me individually? 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
29/1/24, 4:43 PM - +263 71 975 2736: Yes .
29/1/24, 5:20 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/1/24, 5:20 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection. 

Please go through the 4 videos, our next session will be scheduled for tomorrow after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarize your understanding. Hence I would like to know by when do you think you will be able to go through these videos so that we can schedule our next session accordingly?

30/1/24, 3:11 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that. Could you kindly share your understanding of each video individually?
30/1/24, 3:27 PM - +263 71 975 2736: I will summarize that in this video the cofounders of EDOOFA keeps a whole of fame record of successful Edoofians. The most important transition is when a student is handed the scholarship credit form . Students should be open minded and therefore must also follow EDOOFA’S instructions .
30/1/24, 3:42 PM - +263 71 975 2736: The second video was emphasizing on the importance of the Statement of purpose which is designed to market you for a good first impression. EDOOFA contacts the schools , colleges and universities on my behalf which are on their platform . The SOP convinces the admission board that the student is worth the scholarship. I  have to display my skills , strength , vision and achievements in the past of my academic progress and the reason l have chosen the course . After all this the admission team will give you a form immediately and it must be filled fast and a student must be resourceful. I
30/1/24, 3:45 PM - +263 71 975 2736: EDOOFA is to make a students education so affordable. It also guides and also mentor both the student and the parent .

1/2/24, 10:17 AM - +263 71 975 2736: Answering question 2 : 
Electrical Engineers have a significant impact on the world by designing and inventing technologies that have the potential to change how we lie , work , and communicate . Their contributions are essential in various fields , ranging from electronics and telecommunications to renewable energy and medical devices. The impact of Electrical Engineers on the world have played a crucial role in ge development of renewable energy sources like solar , wind and hydro power. Electrical engineers have helped develop the infrastructure required to transmit and distribute electricity to every nook and cranny of home and business . Electrical engineers are responsible for everything , and construction of power lines , substations , and transformers . By using knowledge, skills , and creativity to design , build and maintain system , structure, and technologies that improve our quality of life . From providing clean water and electricity to developing lifesaving medical devices, engineering makes a tangible impact on the world around . With this knowledge l see my country developing through strong communication networks , reliable transformers , mass production of renewable energy sources such as wind and solar and inventing new medical devices .
1/2/24, 10:32 AM - +263 71 975 2736: Answering question 3 :

Their achievement has handed them the three Governance Now PSU IT Awards for the year 2023 . The Governance Now PSU IT Awards are given to honor the efforts and excellence of PSUs in IT .
1/2/24, 11:17 AM - +263 71 975 2736: Answering question 4 : 
Electrical devices convert electrical energy into other forms of energy , for example heat , light or sound . Electronic devices control the flow of electrons in order to perform a task . The term electrical deals with the flow of electrical power or charge , whereas electronics deals with the flow of electrons . There is only a minute difference between electrical and electronics, and both of them more or less deal with electricity. They is also the difference of circuits which can not be ignored . Electric circuit simply powers machines with electricity. However , an electronic circuit can interpret a signal or an instruction and perform a task to suit the circumstances. For example a microwave oven often beeps when it has finished cooking, to inform the user that his or her meal is ready . Electronic and Electrical systems have also differences in maintenance . While electrical engineering is all about generation , transmission, and distribution of power , electronics engineering focuses on the design , development, and maintenance of electronic circuitry used in different types of equipment used in TV , radio , computes e.t.c. .
1/2/24, 11:30 AM - +263 71 975 2736: Answering question 5: 
Unlike the battery , a capacitor is a circuit component that temporarily stores electrical energy through distributing charged particles on ( generally two) plates to create a potential difference. A capacitor can take a shorter time than a battery to charge up and it can release all the energy very quickly. A capacitor works on the principle that the capacitance of a conductor increases appreciably when an earthed conductor is brought near it . Hence , a capacitor has two plates separated by a distance having equal and opposite charges . The purpose of the capacitor are widely used in electronic circuits for blocking direct current while allowing alternating current to pass . In analog filter networks , they smooth the output of power supplies . In resonant circuits they tune radio to particular frequencies. A circuit can work without a capacitor, it depends on what type of circuit you are talking about . If it is an output from a full wave rectifier , and capacitor is not used , you will have a lot of ripples ( voltage fluctuation) . If it is a resonate circuit,  you can’t say that it is resonate if you remove the capacitor.
1/2/24, 11:32 AM - +263 71 975 2736: NB : mam can you confirm if my statement of purpose reflected there . I sent it early morning today .
1/2/24, 12:34 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your answers with me. About the SOP form, I checked for your response, Blessing. However, it seems like your response was not recorded. Could you kindly try and resubmit the form? <This message was edited>
1/2/24, 2:32 PM - +263 71 975 2736: <Media omitted>
1/2/24, 5:07 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your response with me Blessing. Since my operational hours for the day have already concluded, let us reconnect tomorrow at our scheduled time to further proceed with our discussion.

I wish you a blessed night!
1/2/24, 5:53 PM - +263 71 975 2736: NB : l am starting both my EWYL program and orientation tomorrow mam .
2/2/24, 1:33 PM - +263 71 975 2736: Good afternoon team .
2/2/24, 2:26 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Blessing.

I hope you are all doing great today. How has your day been going so far?
2/2/24, 2:27 PM - +263 71 975 2736: We are fine mam thank you for asking .
2/2/24, 2:48 PM - +263 71 975 2736: Mam am l starting my orientation and EWYL program today , we agreed to start on the second of February.
2/2/24, 3:34 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that Blessing. I wish you all the best for your EWYL journey!
2/2/24, 3:36 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: With the completion of the SOP form, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey, i.e. *Introduction to Financial Secure Plan*.
2/2/24, 3:36 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Let us move forward with our discussion. To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is B.Sc (Cardiovascular Technology) and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2025. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
2/2/24, 3:42 PM - +263 71 975 2736: Bachelors Degree in Electrical Engineering , and yes am planning to arrive in August 2025 .
2/2/24, 3:43 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for the confusion. You are planning on pursuing B.Tech (Electronics and Electrical Engineering) and you plan on arriving in India in August 2025. Thank you for confirming that for me. Based on our experience of over 14 years and having assisted over 5000 students from different countries, we have realized that financial planning is the most important factor when a student plans for their higher education abroad.
2/2/24, 3:43 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am sure that you must be aware that 20-30% of students who are admitted into universities abroad are unable to fulfill their dream and come to India due to a lack of financial planning. The funds needed for booking flights, accommodation, and covering living expenses after arrival often become overwhelming, leading to the decision to defer their admission for a year. This, in turn, creates a gap in the child's education.
2/2/24, 3:43 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: To assist both students and parents in this regard, Edoofa Management has designed a Financial Secure Plan that aims to help you prepare for your higher educational finances without experiencing stress or last-minute rushes. I believe you must be wondering about the details of the same plan and how it helps the parents?
2/2/24, 3:46 PM - +263 71 975 2736: Yes mam , can you explain more to me .
2/2/24, 4:18 PM - +263 71 975 2736: When is it beginning mam .
2/2/24, 5:01 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for the confusion Blessing. Allow me to share the information with you.
2/2/24, 5:02 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: As promised, now that you are a part of the Edoofa Journey, the opportunity to help you self-fund your higher education and for you to be industry-ready s here, and in light of the same, I would like to assist you in getting started with your EWYL Journey. Based on your EWYL application form, you are scheduled to commence your EWYL journey on Friday (2 February 2024).
2/2/24, 5:02 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: With your intention and commencement date in mind, we have already communicated this information to the EWYL team. They are prepared to initiate your EWYL program on Friday, as previously agreed upon.

To kick start the process, your dedicated EWYL Mentor has established your EWYL Group and shared the invitation link with us. Here's what you and your parents/guardian/sponsor need to do:
2/2/24, 5:03 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: https://chat.whatsapp.com/JEx6KxYnoxFLebwcQZygUW

Blessing EWYL23E1232
2/2/24, 5:03 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Use the above-provided link to join your group. Once both you and your parents have joined, please send the following message to the group:

*Dear Mentor, my name is Blessing Ndudzo, and my EWYL group name is Blessing EWYL23E1232. I am excited to begin my EWYL Journey.

Kindly schedule my session for the same date so that I can maximize the benefits and start on the right track.*
2/2/24, 5:03 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Once you start with the EWYL Program and are able to connect with your mentor, please update the same here as well by sending the below message -

*Hello Admission officer, I am now in touch with my EWYL Mentor. The name of my Mentor is* _________ *and he/she has scheduled my session for* ________ (mention the date)
3/2/24, 9:57 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Blessing. How are you all doing this fine morning?
3/2/24, 9:57 AM - +263 71 975 2736: We are doing fine mam , l haven’t heard from my EWYL mentor yet .
3/2/24, 10:24 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. I will let them know about the same. In the meanwhile, kindly share the message on the group again, in case there was some technical error and they did not receive your message.
3/2/24, 10:27 AM - +263 71 975 2736: Ok will kindly send it again .
3/2/24, 10:39 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that Blessing. During our previous interaction, I was sharing how the Financial Secure Plan is going to be beneficial for you. Edoofa Secure Plan is important for parents who have children joining the university for tertiary education in the next one to two years for several reasons:
3/2/24, 10:39 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: 1. *Financial Preparedness:* The Edoofa Secure plan helps parents prepare financially for the costs after the Scholarship being offered so that they are not caught off guard.

2. *Reduced Financial Stress:* Having the Edoofa Secure Plan in place can significantly reduce the financial stress on you as parents when your child is about to enter university. Knowing that there is a dedicated fund for education expenses provides peace of mind.
3/2/24, 10:39 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: 3. *Avoiding Debt*: Without proper savings, some parents may resort to taking out loans or accumulating credit card debt to cover their child's education costs. This Educational savings plan helps avoid the burden of debt and high-interest payments.

4. *Compound Interest:* By starting to save early and consistently contributing to the savings plan, parents can take advantage of compound interest, which can significantly increase the amount available for education expenses.
3/2/24, 10:39 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: 5. *Flexibility and Control:* The Edoofa Secure savings plans allow parents to have greater control over their finances and how they allocate funds for their child's education. They can choose investment options that align with their risk tolerance and financial goals.

6. *Encouraging Responsibility*: Involving your child in the process of saving for their education teaches them financial responsibility and the value of higher education. It also motivates them to outperform in Academics.
3/2/24, 10:39 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: 7. *Adapting to Unexpected Changes*: Life is full of surprises, and circumstances can change especially when there are political reforms changing each day impacting the Local Currency. Having an Edoofa Secure Plan allows parents to adapt to unexpected changes in their financial situation while still prioritizing their child's education.

8. *Peace of Mind:* Overall, having the Edoofa Secure plan provides parents with peace of mind, knowing that they are actively planning for their child's future and increasing the likelihood of providing them with a solid education.
3/2/24, 10:40 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, when you go through all the above benefits, I am sure you can see that the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan is an important financial tool for parents/students who are supposed to enter the university soon. 

It helps ensure that the financial aspect of tertiary education is well-managed, reduces stress, and allows parents to provide the best opportunities for their children without resorting to debt or financial hardship. Isn't this something you and your family also wish to have?
3/2/24, 11:01 AM - +263 71 975 2736: This message was deleted
3/2/24, 11:02 AM - +263 71 975 2736: We also with the same mam .
3/2/24, 11:07 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through the above points, do you want me to help you understand how the Edoofa Secure Plan works?
3/2/24, 11:08 AM - +263 71 975 2736: Yes explain further .
3/2/24, 11:14 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, as you are aware, we are currently in February 2024, and we have a good 20 months to plan for your finances before you start your university education in 2025.
3/2/24, 11:15 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: During the counseling session, you were informed that at Edoofa, we guarantee a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship on the tuition fees. Hence, the cost of education, including food and accommodation after the scholarship, would be between $2000-$3000, and it could be even less. Not more than that.
3/2/24, 11:15 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: This means that if you can save $150 per month for the next 20 months, you will be able to save $3000. This amount is more than enough for the first year of university fees, including tuition fees (if any), food, and accommodation. I hope you agree with this?
3/2/24, 11:23 AM - +263 71 975 2736: Yes mam , l am very honored to know this .
3/2/24, 11:29 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Right, this means that by the time you would be in India, you would have already saved the $3000 that will cover the first-year fee.
3/2/24, 11:29 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, in these next 20 months, I am sure you would also be engaged in the EWYL program, and if you secure a minimum of $1000 in 20 months, that means the fees for 1.5 years are already secured.
3/2/24, 11:30 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, for a 3-year course, if we follow the same approach for the remaining 1.5 years, the educational journey for the student and the financial journey for the parent will be easy and smooth. I believe you must be able to see this perspective?
3/2/24, 11:31 AM - +263 71 975 2736: I am seeing this perspective quite clear .
3/2/24, 11:34 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. With that said, there is also another benefit, I am sure being in Zimbabwe you know how drastically the exchange rate fluctuates.
3/2/24, 11:34 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: If you are buying a dollar today, you might be spending 7000 bonds, but if you buy a dollar after a month, the rate would be different.
3/2/24, 11:34 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Also, even if you choose to buy dollars every month and save at your home, it is not safe since there is news of robbery, and mugging every day.
3/2/24, 11:34 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: In that case, you will opt to save in the Bank, but again we know that savings in the Bank require a Nostro Account which means you have to pay the bank to keep your money safe, right?
3/2/24, 11:36 AM - +263 71 975 2736: Yes mam .
3/2/24, 11:49 AM - +263 71 975 2736: Just a quick question mam , isn’t electrical engineering four years .
3/2/24, 12:03 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is correct indeed. Hence, in your case, for a 4-year course, we will have to follow the same approach and ensure that we are consistent with our planning and savings so that the financial journey is easy and smooth.
3/2/24, 12:04 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is great to hear. Considering these constraints, Edoofa Management has decided to help the parents and students prepare for the journey way ahead of time by helping them save money with Edoofa without any additional charges but rather saving additional money as well. Do you want me to explain how this has been achieved?
3/2/24, 12:16 PM - +263 71 975 2736: Yes please .
3/2/24, 12:44 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Program Fee (Enrollment Fee) that you were asked to pay is $350. Under the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan, a parent has to deposit a small amount of money which is $150 every month for the next 10 months. That means, in 10 months, the money saved will be $1500. <This message was edited>
3/2/24, 12:44 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That means, in 10 months, the money saved will be $1500. When this money is saved, Edoofa will waive off $150 from the Edoofa Program/Enrollment Fee of $350, thereby making a straight saving of $150 in 10 months.
3/2/24, 12:44 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Imagine you paying $15 every month to the Bank of Zimbabwe to keep your money safe, and here Edoofa is paying you $15 every month to keep your money safe. Now, you must be wondering, why only for 10 months and not for 20 months, right?
3/2/24, 12:47 PM - +263 71 975 2736: Yes l am .
3/2/24, 12:47 PM - +263 71 975 2736: I already paid $200 towards the enrollment fee and am left with $150 .
3/2/24, 12:48 PM - +263 71 975 2736: Which is going to be paid very soon .
3/2/24, 1:10 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. By being a part of the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan, your remaining amount of $150 will be waived off, and you will be able to make a saving of $150 straight!
3/2/24, 1:11 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Continuing our previous conversation, if you see the bigger picture, you will realize that the reason is quite simple. Upon the completion of the 10 installments, the Edoofa Admissions team will initiate the Child’s Admission Process by applying early to the universities to secure their scholarship and their university seat.
3/2/24, 1:11 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Reserving seats earlier increases the chances of obtaining a maximum scholarship. A higher scholarship means lower fees, and by securing the seat, you will be entitled to pay the fees as per the old fee structure of the university, not the new one implemented in January 2025. Furthermore, when applying to the universities, you will receive an offer letter or a letter of intent detailing the fees, scholarship, and registration fees.
3/2/24, 1:11 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: As explained during the enrollment process, the registration fee is a portion of your first-year university fee, paid to reserve the seat. It ranges from $500-$1000 and is not an additional fee. 

From the $1500 you saved with Edoofa, the registration fee will be paid to the university, securing the seat. For instance, if the registration fee is $1000, Edoofa will pay $1000 from the $1500 saved in 10 months. The updated balance with Edoofa will be $500, which will be paid to the university upon your arrival in India.
3/2/24, 1:11 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This eases the financial burden on the parent, as there is no immediate payment required upon the student's arrival. The $500 saved will cover the remaining fees for the semester/year, as specified in the offer letter from the university. What are your thoughts on this?
3/2/24, 1:16 PM - +263 71 975 2736: I am loving this plan , it is professional.
3/2/24, 1:18 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that, Blessing. With this plan for the next 10 months, I am sure you must be wondering what will happen in the next 10 months, considering you have already secured your scholarship seat with the university due to your hard work in the first 10 months. Is my understanding correct?
3/2/24, 1:30 PM - +263 71 975 2736: Yes it is .
3/2/24, 1:37 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. I would love to continue with our discussion, however my operating hours on Saturdays end at 1:00 PM. Hence, let us conclude our conversation for today and we will reconnect on Monday for our next session.

I wish you and your family a blessed weekend ahead!
3/2/24, 1:38 PM - +263 71 975 2736: Same to you mam .
5/2/24, 1:35 PM - +263 71 975 2736: Good afternoon team .
