With great excitement and pride, I want to share that over the past few days, the Edoofa team has been immersed in an exciting event we had in store for our students. Edoofa hosted a conference - the Symposium of Leaders, Innovators, and Creators at Edoofa, also known as 'SLICE-CON.'

The conference was attended by all the Edoofians of 2023 and a few senior Edoofians from previous batches. It focused on the art of creation, innovation, and, most importantly, the mindset required to make an impact in one's career. <This message was edited>
12/1/24, 12:55 PM - Dev Edoofa: During this Industrial Visit and the conference - SLICE CON, Corporate leaders, such as the CEOs and Co-founders from renowned companies like Rage Coffee, Sirona Hygiene, Jolin New York, and more, shared their insights and experience. These individuals are at the helm of multi-millionaire brands, leading large marketing teams. Their presence added immense value, providing students with the opportunity to engage in transformative conversations.
12/1/24, 12:55 PM - Dev Edoofa: We believe that interactions with such industry leaders can bring significant transformations to students' lives, enhancing their business acumen. Our Edoofians maximized this opportunity, having life-changing conversations with these influential figures. The main objective of the event was to emphasize the importance of thinking outside the box, and encouraging students to believe in themselves and their dreams. Before we start our session today, I wanted to share a glimpse of the event, and I hope you are excited to attend similar events when you come to India.
12/1/24, 12:56 PM - Dev Edoofa: <Media omitted>

12/1/24, 1:22 PM - +260 97 9151577: yes please
12/1/24, 1:22 PM - Dev Edoofa: Great! Moving forward in our today’s session, we will discuss a bit about your university admission journey. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts. I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them.

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
12/1/24, 1:23 PM - +260 97 9151577: sure thing
12/1/24, 1:26 PM - Dev Edoofa: <Media omitted>
12/1/24, 1:27 PM - +260 97 9151577: I'm done
12/1/24, 2:00 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
12/1/24, 2:00 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
12/1/24, 2:03 PM - +260 97 9151577: yes sir
12/1/24, 2:06 PM - Dev Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
12/1/24, 2:06 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
12/1/24, 2:09 PM - +260 97 9151577: are these sessions daily ?
12/1/24, 2:09 PM - +260 97 9151577: yes I am
12/1/24, 2:11 PM - Dev Edoofa: These sessions are not going to be daily but for just a couple of days.
12/1/24, 2:11 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process, the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
12/1/24, 2:11 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
12/1/24, 2:13 PM - +260 97 9151577: yes sir
12/1/24, 2:15 PM - Dev Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
12/1/24, 2:15 PM - +260 97 9151577: yes sir
12/1/24, 2:15 PM - Dev Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
12/1/24, 2:15 PM - Dev Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding until you are ready, shall we start with our discussion with me individually? 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
12/1/24, 2:18 PM - +260 97 9151577: yes please
12/1/24, 2:21 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students*

This is a video by the founders of EDOOFA, in which they share 2 important qualities of successful Edoofians- who've secured a maximum scholarship and earned scholarship credits.

2.A right is an entitlement a person is born with these entitlements are inalienable, universal and indivisible. A right is sanctioned by the government to protect the interests of the people and also against ill-treatment and inequality. Examples of such right are the right to life, privacy, voting, etc. some rights, however, are not protected by law or even sanctioned by the government, rights like self-determination (collective rights). Rights like Civil and Political rights are quite the opposite and can be defended in the courts of law.
Whereas duties are given to individuals that have proven responsible enough to take the task assigned to them, usually by in higher offices or elderly people. They are usually overseen by the people that assigns the duty they are also regarded as obligations one has to fulfil. In a case of an organisation it’s the duty of the company clerk to organise meetings, this role is usually over seen and tasked by their higher offices.
3. An attorney by definition is a person(lawyer) appointed to act on behalf of someone or company concerning legal matters. The attorney has to be admitted to the bar before he is able to represent someone in the courts of law concerning any legal matters. He/she is able to advise people on any legal matter and defend them in any aspect of, law be it corporate, civil and criminal cases. They work individually to gather evidence and necessary documents for their defence.
Whereas a prosecutor by definition is a person, public official who institutes legal proceedings against someone. He is in charge of all criminal proceedings and represents the government, he also brings defendants in criminal cases to justice in the name of the state/ the crown. A Prosecutor can only defend the government and only in criminal cases. The prosecutor works in conjunction with the police and other governmental entities that work to his favour.
4.Corporate law.
I want to be involved actively in the building and upholding of companies and organisations, in turn I will know the building blocks of the company and l, one day, will be able to start my own company with the knowledge I will acquire. I would like to see organisations grow and reach greater heights with the contributions I make to the decisions, help like give advice on partnerships and making deals that benefit both parties. I want to be able to help and control interaction within the company and between the company and the people. By putting up policies and agreements to protect the interests of the company and the people. I want to one day make deals with big companies and protect the interest of the people and the company as I make those deals. Also I want to ensure compliancy, organisation and navigate the laws that govern the does and don’ts of the company.  
 5.My organisation skills are quite a skill because I can be able to organise my work and work around me making work a lot easier to navigate. I have okay social skills that can help me work with anyone, these social skills I believe can help make good negotiations and deals, convincing people with factual information. Example, I am able to talk to any type of people and understand their point of view.  I believe my creativity caters as a skill that can help me make new and innovative agreements that benefit all parties. I am able to analyse and understand situations effectively giving the ability to make decision not based on emotion. With due time I believe my skills will develop in accordance to my course and more skills will be learnt and developed.

5/2/24, 4:54 PM - +260 97 9151577: I'm kindly asking for the form the co founders talked of
5/2/24, 6:06 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the insights with us dear, Let me also add to each video that you watched and help you summarize a few additional insights:
5/2/24, 6:07 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 1: Important Message for Enrolled Students*

The first video underscores the importance of two crucial qualities: open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions. Edoofa's vision for its students is to foster success in their careers, and promote responsibility, and independence. A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.
5/2/24, 6:07 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s Vision for You*

Edoofa's vision for its students is to provide them with employment opportunities and the skills necessary to become future leaders. The program places students above other candidates by investing significant time and effort into finding reputable, education-focused institutions rather than solely business-oriented ones.
5/2/24, 6:07 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

In the third video, it is highlighted that Edoofa's founders have dedicated over a decade to meticulously identify reputable educational institutions. Students are advised to cultivate the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to excel in the job market. All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to student's career goals.
5/2/24, 6:07 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools. It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.
5/2/24, 6:07 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In summary, these videos emphasize the significance of qualities such as open-mindedness, following instructions, and cooperation. Edoofa's vision is to empower students for successful careers and leadership roles by carefully selecting educational institutions. The SOP is a vital tool for effective communication and admission success. 

I hope you agree with all of this and were able to understand these by watching the four videos?
5/2/24, 6:14 PM - +260 97 9151577: yes I was,thank you
5/2/24, 6:16 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Brilliant, Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
5/2/24, 6:19 PM - +260 97 9151577: yes,yes we are
5/2/24, 6:22 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by tomorrow 12:30 PM.
5/2/24, 6:22 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded.

6/2/24, 12:44 PM - +260 97 9151577: *Answer's*  
2.A right is an entitlement a person is born with these entitlements are inalienable, universal and indivisible. A right is sanctioned by the government to protect the interests of the people and also against ill-treatment and inequality. Examples of such right are the right to life, privacy, voting, etc. some rights, however, are not protected by law or even sanctioned by the government, rights like self-determination (collective rights). Rights like Civil and Political rights are quite the opposite and can be defended in the courts of law.
Whereas duties are given to individuals that have proven responsible enough to take the task assigned to them, usually by in higher offices or elderly people. They are usually overseen by the people that assigns the duty they are also regarded as obligations one has to fulfil. In a case of an organisation it’s the duty of the company clerk to organise meetings, this role is usually over seen and tasked by their higher offices.
3. An attorney by definition is a person(lawyer) appointed to act on behalf of someone or company concerning legal matters. The attorney has to be admitted to the bar before he is able to represent someone in the courts of law concerning any legal matters. He/she is able to advise people on any legal matter and defend them in any aspect of, law be it corporate, civil and criminal cases. They work individually to gather evidence and necessary documents for their defence.
Whereas a prosecutor by definition is a person, public official who institutes legal proceedings against someone. He is in charge of all criminal proceedings and represents the government, he also brings defendants in criminal cases to justice in the name of the state/ the crown. A Prosecutor can only defend the government and only in criminal cases. The prosecutor works in conjunction with the police and other governmental entities that work to his favour.
4.Corporate law.
I want to be involved actively in the building and upholding of companies and organisations, in turn I will know the building blocks of the company and l, one day, will be able to start my own company with the knowledge I will acquire. I would like to see organisations grow and reach greater heights with the contributions I make to the decisions, help like give advice on partnerships and making deals that benefit both parties. I want to be able to help and control interaction within the company and between the company and the people. By putting up policies and agreements to protect the interests of the company and the people. I want to one day make deals with big companies and protect the interest of the people and the company as I make those deals. Also I want to ensure compliancy, organisation and navigate the laws that govern the does and don’ts of the company.  
 5.My organisation skills are quite a skill because I can be able to organise my work and work around me making work a lot easier to navigate. I have okay social skills that can help me work with anyone, these social skills I believe can help make good negotiations and deals, convincing people with factual information. Example, I am able to talk to any type of people and understand their point of view.  I believe my creativity caters as a skill that can help me make new and innovative agreements that benefit all parties. I am able to analyse and understand situations effectively giving the ability to make decision not based on emotion. With due time I believe my skills will develop in accordance to my course and more skills will be learnt and developed.

6/2/24, 1:19 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your response regarding the SOP form and academic questions.  With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey.
6/2/24, 1:20 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Before we proceed to the next stage, I'd like to assist you in getting started with your EWYL Journey. Based on your EWYL application form, you are scheduled to commence your EWYL journey on Friday (16-Feb-2024).
6/2/24, 1:20 PM - Ashi Edoofa: With your intention and commencement date in mind, we have already communicated this information to the EWYL team. They are prepared to initiate your EWYL program on Friday, as previously agreed upon.

To kickstart the process, your dedicated EWYL Mentor has established your EWYL Group and shared the invitation link with us. Here's what you and your parents/guardian/sponsor need to do:

https://chat.whatsapp.com/HI4zJsSt5n39abLfr0RTpf
6/2/24, 1:21 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Use the provided link to join your group. Once both you and your parents have joined, please send the following message to the group:

*Dear Mentor, my name is Ntali Chapeshamano, and my EWYL group name is Ntali EWYL23E1162. I am excited to begin my EWYL Journey. As discussed with the admission team, I am committed to being available on  Friday (16-Feb-2024) to commence the procedures. Kindly schedule my session for the same date so that I can maximize the benefits and start on the right track.*
6/2/24, 1:21 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Once you start with the EWYL Program and are able to connect with your mentor, please update the same here as well by sending the below message -

*Hello Admission officer, I am now in touch with my EWYL Mentor. The name of my Mentor is _________ and he/she has scheduled my session for ________*(mention the date)
6/2/24, 2:04 PM - +260 95 5956785: Noted
6/2/24, 2:06 PM - Ashi Edoofa: With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey. we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*.
6/2/24, 2:06 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In the meantime, let us move forward with our discussion. To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is *BA LLB* and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
6/2/24, 2:13 PM - +260 95 5956785: Yes that's correct
6/2/24, 2:14 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for the confirmation. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
6/2/24, 2:14 PM - Ashi Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
6/2/24, 2:14 PM - Ashi Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
6/2/24, 2:14 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
6/2/24, 2:23 PM - +260 95 5956785: Definitely not...
6/2/24, 2:25 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
6/2/24, 2:25 PM - Ashi Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $1000. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
6/2/24, 2:25 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
6/2/24, 2:33 PM - +260 97 9151577: yes
6/2/24, 2:34 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $1200 to $1800 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
6/2/24, 2:45 PM - +260 97 9151577: Hello Admission officer, I am now in touch with my EWYL Mentor. The name of my Mentor is Ms.Aditi and he/she has scheduled my session for 16th February 2024.
6/2/24, 2:46 PM - Ashi Edoofa: It's wonderful to hear that you've connected with your EWYL Mentor, Ms. Aditi, and that a session has been scheduled for 16th of February. This is a significant step in your journey, and I want to express my heartfelt congratulations to you for taking this initiative.

Wishing you all the best as you begin this exciting chapter. May it be filled with learning, personal growth, and, above all, a genuine sense of accomplishment.
6/2/24, 2:47 PM - +260 97 9151577: thank you madam
6/2/24, 2:50 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Welcome dear, Have you gone through my above message ?
6/2/24, 2:51 PM - +260 97 9151577: yes
6/2/24, 2:54 PM - +260 95 5956785: Ms Ashi do these amounts $1200 and $1800 come before or after scholarship?
6/2/24, 2:57 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Correct, The cost of education is reduced from $6000-$8000 to $2000-$3000 per annum which includes Tuition fee, Accommodation, Food, Wifi, Laundry, Library, Gym fee, etc!
 
This cost can be further reduced through the earnings from Earn While You Learn program. Moreover, the actual scholarship percentage will be shared with you once you will receive the offer letter from the university
6/2/24, 2:59 PM - +260 95 5956785: Thank so much for the response which is now loud and clear.
6/2/24, 3:03 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Most welcome @260955956785
6/2/24, 3:03 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:
1. *Tuition Fee*: $650 per annum
2. *Accommodation Fee*: $0 per annum (100% Sponsorship)
3. *Remaining Fee Components*: [Library Fee, Examination Fee, EDB and Book Bank, International Student Development Fund, 24-Hour WiFi Cost, Maintenance Fee, Water Bill, and Electricity Bill]: $1000 per annum

*Total Fee: Tuition Fee $650 + Accommodation Fee $0 + Remaining Fee Components $1000 = $1650 per annum.*
6/2/24, 3:03 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Registration Fee to be paid: $1000 (deadline within two weeks of issue of the offer letter, part of the university’s first-year fee and will be adjusted against the first-year cost of education $1650). I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?
6/2/24, 4:56 PM - +260 95 5956785: Yes I have...
6/2/24, 6:18 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $1000, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $1000 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $1650 as per the above example.
6/2/24, 6:18 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $1650 - $1000 = $650 . This amount can be paid in two installments of $325 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $325 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
6/2/24, 8:28 PM - +260 95 5956785: How long do the universities take to respond to the applications once you submit?
6/2/24, 8:31 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Usually it takes 4 - 5 days dear
6/2/24, 8:31 PM - Ashi Edoofa: As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
6/2/24, 8:31 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
6/2/24, 8:31 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
6/2/24, 8:47 PM - +260 95 5956785: I see.  So when exactly are you "EDOOFA" likely to submit.  Im asking so because of planning purposes.  I would be grateful it only it can be ready starting march going into april.
6/2/24, 8:48 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Well, We are planning to submit your application soon after you will share the remaining document with us.
6/2/24, 8:48 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
6/2/24, 8:51 PM - +260 95 5956785: Great
6/2/24, 8:51 PM - +260 95 5956785: All is clear now
6/2/24, 8:53 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright please, Now with this, we are done with step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
6/2/24, 8:53 PM - Ashi Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one.
6/2/24, 8:53 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
6/2/24, 8:54 PM - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
6/2/24, 9:09 PM - +260 95 5956785: We're anxiously waiting to receive the offer letter from the university
6/2/24, 9:12 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Yes, indeed. The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
6/2/24, 9:12 PM - Ashi Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received special news for the students of the 2024 admission intake. May I know if you are excited to know the news we have for you?
6/2/24, 9:17 PM - +260 95 5956785: I can't wait to hear this exciting news that you have.....
6/2/24, 9:17 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am happy to see that you are excited. After speaking with thousands of students and parents who completed their admission process before you, we realized that the current economic situation in African countries makes it a bit challenging for parents to pay the full registration fee at once. 

In response to the same challenge, we had a detailed discussion with the academic board and university official. As a result, we developed a solution to alleviate the financial burden of the parents specifically for the registration fee due of $500 to $1000.
6/2/24, 9:18 PM - Ashi Edoofa: We at Edoofa are thrilled about this development, and I believe it will significantly help all of our students and their families. Are you aware of the solution?
6/2/24, 9:22 PM - +260 95 5956785: No I'm not, what is the solution
6/2/24, 9:23 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That is alright, let me share the same. With respect to the conversation we had with the academic board and the university officials, we requested them to allow the students to make the payment of their registration fee in two parts within a span of 45 days thereby reducing the financial pressure.
6/2/24, 9:23 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Here's how it works: Consider that your registration fee is $1000. After you will receive the offer letter, the first part of the registration fees which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, i.e. $500 needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university (For most of the universities 15 days). Subsequently, the second part of $500, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
6/2/24, 9:23 PM - Ashi Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for February 15, 2024, and your registration fee stands at $1000, you'll need to make a payment of $500 on or before February 15, 2024. The remaining $500 should be paid by March 15, 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
