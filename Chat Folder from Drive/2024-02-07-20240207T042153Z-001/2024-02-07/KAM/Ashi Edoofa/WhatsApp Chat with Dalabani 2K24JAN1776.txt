If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
30/1/24, 6:06 PM - +263 78 878 7885: Yes please
30/1/24, 6:10 PM - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
30/1/24, 6:11 PM - +263 78 878 7885: Done
30/1/24, 6:11 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -
30/1/24, 6:11 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
30/1/24, 6:12 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.
30/1/24, 6:12 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I hope these two steps are clear?
30/1/24, 6:13 PM - +263 78 878 7885: Yes ma'am
30/1/24, 6:18 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps-
30/1/24, 6:18 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
30/1/24, 6:18 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.
30/1/24, 6:18 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I hope you are following?
30/1/24, 6:22 PM - +263 78 878 7885: All clear ma'am, please proceed
30/1/24, 6:23 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps-
30/1/24, 6:23 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of *$500 to $1000.* Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
30/1/24, 6:24 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.
30/1/24, 6:24 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I hope these are clear as well?
30/1/24, 6:28 PM - +263 78 878 7885: They are
30/1/24, 6:30 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for the further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
30/1/24, 6:31 PM - +263 78 878 7885: Yes please
30/1/24, 6:32 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
30/1/24, 6:32 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually. 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention.

31/1/24, 4:58 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am pleased to know that you were able to go through all the videos. If you don't mind, could you please share your understanding of all four videos with me so that I can assist you in expanding upon them and help you ensure you are on the right path in your educational journey?
31/1/24, 5:05 PM - +263 78 878 7885: <Media omitted>
31/1/24, 5:07 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That is correct. Let me also add to each video that you watched and help you summarize a few additional insights:
31/1/24, 5:07 PM - +263 78 878 7885: Sure
31/1/24, 5:07 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 1: Important Message for Enrolled Students*

The first video underscores the importance of two crucial qualities: open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions. Edoofa's vision for its students is to foster success in their careers, and promote responsibility, and independence. A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.
31/1/24, 5:08 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s Vision for You*

Edoofa's vision for its students is to provide them with employment opportunities and the skills necessary to become future leaders. The program places students above other candidates by investing significant time and effort into finding reputable, education-focused institutions rather than solely business-oriented ones.
31/1/24, 5:08 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

In the third video, it is highlighted that Edoofa's founders have dedicated over a decade to meticulously identify reputable educational institutions. Students are advised to cultivate the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to excel in the job market. All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to student's career goals.
31/1/24, 5:08 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools. It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.
31/1/24, 5:08 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In summary, these videos emphasize the significance of qualities such as open-mindedness, following instructions, and cooperation. Edoofa's vision is to empower students for successful careers and leadership roles by carefully selecting educational institutions. The SOP is a vital tool for effective communication and admission success. 

I hope you agree with all of this and were able to understand these by watching the four videos?
31/1/24, 5:11 PM - +263 78 878 7885: Yes ma'am
31/1/24, 5:16 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Brilliant, Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
31/1/24, 5:17 PM - +263 78 878 7885: Yes we are
31/1/24, 5:20 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by tomorrow 12:30 PM.
31/1/24, 5:20 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded.

Could you kindly confirm when you will be able to complete these tasks and reconnect with us? This will allow us to schedule our discussion accordingly.
31/1/24, 5:32 PM - +263 78 878 7885: By 12:30PM tomorrow ma'am
31/1/24, 5:35 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That is wonderful to hear. In that case, we will be concluding the conversation for now and we will reconnect tomorrow at 12:30 pm for our next session. 

I hope by then you will be able to fill out all the forms. If you have any queries or concerns before then, feel free to share them here in your admission group. Wish you a blessed day and please ensure to extend our regards to your family as well.

In terms of its development my country, Zimbabwe, has indeed come a long way and still has a long way to go, from the building of bridges, roads and other infrastructure, to the development in technology. 

I believe that Zimbabwe has  great potential to grow economically and to improve the living standards within. This is because Zimbabwe's economy has attracted many different nationalities  due to its natural wonders, for example. 

However, Zimbabwe faces setbacks. It has debts to IFIs ( International Financial Institutions), increasing rate of inflation, high dependence on agricultural produce which is sometimes low and poor electricity generation. So now as an engineer , by working in industries such as the agricultural, renewable energy  or electricity supply industries I could help design and improve sustainable energy systems , better improve generation, transmission and distribution of electricity which will help the country as a whole.
1/2/24, 12:15 PM - +263 78 878 7885: A3:
My dream company is SEC, The Saudi Electricity Company, based in Saudi Arabia. It is responsible for generating, transmitting and distributing electricity in Saudi Arabia and is also working to produce renewable energy sources.

I would like to work at SEC because it has a very professional culture, encourages respect, values innovation and challenges employees to be creative . It also offers competitive salaries. I would also like to work there because SEC is based in an Islamic state which will provide an environment that is convenient to me as Islam is my religion. 

However, as it is only wise to have more options in one's pocket, I have also taken a look at Azure Power which us a company based in India and is attractive because of uts string ficus on environmental sustainability. It is one of the leading solar energy providers in India.

I would also love to come back home and help develop the country while working in companies such as Sengwa Renewable Energy.

Electronic system are designed to process electrical signals and  they run on electricity. These systems are made up of electronic components such as a diode, which is a device that allows the flow of electric current in only one direction. The Electronic components, like the diode, manipulate the flow of electricity to perform specific functions. Electronic systems manipulate the flow of electricity to perform specific tasks such as that of a computer which has a circuitry that manipulates the flow of electricity to perform calculations and other functions. 

Electrical systems on the other hand deal with the flow of electrical power and are made up of electrical components such as wires and alternators that carry and control the flow of electric current. These systems consist of all the elements needed to distribute electrical power. 

In summary, Electronic systems focus on devices that run on electricity whereas electrical systems focus on the use of electricity as an energy source.
1/2/24, 12:32 PM - +263 78 878 7885: A5:
A Capacitor is an electrical device that can store energy in the form of electric charge. It is made up of two metal plates that are separated by a dielectric which acts as an insulator. 

So if a battery is connected to the two metal plates of the capacitor, a current will try to flow but because of the dielectric the electrons will not be able to pass through the capacitor and will thus start to accumulate on the plate until the battery  has insufficient energy to keep pushing electrons to the plate because of the repulsive force between the positive electrons. At this point, the capacitor will be fully charged and if the battery is removed the capacitor will hold the electric charge for a long time as energy. If a load is connected, the capacitor will discharge.

Capacitors are used to filter out noise in electrical systems and also for large scale corrective work in large scale industries.
1/2/24, 12:32 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your response regarding the SOP form and academic questions.  With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey.
1/2/24, 12:32 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Before we proceed to the next stage, I'd like to assist you in getting started with your EWYL Journey. Based on your EWYL application form, you are scheduled to commence your EWYL journey on Tuesday (06-Feb-2024).
1/2/24, 12:33 PM - Ashi Edoofa: With your intention and commencement date in mind, we have already communicated this information to the EWYL team. They are prepared to initiate your EWYL program on Tuesday, as previously agreed upon.

To kickstart the process, your dedicated EWYL Mentor has established your EWYL Group and shared the invitation link with us. Here's what you and your parents/guardian/sponsor need to do:

https://chat.whatsapp.com/E764kipLYBg8nvjaL8wt9z
1/2/24, 12:33 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Use the provided link to join your group. Once both you and your parents have joined, please send the following message to the group:

*Dear Mentor, my name is Dalabani Walid, and my EWYL group name is Dalabani EWYL23E1241 I am excited to begin my EWYL Journey.

Kindly schedule my session for the same date so that I can maximize the benefits and start on the right track.*
1/2/24, 12:33 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Once you start with the EWYL Program and are able to connect with your mentor, please update the same here as well by sending the below message -

*Hello Admission officer, I am now in touch with my EWYL Mentor. The name of my Mentor is _________ and he/she has scheduled my session for ________*(mention the date)
1/2/24, 12:35 PM - +263 78 878 7885: Okay ma'am
1/2/24, 12:35 PM - +263 78 878 7885: Thank you
1/2/24, 12:40 PM - Ashi Edoofa: You are welcome dear, With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey. we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*.
1/2/24, 12:41 PM - Ashi Edoofa: However, before we do the same, I was going through your scholarship application file and noticed that you are supposed to make the payment of your remaining part of Edoofa Enrollment fee before 24th February, 2024. Hence, I thought of sharing a gentle reminder with you and try to understand how your preparation has been so far? Have you been able to align your preparations in the right direction?
1/2/24, 12:44 PM - +263 78 878 7885: Preparations are going well and we are hoping to make the payment before dealine
1/2/24, 12:53 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. We will reconnect with each other a few days before your due date to take a follow up on this and understand your preparations better.
1/2/24, 12:54 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In the meantime, let us move forward with our discussion. To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is *B.Tech (Electronics and Electrical Engineering)* and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
1/2/24, 12:56 PM - +263 78 878 7885: Correct
1/2/24, 1:01 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
1/2/24, 1:01 PM - Ashi Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
1/2/24, 1:02 PM - Ashi Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
1/2/24, 1:02 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
1/2/24, 1:03 PM - +263 78 878 7885: Right
1/2/24, 1:03 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
1/2/24, 1:03 PM - Ashi Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $1000. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
1/2/24, 1:03 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
1/2/24, 1:05 PM - +263 78 878 7885: Yes he did
1/2/24, 1:06 PM - +263 78 878 7885: But now I have a part I can't quite understand
1/2/24, 1:08 PM - +263 78 878 7885: You have mentioned that the registration fee is reduced to zero after being adjusted within the first year fee...
Could you shed more light here please?
1/2/24, 1:11 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Sure @263788787885, The registration fees is indeed reduced to zero as this registration fees will be adjusted in your first year tuition fess. However, In order to reserve your scholarship seat at the university you will need to make this payment.
1/2/24, 1:12 PM - +263 78 878 7885: OK thank you
1/2/24, 1:32 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
1/2/24, 1:35 PM - +263 78 878 7885: Yes ma'am
1/2/24, 1:40 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $1000, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $1000 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
1/2/24, 1:40 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $1000 = $1800. This amount can be paid in two installments of $900 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $900 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
1/2/24, 1:49 PM - +263 78 878 7885: Understood
1/2/24, 1:53 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
1/2/24, 1:53 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
1/2/24, 1:53 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
1/2/24, 1:55 PM - +263 78 878 7885: Following
1/2/24, 2:00 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
1/2/24, 2:07 PM - +263 78 878 7885: No ma'am
1/2/24, 2:10 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright please, Now with this, we are done with step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
1/2/24, 2:10 PM - Ashi Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one.
1/2/24, 2:10 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
1/2/24, 2:10 PM - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
1/2/24, 2:14 PM - +263 78 878 7885: Yes ma'am
1/2/24, 2:14 PM - Ashi Edoofa: The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
1/2/24, 2:14 PM - Ashi Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received special news for the students of the 2024 admission intake. May I know if you are excited to know the news we have for you?
1/2/24, 2:15 PM - +263 78 878 7885: Curious
1/2/24, 2:19 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am happy to see that you are excited. After speaking with thousands of students and parents who completed their admission process before you, we realized that the current economic situation in African countries makes it a bit challenging for parents to pay the full registration fee at once. 

In response to the same challenge, we had a detailed discussion with the academic board and university official. As a result, we developed a solution to alleviate the financial burden of the parents specifically for the registration fee due of $500 to $1000.
1/2/24, 2:19 PM - Ashi Edoofa: We at Edoofa are thrilled about this development, and I believe it will significantly help all of our students and their families. Are you aware of the solution?
1/2/24, 2:22 PM - +263 78 878 7885: Do you mean $1000 to $500 ma'am?
1/2/24, 2:22 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Yes dear
1/2/24, 2:23 PM - +263 78 878 7885: This is really thrilling news ma'am.
1/2/24, 2:23 PM - +263 78 878 7885: And will definitely make it much more easier
1/2/24, 2:24 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Indeed, let me share the same. With respect to the conversation we had with the academic board and the university officials, we requested them to allow the students to make the payment of their registration fee in two parts within a span of 45 days thereby reducing the financial pressure.
1/2/24, 2:24 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Here's how it works: Consider that your registration fee is $1000. After you will receive the offer letter, the first part of the registration fees which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, i.e. $500 needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university (For most of the universities 15 days). Subsequently, the second part of $500, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
1/2/24, 2:24 PM - Ashi Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for February 15, 2024, and your registration fee stands at $1000, you'll need to make a payment of $500 on or before February 15, 2024. The remaining $500 should be paid by March 15, 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
1/2/24, 2:26 PM - +263 78 878 7885: All clear ma'am
1/2/24, 2:27 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
1/2/24, 2:29 PM - +263 78 878 7885: Just to confirm, the registration fee is now $500?
1/2/24, 2:30 PM - Ashi Edoofa: No dear, We have shared the range with you which comes under $500 - $1000
1/2/24, 2:39 PM - +263 78 878 7885: Okay thank you
1/2/24, 2:39 PM - +263 78 878 7885: That'll be all
1/2/24, 2:41 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Yes dear, This is the registration fees
