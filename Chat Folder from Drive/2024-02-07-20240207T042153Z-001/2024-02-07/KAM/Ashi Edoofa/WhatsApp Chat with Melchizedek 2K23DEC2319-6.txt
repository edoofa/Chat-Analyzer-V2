If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
8/1/24, 3:43 PM - +27 73 074 2703: We can start
8/1/24, 3:44 PM - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
8/1/24, 3:45 PM - +27 73 074 2703: You may explain
8/1/24, 3:46 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -
8/1/24, 3:46 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
8/1/24, 3:46 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.
8/1/24, 3:46 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I hope these two steps are clear?
8/1/24, 3:50 PM - +27 73 074 2703: They are very clear
8/1/24, 3:56 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps-
8/1/24, 3:56 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
8/1/24, 3:56 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.
8/1/24, 3:56 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I hope you are following?
8/1/24, 3:59 PM - +27 73 074 2703: I am following
8/1/24, 4:05 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps-
8/1/24, 4:05 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of *$500 to $1000.* Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
8/1/24, 4:05 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.
8/1/24, 4:05 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I hope these are clear as well?
8/1/24, 4:06 PM - +27 73 074 2703: Thank you very much it is clear
8/1/24, 4:08 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for the further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
8/1/24, 4:08 PM - +27 73 074 2703: Yes we may
8/1/24, 4:12 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
8/1/24, 4:12 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually. 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
8/1/24, 4:13 PM - +27 73 074 2703: Yes you may
8/1/24, 4:15 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing, Let me share the videos with you -

Please go through the 4 videos, our next session will be scheduled after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarize your understanding. Hence I would like to know by when do you think you will be able to go through these videos so that we can schedule our next session accordingly?
8/1/24, 5:01 PM - +27 73 074 2703: I have just finished watching all the videos
8/1/24, 5:02 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am pleased to know that you were able to go through all the videos. If you don't mind, could you please share your understanding of all four videos with me so that I can assist you in expanding upon them and help you ensure you are on the right path in your educational journey?
8/1/24, 5:04 PM - +27 73 074 2703: The videos where very informative in showing me how the edoofa program works and how much care is put into the program it helped me to feel safe in knowing that you have taken great care in finding the best universities it also helped in knowing what I need to do during this process to get myself the best chance
8/1/24, 5:06 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Yes @27730742703 , that is correct. Let me also add to each video that you watched and help you summarize a few additional insights:
8/1/24, 5:06 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 1: Important Message for Enrolled Students*

The first video underscores the importance of two crucial qualities: open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions. Edoofa's vision for its students is to foster success in their careers, and promote responsibility, and independence. A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.
8/1/24, 5:06 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s Vision for You*

Edoofa's vision for its students is to provide them with employment opportunities and the skills necessary to become future leaders. The program places students above other candidates by investing significant time and effort into finding reputable, education-focused institutions rather than solely business-oriented ones.
8/1/24, 5:06 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

In the third video, it is highlighted that Edoofa's founders have dedicated over a decade to meticulously identify reputable educational institutions. Students are advised to cultivate the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to excel in the job market. All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to student's career goals.
8/1/24, 5:06 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools. It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.
8/1/24, 5:06 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In summary, these videos emphasize the significance of qualities such as open-mindedness, following instructions, and cooperation. Edoofa's vision is to empower students for successful careers and leadership roles by carefully selecting educational institutions. The SOP is a vital tool for effective communication and admission success. 

I hope you agree with all of this and were able to understand these by watching the four videos?
8/1/24, 5:08 PM - +27 73 074 2703: I do agree and it was evident from the videos
8/1/24, 5:11 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Brilliant, Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
8/1/24, 5:11 PM - +27 73 074 2703: We are on the same page
8/1/24, 5:13 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by tomorrow 12:30 PM.
8/1/24, 5:13 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

8/1/24, 5:14 PM - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>

8/1/24, 5:18 PM - Ashi Edoofa: For the next couple of days, we will have sessions on a daily basis and once we cover the first three steps of the admission cycle, we will have sessions scheduled on need basis. Hence, can you let me know at what time you would like us to schedule our sessions on a daily basis (from 12:30 Pm to 08:30 PM)?
8/1/24, 5:20 PM - +27 73 074 2703: The time we started today was perfectly fine it works for me
8/1/24, 5:22 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That is wonderful to hear. In that case, we will be concluding the conversation for now and we will reconnect tomorrow at 12:30 pm for our next session. 

I hope by then you will be able to fill out all the forms. If you have any queries or concerns before then, feel free to share them here in your admission group. Wish you a blessed day and please ensure to extend our regards to your family as well. <This message was edited>

9/1/24, 1:33 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Sure dear
9/1/24, 1:37 PM - +27 73 074 2703: <Media omitted>
9/1/24, 1:38 PM - +27 73 074 2703: This is my question one please forgive the naming as it just took my location as the name
9/1/24, 1:45 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright dear, Thank you for sharing your response regarding the SOP form and academic questions.  With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey.
9/1/24, 1:45 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Before we start our session, I was going through your scholarship application file and noticed that you are supposed to make the payment of your remaining part of Edoofa Enrollment fee before 1st February 2024. Hence, I thought of sharing a gentle reminder with you and try to understand how your preparation has been so far? Have you been able to align your preparations in the right direction?
9/1/24, 1:46 PM - +27 73 074 2703: Yes so my parents are making sure the preparations for the remainder is going well and to my understanding they are prepared
9/1/24, 1:47 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. We will reconnect with each other a few days before your due date to take a follow up on this and understand your preparations better,
9/1/24, 1:48 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In the meantime, let us move forward with our discussion. To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is *Bachelors in Computer Application* and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
9/1/24, 1:49 PM - +27 73 074 2703: That is accurate
9/1/24, 1:49 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for the confirmation. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
9/1/24, 1:49 PM - Ashi Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
9/1/24, 1:49 PM - Ashi Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
9/1/24, 1:49 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
9/1/24, 1:50 PM - +27 73 074 2703: That is correct
9/1/24, 1:54 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
9/1/24, 1:54 PM - Ashi Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of *$500 to $1000*. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
9/1/24, 1:54 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
9/1/24, 1:55 PM - +27 73 074 2703: That is correct
9/1/24, 1:56 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
9/1/24, 1:57 PM - +27 73 074 2703: We are on the same page
9/1/24, 1:58 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Registration Fee: $1000 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum
9/1/24, 1:58 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?*
9/1/24, 1:58 PM - +27 73 074 2703: I have taken note
9/1/24, 2:00 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $1000, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $1000 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
9/1/24, 2:00 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $1000= $1800. This amount can be paid in two installments of $900 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $900 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
9/1/24, 2:01 PM - +27 73 074 2703: Understood
9/1/24, 2:03 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
9/1/24, 2:03 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
9/1/24, 2:03 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
9/1/24, 2:04 PM - +27 73 074 2703: I understand
9/1/24, 2:06 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
9/1/24, 2:08 PM - +27 73 074 2703: No I do not
9/1/24, 2:08 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright please, I understand. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
9/1/24, 2:08 PM - Ashi Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
9/1/24, 2:08 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
9/1/24, 2:09 PM - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
9/1/24, 2:10 PM - +27 73 074 2703: This looks amazing
9/1/24, 2:12 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Yes, indeed @27730742703 . The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
9/1/24, 2:12 PM - Ashi Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
9/1/24, 2:15 PM - +27 73 074 2703: I appreciate your words
9/1/24, 2:16 PM - Ashi Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
9/1/24, 2:16 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
9/1/24, 2:16 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
9/1/24, 2:17 PM - +27 73 074 2703: I have reviewed the benefits
9/1/24, 2:18 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
9/1/24, 2:18 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 1. *Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa*.

On the basis of your A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive the letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa.
9/1/24, 2:18 PM - Ashi Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means you, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing your seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioning your as a frontier person in this endeavor.
9/1/24, 2:20 PM - +27 73 074 2703: I understand
9/1/24, 2:21 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 2. *Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.* 

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
9/1/24, 2:21 PM - Ashi Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
9/1/24, 2:21 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
9/1/24, 2:22 PM - +27 73 074 2703: Yes it does
9/1/24, 2:23 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 3.*Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $100 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $1000, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $900.
9/1/24, 2:23 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $1000 fee, you will only be required to pay $900. Once this payment is completed, the entire $1000 amount will be adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $100 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $1000. Does this explanation resonate with you?
9/1/24, 2:25 PM - +27 73 074 2703: Yes it does
9/1/24, 2:26 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 4. *Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.* 

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
9/1/24, 2:26 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $100 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
9/1/24, 2:26 PM - Ashi Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for January 30, 2024, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $900, you'll need to make a payment of $450 on or before January 30, 2024. The remaining $450 should be paid by February 30, 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
9/1/24, 2:28 PM - +27 73 074 2703: I am following and I fully understand

16/1/24, 10:20 PM - Ashi Edoofa: The university will be mailing you the official offer letter shortly. However, since we received it in advance, we wanted to share this wonderful news with you and provide a head start on our discussions.

In the meantime, I recommend that you make note of any questions or concerns that may arise as you review the letter. By setting a specific time, we can ensure that one of your family representatives will be available to connect with us.

16/1/24, 10:21 PM - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
17/1/24, 11:59 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Melchizedek ,

In light of the offer letter you received, I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to you and your family on this remarkable achievement in your academic journey.

Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion for you and your family, and I can only imagine the excitement that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.
17/1/24, 11:59 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Now that you have the letter in your possession, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you've had the chance to go through the offer letter thoroughly. 

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
17/1/24, 1:04 PM - +27 68 031 6913: Good afternoon
17/1/24, 1:19 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your response with us, May I kindly know if you have  gone through the above offer letter ?
17/1/24, 1:20 PM - +27 68 031 6913: Yes I did
17/1/24, 1:32 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As we proceed with today's discussion, we will get into the details of this specific offer letter. I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.
17/1/24, 1:32 PM - Ashi Edoofa: The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
17/1/24, 1:37 PM - +27 68 031 6913: Great
17/1/24, 2:12 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
17/1/24, 2:12 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion -	

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4. You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
17/1/24, 2:20 PM - +27 68 031 6913: 1. *900 USD* 
2. *3 years* 
3. *300 USD*
4. *750 USD*
17/1/24, 2:45 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Yes, that is absolutely correct and thank you for sharing your responses. As outlined in your offer letter, your course is a three-year program, with each academic year consisting of two semesters, totaling 6 semesters for your degree. 

With the scholarship offered, your tuition fee per semester reduces to $900, which means your annual tuition fee (calculated as $900 * 2) is $1800. I hope this clarifies the tuition fee structure for you?
17/1/24, 3:07 PM - +27 73 074 2703: Yes it does
17/1/24, 3:16 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am pleased that we've been able to make progress. Moving forward, I would like to help you with a concise overview of the two accommodation options available at Galgotias University -
17/1/24, 3:16 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well. <This message was edited>
17/1/24, 3:16 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You will be able to seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also go for accommodation independently and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
17/1/24, 3:17 PM - +27 73 074 2703: I understand
17/1/24, 3:18 PM - Ashi Edoofa: It is great to hear that you're following our conversation closely. I am sure you can see that Galgotias University values students' well-being and takes a thoughtful approach to accommodation arrangements.

They understand the significance of students feeling comfortable in their environment to excel academically. Instead of imposing choices, the university allows students to visit the campus, assess their options, and make informed decisions about whether they prefer on-campus or off-campus accommodation.

I hope this clarifies the university's approach to accommodation for you?
17/1/24, 3:19 PM - +27 73 074 2703: Yes it does
17/1/24, 3:26 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Moving forward, as you can see in your offer letter, you have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with the registration fee due as well?
17/1/24, 3:33 PM - +27 73 074 2703: Yes I am
17/1/24, 3:36 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright please, it is reassuring to see you following through. Please allow me to share some great news with you. As you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300, mentioned in the letter, has been entirely waived under the Early Registration Scheme and the Endowment Plan. This means it will not be added to your overall cost of education.
17/1/24, 3:37 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on January 30th 2024*. I hope we are together so far?
17/1/24, 3:41 PM - +27 73 074 2703: We are together
17/1/24, 3:50 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $100 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
17/1/24, 3:51 PM - +27 73 074 2703: Yes please
17/1/24, 3:51 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $100 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $650  of the registration fee. This $650 can be conveniently paid in two instalments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$325 before the first deadline date of January 30th, 2024* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$325  before the second deadline date of February 29th, 2024* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
17/1/24, 3:51 PM - Ashi Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $650 within 15 working days, before *January 30th, 2024*. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
17/1/24, 3:55 PM - +27 73 074 2703: We agree
17/1/24, 3:56 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
17/1/24, 3:56 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
17/1/24, 3:56 PM - +27 73 074 2703: I stay in South Africa
17/1/24, 4:06 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
17/1/24, 4:06 PM - Ashi Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
17/1/24, 4:06 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
17/1/24, 4:30 PM - +27 73 074 2703: Thank you
17/1/24, 4:33 PM - Ashi Edoofa: You are most welcome. Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
17/1/24, 4:33 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mama Money for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option.
17/1/24, 4:46 PM - +27 73 074 2703: Thank you for the options
17/1/24, 4:47 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now moving forward, to facilitate a simpler understanding, let me provide a summary of all the fee components we have discussed and share the total cost of education that you are expected to incur at Galgotias University:

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1,800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1,800 + $200 + $800 = $2,800
17/1/24, 4:48 PM - +27 73 074 2703: Understood
17/1/24, 4:49 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to see that you were able to follow through with our last message. Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $2800, let me also guide you on how we can make your education more affordable.

Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
17/1/24, 4:49 PM - Ashi Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn.

The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. I hope you have understood this?
17/1/24, 4:51 PM - +27 73 074 2703: Does this mean it is possible to pay for my entire annual fee with my earn while you learn credits?
17/1/24, 4:54 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Indeed @27730742703, With this said, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that you with your hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.

With these earned credits, you can use this $1000 to cover a portion of your annual fee, which is $2800. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $2800 - $1000 = $1800, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.

This illustrates how you can effectively make your education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
17/1/24, 6:49 PM - Ashi Edoofa: @27730742703 Are we still connected ?
17/1/24, 6:49 PM - +27 73 074 2703: Yes we are and I do understand
17/1/24, 6:50 PM - Ashi Edoofa: It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education while balancing your academics. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.
17/1/24, 6:50 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, that you have all the details with you and understand the letter better, I would like to enquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
17/1/24, 6:54 PM - +27 73 074 2703: No non thank you
17/1/24, 6:55 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now to attend to last part of our discussion, let me share a few insights into Galgotias University with you -
17/1/24, 6:55 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Galgotias University, situated in Delhi NCR, boasts an impressive academic reputation, ranking among the top 100 universities in India. One of its notable achievements is obtaining NAAC A+ Accreditation in the First Cycle, setting the highest standard for academic excellence.

A significant factor contributing to Galgotias University's consistent recognition as a top institution is its 'students-first' philosophy. This approach prioritizes the well-being and success of its students and aligns with Edoofa's values and mission.

One of the university's standout features is its dedication to maintaining a low student-to-faculty ratio. This approach ensures that students receive ample personal attention and mentoring, fostering a supportive and nurturing learning environment.
17/1/24, 6:55 PM - Ashi Edoofa: For your convenience, you can explore the university's official website through this link: [Galgotias University Government Recognition] (https://galgotiasuniversity.edu.in/government-recognition). 

Here, you'll find information about the accreditations and approvals granted by the Government of India, which reflect the university's commitment to meeting national educational standards.
