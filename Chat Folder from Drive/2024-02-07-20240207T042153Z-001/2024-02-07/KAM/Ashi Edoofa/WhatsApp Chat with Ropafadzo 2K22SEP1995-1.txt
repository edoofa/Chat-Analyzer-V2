16/1/24, 1:37 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Ropafadzo,

I trust this message finds you well, and I hope you are in high spirits. In recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their A-Level results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey.
16/1/24, 1:37 PM - Ashi Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?

16/1/24, 1:44 PM - +263 77 254 6217: Good Day. As a parent i am happy Ropafadzo got 11 points. We are yet to collect the physical slip from the school.
16/1/24, 3:46 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your results, and congratulations on successfully clearing all your A-Level subjects! Your hard work over the past few months has truly paid off.

I am sure your family is immensely proud of your achievements. Your A-level results have been duly noted, and we will quickly add them to your scholarship application. This will enable us to engage in discussions with the academic board and chart the best course of action for your next steps.
16/1/24, 3:46 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Kindly allow us some time to thoroughly evaluate your results and plan the way forward. Once we have re-evaluated your application, along with all the other applications, we will reconnect with you to discuss the next steps in your academic journey.

6/2/24, 8:23 PM - +263 77 254 6217: Good Day. How have you been . I would like to know if we are getting any responses from LPU any time soon. This is the most critical time where we have to decide on which University to enroll into. I am also concerned the Earn While you learn mentorship has not yet resumed and time is moving.
6/2/24, 8:27 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Greetings @263772546217, How are you doing?
6/2/24, 8:27 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Please don't worry, we will keep you updated on the application with the LPU University. Regarding the EWYL, Have you share any message in your group ?
6/2/24, 8:27 PM - +263 77 254 6217: Am doing great how about you
6/2/24, 8:28 PM - +263 77 254 6217: As an individual, I always believe that the learning process is life never ends and the more you learn, the better the guidance becomes, with a heavy heart, *I've chosen to immerse myself in higher education, and as a result, I'll be taking a step back from being your mentor🥺*
*You have a special place in my heart, and I am profoundly thankful for the honor of being your mentor*. Our journey doesn't end here; it merely takes a different course. I have full confidence in your continued success.

*I want to assure you that the Mentorship team will reach out to you soon to discuss the upcoming plan and ensure a seamless transition.*
All the best🫶🏻
