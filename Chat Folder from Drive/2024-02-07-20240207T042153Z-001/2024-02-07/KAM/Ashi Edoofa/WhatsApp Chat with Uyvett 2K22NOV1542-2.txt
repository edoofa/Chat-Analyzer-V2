As per our recent conversation, your fees were extended till the 30th of Nov. meaning that the second payment falls after a month that is 30th Dec. Hence I would like to let you know that since we are approaching the month's end may I know if you might be able to share an update with me regarding the payment. I will be having a meeting with the university officials tomorrow and will be discussing the same with them. Hence, may I know if you might be able to share an update about the second payment?

16/1/24, 1:38 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Uyvett,

I trust this message finds you well, and I hope you are in high spirits. In recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their A-Level results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey.
16/1/24, 1:50 PM - +263 77 210 4466: That's very true it is a journey full of memories
16/1/24, 3:54 PM - Ashi Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?

16/1/24, 6:04 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your results with us. I noticed that your A-level results didn't turn out as we had hoped, particularly with the challenge in one subject. However, I want to take a moment to remind you that this result is not a reflection of your abilities or potential. It's simply a hurdle on your academic journey, one that you are more than capable of overcoming.
16/1/24, 6:05 PM - Ashi Edoofa: It's important to remember that everyone faces setbacks at some point. What matters most is how we respond to them. This is an opportunity for growth and learning. Reflect on the experience, identify areas for improvement, and use this as a stepping stone towards future successes.
16/1/24, 6:05 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Rest assured, that you have Edoofa’s full support in navigating this phase. Whether it's discussing options for retaking the exam, exploring alternative career paths, or just needing someone to guide you, we are here for you. 

I have taken note of your results and I will add them to your scholarship application. This will enable us to engage in discussions with the academic board and chart the best course of action for your next steps.
16/1/24, 6:05 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Kindly allow us some time to thoroughly evaluate your results and plan the way forward. Once we have re-evaluated your application, along with all the other applications, we will reconnect with you to discuss the next steps in your academic journey.
