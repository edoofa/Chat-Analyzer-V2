31/1/24, 8:02 PM - +263 77 763 6776: Thank you for the opportunity and I’m pleased to get to tell you about myself.

I’m a 25 year old male bachelor of accounting honors university graduate hoping to further my studies in the field of accounting. 

I’m interested in physical exercise which I engage in on a daily basis at dawn. It has helped me cope with a lot over the years and not only because of the direct impact it has had in making me feel fit but also in the community of fellow runners and fitness enthusiasts like me that I encounter when I go out. 

As for the family, we are Zimbabweans and I have always stayed with my two parents and my younger sister in Harare. My mother is a teacher and my father is retired.

My aunt is my sponsor for this journey and her and my parents have been my biggest influencers all the way.
31/1/24, 8:05 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your story. It's inspiring to hear about your dedication to both academic and physical pursuits. The support of your family and your aunt as a sponsor speaks volumes about the strong foundation you have. Wishing you continued success in your accounting studies and your daily exercise routine.
31/1/24, 8:05 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Moving forward, I would like to bring an important aspect to your attention. The collective aim that we have for the student strongly values balanced involvement from parents, especially when the student is unable to participate. Your proactive engagement holds significant weight, and if, for any reason, either you or your guardians won't be available, we kindly request you to inform us beforehand so that we can plan and schedule our discussion beforehand. I hope you have taken note of this as well?
31/1/24, 8:07 PM - +263 77 763 6776: I have taken note and they have as well seeing as they are following up on the session as we proceed on their phones since they are in the group.
31/1/24, 8:08 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Fantastic! Now over the next four days, our focus as your admission team will be on equipping you with a comprehensive understanding of what lies ahead in your university admission journey and help you commence the same.
31/1/24, 8:08 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Soon after, we will guide you through the initiation of your EWYL Journey. The next batch of EWYL Sessions is scheduled to commence on Friday (February 09th) and hence, if we are able to focus and complete the Admission Process before Friday with pure consistency, you will be able to start your EWYL journey as well in a timely manner.
31/1/24, 8:08 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Kindly mark this date on your calendar and ensure that you are available to complete the necessary procedures within the stipulated timeline. If everything is proceeding as planned so far, shall we move forward and begin our session for the day?
31/1/24, 8:10 PM - +263 77 763 6776: I’m taking note of the date and yes we may move forward
31/1/24, 8:13 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Right, now moving forward, let me brief you that your admissions process and your EWYL program will operate concurrently in the future, therefore you will have two Whatsapp groups to connect with the team:
31/1/24, 8:13 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 1. The admissions group *(Trevor 2K24JAN2699)*  will be the platform where we, as your admission officers, will be communicating with you. This group is dedicated to all-important discussions like your university admission process, offer letter discussion, and ultimately your university registration and reservation of your scholarship along with the Visa process. This group will continue to assist you with your admission-related queries while you are here in India.
31/1/24, 8:14 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 2. Earn While You Learn Program *(Trevor EWYL23E1253)*. In this group, your EWYL mentor, head of the department, and head coach will be present. With this group, we will make sure you are prepared to self-finance your education here in India. With your dedicated efforts in the EWYL program, you will earn maximum scholarship credits.
31/1/24, 8:14 PM - Ashi Edoofa: This group will keep a record of the tasks and projects you undertake. You will be provided with the link to the group after the completion of the admission process session and on the dedicated date for your EWYL session, where you will be able to directly speak to your EWYL mentor. I hope you are clear about the purpose of the two groups.
31/1/24, 8:23 PM - +263 77 763 6776: Yes it’s all clear
31/1/24, 8:31 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to know that you are clear about the purpose of the two WhatsApp groups and it's reassuring to hear this from your end. I also had a recent conversation with your counselor, during which he provided me with some insights into your academic background and career aspirations. I must commend you as a family, you must take great pride in your achievements and be dedicated to ensuring your access to the finest opportunities to launch your career.
31/1/24, 8:31 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Speaking of valuable opportunities, I am also curious to learn more about your counseling session with your counselor and to understand which aspects of the Edoofa Scholarship Program have particularly impressed you thus far. Can you share this with me?
31/1/24, 8:32 PM - +263 77 763 6776: Thank you for recognizing that
31/1/24, 8:36 PM - +263 77 763 6776: Well the idea of being able to earn scholarship credits that will go towards covering the completion of my education was something I commended.

I felt grateful for the program’s efforts to want all students to be able to work as they learn so as to get industry experience. I believe it goes a long way unlike only getting equipped with the classroom content.
31/1/24, 8:38 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for your kind words and feedback. We're thrilled to hear that you appreciate the mission and values of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. We are dedicated to making higher education accessible and affordable, and your success and satisfaction are our top priorities.

31/1/24, 8:38 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Moving forward with the procedures, I would like to share an insight with you. To ensure a seamless experience, we as a team, have prepared essential documents that not only value your feedback but also outline the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program and the application process. You will have to review, complete, and submit these documents as instructed. 

If you are ready, shall I share a brief overview of these documents for your ease?
31/1/24, 8:39 PM - +263 77 763 6776: Please share
31/1/24, 8:40 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Perfect! Let's delve into the documents that are crucial for your journey with Edoofa.

31/1/24, 8:49 PM - +263 77 763 6776: I have taken note
31/1/24, 8:52 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Along with these forms, I have asked you to share your academic documents with us. I am currently waiting for that as well.

Moving forward, as a part of your application file, you will need to visit your school and secure a letter of recommendation from them. We have attached a sample document to help guide you through the process.
31/1/24, 8:52 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Here are some key points to consider when requesting the letter from your school:

1. *Visit Your School*: Approach your school administration or the designated authority for issuing such letters.

2. *Provide Necessary Information*: Ensure that the drafted letter includes essential details such as your identity as a student of the school, your subject combination for A Level exams, and your intention to sit for the exams this academic year.

3. *Printing and Signing*: Request the school to print the letter on official letterhead and have it signed/stamped by the appropriate authority.

4. *Include Authority Details*: Ensure that the letter contains the details of the signing authority, including their full name, contact number, and email ID.
31/1/24, 8:52 PM - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
31/1/24, 8:52 PM - Ashi Edoofa: This letter of recommendation is a crucial document that will support your application process. The Edoofa Academic Board will use those details to reach out to your school authorities and verify the recommendation letter before adding it to your scholarship application and hence I would like to inquire by when will you be able to share the same document with us?
31/1/24, 9:03 PM - +263 77 763 6776: I believe in the next 7 days if they are available to assist me via email or other electronic means. 

If not, I’ll be letting you know before the 7 days passes when I’ll be able to visit the school to secure the recommendation
31/1/24, 9:11 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright dear. I am looking forward to getting an update from your end. I would also like to reiterate that our operational hours are from 12:30 PM to 8:30 PM, Central African Time.
31/1/24, 9:11 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Considering this, for our future sessions, you have to decide on an hour’s time that suits your availability within this timeframe and share the same with us so that we can tailor our subsequent sessions to accommodate your schedule effectively.

Hence, can you let me know at what time you would like us to schedule our sessions on a daily basis (from 12:30 Pm to 08:30 PM)?
31/1/24, 9:14 PM - +263 77 763 6776: Tomorrow 6pm
From Friday onwards 12:30pm
31/1/24, 9:15 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know, in such a case, we will schedule tomorrow’s session at 6:00 pm. It's important to note that all three forms and your academic documents should be completed and submitted by tomorrow before our session.

1/2/24, 7:07 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Moving forward in our today’s session, we will discuss a bit about your university admission journey. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts. I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them.

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
1/2/24, 7:07 PM - +263 77 763 6776: You’re welcome
1/2/24, 7:07 PM - +263 77 763 6776: We may start
1/2/24, 7:08 PM - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
1/2/24, 7:09 PM - +263 77 763 6776: Alright
I’ve gone through the image
1/2/24, 7:11 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -
1/2/24, 7:11 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
1/2/24, 7:11 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.
1/2/24, 7:11 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I hope these two steps are clear?
1/2/24, 7:15 PM - +263 77 763 6776: Yes
They are clear
1/2/24, 7:17 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps-
1/2/24, 7:17 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
1/2/24, 7:17 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.
1/2/24, 7:17 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I hope you are following?
1/2/24, 7:18 PM - +263 77 763 6776: Yes, I am following
It is very clear
1/2/24, 7:18 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps-
1/2/24, 7:18 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of *$500 to $1000.* Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
1/2/24, 7:19 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.
1/2/24, 7:20 PM - +263 77 763 6776: Alright.
1/2/24, 7:20 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for the further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
1/2/24, 7:21 PM - +263 77 763 6776: Yes, we may start
1/2/24, 7:22 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
1/2/24, 7:22 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding until you are ready, shall we start with our discussion with me individually? 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
1/2/24, 7:23 PM - +263 77 763 6776: Yes we may
1/2/24, 7:25 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing, Let me share the videos with you. I am sure you must be excited for the videos.
1/2/24, 7:26 PM - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
1/2/24, 7:26 PM - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
1/2/24, 7:26 PM - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
1/2/24, 7:26 PM - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
1/2/24, 7:27 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection. 

Please go through the 4 videos, our next session will be scheduled after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarize your understanding. Hence I would like to know by when do you think you will be able to go through these videos so that we can schedule our next session accordingly?
1/2/24, 7:29 PM - +263 77 763 6776: I can be done watching & formulating a summary of my understanding in an hour
1/2/24, 7:34 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing dear, Once you are done please do let me know
1/2/24, 7:35 PM - +263 77 763 6776: Alright, I will
1/2/24, 8:28 PM - +263 77 763 6776: I have managed to go through all the videos and firstly I have to applaud the wealth of information in these videos
1/2/24, 8:31 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am pleased to know that you were able to go through all the videos. If you don't mind, could you please share your understanding of all four videos with me so that I can assist you in expanding upon them and help you ensure you are on the right path in your educational journey?
1/2/24, 8:32 PM - +263 77 763 6776: I believe the emphasis on being open minded coupled with the willingness to learn that was being shared in the videos is worth to make note of. 

It has definitely been imprinted in my mind just how important it is to do so as well as the ability to follow instructions  for a successful EWYL experience
1/2/24, 8:34 PM - +263 77 763 6776: I understood just how much the discipline to follow instructions can lead to a more successful experience in earning scholarship credits and a more satisfying Edoofa program enrollment process
1/2/24, 8:38 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That is correct. Let me also add to each video that you watched and help you summarize a few additional insights:
1/2/24, 8:38 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 1: Important Message for Enrolled Students*

The first video underscores the importance of two crucial qualities: open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions. Edoofa's vision for its students is to foster success in their careers, and promote responsibility, and independence. A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.
1/2/24, 8:38 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s Vision for You*

Edoofa's vision for its students is to provide them with employment opportunities and the skills necessary to become future leaders. The program places students above other candidates by investing significant time and effort into finding reputable, education-focused institutions rather than solely business-oriented ones.
1/2/24, 8:38 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

In the third video, it is highlighted that Edoofa's founders have dedicated over a decade to meticulously identify reputable educational institutions. Students are advised to cultivate the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to excel in the job market. All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to student's career goals.
1/2/24, 8:38 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools. It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.
1/2/24, 8:38 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In summary, these videos emphasize the significance of qualities such as open-mindedness, following instructions, and cooperation. Edoofa's vision is to empower students for successful careers and leadership roles by carefully selecting educational institutions. The SOP is a vital tool for effective communication and admission success. 

I hope you agree with all of this and were able to understand these by watching the four videos?
1/2/24, 8:39 PM - +263 77 763 6776: I’ve also come to appreciate how much Edoofa makes it so much easier for students to earn real work experience as they learn.

The pride of being an Edoofian is another point to exclaim from the way it is conveyed in the videos. The Edoofa community helps all students interact with like minded students and a dedicated team to ensure a smoother process
1/2/24, 8:46 PM - +263 77 763 6776: I understood very well the intent of the videos and your clarity in pinpointing the takeaways from each video has solidified my understanding
1/2/24, 8:46 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Brilliant, Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
1/2/24, 8:47 PM - +263 77 763 6776: Yes, we are
1/2/24, 8:48 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by tomorrow 12:30 PM.
1/2/24, 8:48 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

1/2/24, 8:48 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete the form that have been provided to you, we will have completed the second step of your university admission process. At that point, we will be prepared to move on to the third step, which involves understanding the registration process. Could you kindly confirm when you will be able to complete these tasks and reconnect with us? This will allow us to schedule our discussion accordingly.
1/2/24, 8:50 PM - +263 77 763 6776: I can fill out the form before our next session
1/2/24, 8:51 PM - +263 77 763 6776: Again, is it possible to reschedule our next session to 6pm like we did today
1/2/24, 8:51 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That is wonderful to hear. In that case, we will be concluding the conversation for now and we will reconnect tomorrow at 06:00 pm for our next session. 

I hope by then you will be able to fill out the forms. If you have any queries or concerns before then, feel free to share them here in your admission group. Wish you a blessed night and please ensure to extend our regards to your family as well.
1/2/24, 8:52 PM - +263 77 763 6776: Thank you, and I will
2/2/24, 6:05 PM - +263 77 763 6776: Good day
2/2/24, 6:06 PM - +263 77 763 6776: I am sorry to inconvenience the process but may we postpone this session to tomorrow 12:30PM
2/2/24, 6:07 PM - +263 77 763 6776: Where I currently am there minimal internet connectivity which is a challenge to work with
2/2/24, 6:07 PM - +263 77 763 6776: I am very sorry for any inconvenience this has caused
2/2/24, 6:26 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Greetings dear, Let's connect tomorrow at 12:30 pm in that case
2/2/24, 7:10 PM - +263 77 763 6776: Thank you so much for understanding & accommodating me

3/2/24, 1:10 PM - +263 77 763 6776: <Media omitted>
3/2/24, 1:10 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Trevor, Wishing you a good day !
3/2/24, 1:10 PM - +263 77 763 6776: Good afternoon
3/2/24, 1:11 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your response for SOP form. With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey.
3/2/24, 1:11 PM - +263 77 763 6776: Ok. Thank you
3/2/24, 1:12 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Before we proceed to the next stage, I'd like to assist you in getting started with your EWYL Journey. Based on your EWYL application form, you are scheduled to commence your EWYL journey on Friday (09-Feb-2024).
3/2/24, 1:12 PM - Ashi Edoofa: With your intention and commencement date in mind, we have already communicated this information to the EWYL team. They are prepared to initiate your EWYL program on Friday, as previously agreed upon.

To kick start the process, your dedicated EWYL Mentor has established your EWYL Group and shared the invitation link with us. Here's what you and your parents/guardian/sponsor need to do:

https://chat.whatsapp.com/D8UCX2qefcwJDCyWb0uFKq
3/2/24, 1:13 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Use the provided link to join your group. Once both you and your parents have joined, please send the following message to the group:

*Dear Mentor, my name is Trevor Kaiboni, and my EWYL group name is Trevor EWYL23E1253. I am excited to begin my EWYL Journey. As discussed with the admission team, I am committed to being available on Friday (09-Feb-2024) to commence the procedures. Kindly schedule my session for the same date so that I can maximize the benefits and start on the right track.*
3/2/24, 1:13 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Once you start with the EWYL Program and are able to connect with your mentor, please update the same here as well by sending the below message -

*Hello Admission officer, I am now in touch with my EWYL Mentor. The name of my Mentor is _________ and he/she has scheduled my session for ________*(mention the date)
3/2/24, 1:14 PM - +263 77 763 6776: Alright. Let me do so
3/2/24, 1:15 PM - Ashi Edoofa: With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey. we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*.
3/2/24, 1:16 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In the meantime, let us move forward with our discussion. To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is *Master of Commerce* and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
3/2/24, 1:25 PM - +263 77 763 6776: Yes it is accurate
3/2/24, 1:27 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
3/2/24, 1:27 PM - Ashi Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
3/2/24, 1:27 PM - Ashi Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
3/2/24, 1:27 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
3/2/24, 1:37 PM - +263 77 763 6776: Right
3/2/24, 1:39 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly. <This message was edited>
3/2/24, 1:39 PM - Ashi Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $1000. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
3/2/24, 1:39 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
3/2/24, 1:41 PM - +263 77 763 6776: Correct
3/2/24, 1:42 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
3/2/24, 1:43 PM - +263 77 763 6776: Yes
3/2/24, 1:45 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

1. *Tuition Fee*: $1800 per annum
2. *Food and Accommodation Fee*: $1000 per annum 

*Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum*
3/2/24, 1:45 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Registration Fee to be paid: $1000 (deadline within two weeks of issue of the offer letter, part of the university’s first-year fee and will be adjusted against the first-year cost of education $2800). I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?
3/2/24, 2:00 PM - +263 77 763 6776: Yes
3/2/24, 2:01 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $1000, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $1000 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
3/2/24, 2:02 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $1000 = $1800. This amount can be paid in two installments of $900 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $900 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
3/2/24, 2:04 PM - +263 77 763 6776: Noted
3/2/24, 2:04 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
3/2/24, 2:04 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
3/2/24, 2:04 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
3/2/24, 2:05 PM - +263 77 763 6776: Noted as well
3/2/24, 2:06 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
3/2/24, 2:07 PM - +263 77 763 6776: No
3/2/24, 2:07 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright please, Now with this, we are done with step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
3/2/24, 2:07 PM - Ashi Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one.
3/2/24, 2:08 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
3/2/24, 2:08 PM - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
3/2/24, 2:18 PM - +263 77 763 6776: It is really inspiring
3/2/24, 2:21 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Yes, indeed. The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
3/2/24, 2:22 PM - Ashi Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received special news for the students of the 2024 admission intake. May I know if you are excited to know the news we have for you?
3/2/24, 2:24 PM - +263 77 763 6776: Yes
3/2/24, 2:24 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am happy to see that you are excited. After speaking with thousands of students and parents who completed their admission process before you, we realized that the current economic situation in African countries makes it a bit challenging for parents to pay the full registration fee at once. 

In response to the same challenge, we had a detailed discussion with the academic board and university official. As a result, we developed a solution to alleviate the financial burden of the parents specifically for the registration fee due of $500 to $1000.
3/2/24, 2:24 PM - Ashi Edoofa: We at Edoofa are thrilled about this development, and I believe it will significantly help all of our students and their families. Are you aware of the solution?
3/2/24, 2:25 PM - +263 77 763 6776: Please share it
3/2/24, 2:25 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That is alright, let me share the same. With respect to the conversation we had with the academic board and the university officials, we requested them to allow the students to make the payment of their registration fee in two parts within a span of 45 days thereby reducing the financial pressure.
3/2/24, 2:26 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Here's how it works: Consider that your registration fee is $1000. After you will receive the offer letter, the first part of the registration fees which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, i.e. $500 needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university (For most of the universities 15 days). Subsequently, the second part of $500, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
3/2/24, 2:26 PM - Ashi Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for February 15, 2024, and your registration fee stands at $1000, you'll need to make a payment of $500 on or before February 15, 2024. The remaining $500 should be paid by March 15, 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
3/2/24, 2:27 PM - +44 7947 178735: This is Constance Mundangepfupfu. I’m following the conversation.
3/2/24, 2:28 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to know that you are following our conversation
3/2/24, 2:28 PM - +263 77 763 6776: It’s clear
3/2/24, 2:28 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
3/2/24, 2:29 PM - +263 77 763 6776: No
3/2/24, 2:29 PM - Ashi Edoofa: So,  are you excited to initiate the process? For the current round of admissions, only 31 scholarship seats are available and hence let us begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the payment plan offered for the registration fee. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
3/2/24, 2:30 PM - +263 77 763 6776: Yes
3/2/24, 2:31 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation and with your approval, we will now proceed with the preparations for the application and submit it to the universities recommended by the academic board, tailored to your chosen course. 

Once we receive updates from the universities, we will quickly reconnect with you and share all the relevant information.
