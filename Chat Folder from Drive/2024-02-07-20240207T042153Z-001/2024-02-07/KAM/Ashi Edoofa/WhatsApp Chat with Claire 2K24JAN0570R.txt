19/1/24, 1:42 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.
19/1/24, 1:42 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I hope these two steps are clear?
19/1/24, 1:44 PM - +263 77 684 2739: Yes
19/1/24, 1:46 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps-
19/1/24, 1:46 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things.

They are now telling us how it is to be an Edoofian so that I do not regret in the future for making this decision of being part of them.From what I heard here,they said Edoofians are being trained,they are working and earn scholarship credits to become successful and that is being independent. Most students who become successful are the ones that are teachable, open minded and those who are extra minded.
20/1/24, 9:40 PM - +263 77 684 2739: Here they are sharing the vision that they have for students.

22/1/24, 1:16 PM - +263 77 684 2739: Yes
22/1/24, 1:20 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing, Let me also add to each video that you watched and help you summarize a few additional insights:
22/1/24, 1:20 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 1: Important Message for Enrolled Students*

The first video underscores the importance of two crucial qualities: open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions. Edoofa's vision for its students is to foster success in their careers, and promote responsibility, and independence. A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.
22/1/24, 1:20 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s Vision for You*

Edoofa's vision for its students is to provide them with employment opportunities and the skills necessary to become future leaders. The program places students above other candidates by investing significant time and effort into finding reputable, education-focused institutions rather than solely business-oriented ones.
22/1/24, 1:20 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

In the third video, it is highlighted that Edoofa's founders have dedicated over a decade to meticulously identify reputable educational institutions. Students are advised to cultivate the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to excel in the job market. All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to student's career goals.
22/1/24, 1:20 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools. It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.
22/1/24, 1:20 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In summary, these videos emphasize the significance of qualities such as open-mindedness, following instructions, and cooperation. Edoofa's vision is to empower students for successful careers and leadership roles by carefully selecting educational institutions. The SOP is a vital tool for effective communication and admission success. 

I hope you agree with all of this and were able to understand these by watching the four videos?
22/1/24, 1:35 PM - +263 77 684 2739: Yes
22/1/24, 1:35 PM - +263 77 684 2739: I agree
22/1/24, 1:39 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
22/1/24, 1:41 PM - +263 77 684 2739: Yes we are
22/1/24, 1:42 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by tomorrow 12:30 PM.
22/1/24, 1:42 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded.

Could you kindly confirm when you will be able to complete these tasks and reconnect with us? This will allow us to schedule our discussion accordingly.
22/1/24, 1:43 PM - +263 77 684 2739: Okay
22/1/24, 1:45 PM - +263 77 684 2739: Thank you
22/1/24, 1:47 PM - +263 77 684 2739: By 13:00 PM tomorrow I'll be done
22/1/24, 2:04 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That is wonderful to hear. In that case, we will be concluding the conversation for now and we will reconnect tomorrow at 1:00 pm for our next session. 

I hope by then you will be able to fill out all the forms. If you have any queries or concerns before then, feel free to share them here in your admission group. Wish you a blessed day and please ensure to extend our regards to your family as well.
22/1/24, 2:06 PM - +263 77 684 2739: I don't have any query for now
22/1/24, 2:06 PM - +263 77 684 2739: Thank you
22/1/24, 2:15 PM - Ashi Edoofa: You are welcome dear

23/1/24, 1:09 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your response dear, I am glad to see that you have completed the SOP form, May I kindly know if you have completed the academic questions as well ?
23/1/24, 1:24 PM - +263 77 684 2739: Yes
23/1/24, 1:25 PM - +263 77 684 2739: The answer of question 1 needs to be recorded isn't it?
23/1/24, 1:27 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Yes dear, You need to share a voice note
23/1/24, 1:28 PM - +263 77 684 2739: Okay
23/1/24, 1:46 PM - +263 77 684 2739: <Media omitted>
23/1/24, 4:14 PM - +263 77 684 2739: 2)The scope of medical lab technology is vast and overgrowing. As new discoveries are made in the field of medicine, the role of lab technicians becomes even more important. Lab technicians also help to ensure the accuracy and reliability of lab results, which is essential for the overall and delivery of quality healthcare. Medical laboratory scientists have a wide variety of responsibilities and duties including: examining and analyzing blood, body fluids, tissues tissues and cells,giving test results to physicians,utilizing microscopes,cell counters and other high-precision lab equipment. Typical lab technicians record, analyze and interpret data,demonstrating procedures, collecting, preparing or testing sterility of the equipment. Medical laboratory scientists perform complex tests on patient samples using sophisticated equipment like microscopes. The data they find plays an important role in identifying and treating cancer, heart disease, diabetes, and other medical conditions.Medical laboratory technologists also play a role in research and development, working to develop new tests and improve the accuracy and efficiency of existing tests.
23/1/24, 4:56 PM - +263 77 684 2739: 3)Good laboratory practice or GLP is a quality system of management controls for research laboratories and organizations to ensure the uniformity,consistency, reliability quality and integrity of products in development for human health.It can also be defined as a quality system covering the organizational process and conditions under which non-clinical laboratory studies are planned, performed, monitored, recorded reported and archived.Some of the GLP fundamentals are: wear Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) at all times. Communicate with other members of the research lab.Participate in refresher training and safety exercises. Be aware of what you are doing at all times. Pay attention to unfamiliar smells and substances. GLP principles should cover all aspects of a laboratory's daily activity,such as the layout of testing and storage areas to prevent contamination, cleaning and calibration of equipment, handling of test animals and recording and archiving of test results. GLP is followed in the lab because it is a set of guadlines that help ensure the quality and reliability of lab results. By following GLP, lab technicians can ensure that their work is accurate and consistent
23/1/24, 5:41 PM - +263 77 684 2739: 4)There are several sterilization methods used in labs,depending on the type of equipment or material being sterilized. Some of the most common methods include autoclaving, ethylene oxide sterilization, and gas plasma sterilization.Each of these methods has it's own advantages and disadvantages.

Sterilization methods are important for several reasons. First,it helps to prevent the spread of infection. By killing microorganisms, sterilization helps to maintain the integrity of lab technicians. By ensuring that all equipments and materials are free of contamination, scientists can be confident can be confident that their results are accurate and reliable. Finally, sterilization helps to keep lab workers safe from exposure to potentially harmful microorganisms. 

Autoclaving uses high-pressure steam to kill microorganisms. The process starts by sealing the items to be sterilized in an autoclave. The autoclave is then heated to a high temperature, typically around 121 degrees Celsius.The  steam inside the autoclave reaches a pressure of around 15 pounds per square inch.This combination of high pressure kills microorganisms by denaturing their proteins and disrupting their cell membranes.
23/1/24, 5:51 PM - Ashi Edoofa: @263776842739 May I know by when you will be able to complete them ?
23/1/24, 5:52 PM - +263 77 684 2739: 06:10 PM
23/1/24, 5:53 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright @263776842739
23/1/24, 6:15 PM - +263 77 684 2739: There are several different techniques for placing samples under a microscope, depending on the type of the sample and the type of the microscope being used. One common method is called the wet mount technique. This involves placing a drop of water on a slide,then placing the sample on the top of the water.The sample is then covered with a cover slip. This technique is often used for transparent samples, such as cells or thin tissue sections. Another common technique is called the dry mount technique. This involves placing the sample directly on the slide,then covering it with a cover slip. This technique is often used for solid samples, such as insects or leaves. Another common technique is called the hanging drop technique.This technique is often used for small,three  dimensional samples,such as bacteria or protozoa. In this technique a drop of water is placed on a slide and a cover slip is placed on top.The slide is then turned upside down, so the drop of water hangs off the edge off the slide. The sample is then added to the drop of water and allowed to settle.The cover slip is then slowly lowered onto the drop of water, creating a "hanging" drop that is sandwiched between the cover slip and the slide. The sample can then be observed under a microscope.
23/1/24, 6:16 PM - +263 77 684 2739: I am done
23/1/24, 6:19 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for providing your response. With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey.

Before we proceed to the next stage, I'd like to assist you in getting started with your EWYL Journey. Based on your EWYL application form, you are scheduled to commence your EWYL journey on Tuesday (23-Jan-2024).
23/1/24, 6:19 PM - Ashi Edoofa: With your intention and commencement date in mind, we have already communicated this information to the EWYL team. They are prepared to initiate your EWYL program on Tuesday, as previously agreed upon.

To kick start the process, your dedicated EWYL Mentor has established your EWYL Group and shared the invitation link with us. Here's what you and your parents/guardian/sponsor need to do:

https://chat.whatsapp.com/InjOT7xjGiWB8tnqBFM0dJ
23/1/24, 6:19 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Use the provided link to join your group. Once both you and your parents have joined, please send the following message to the group:

*Dear Mentor, my name is Similo Claire Thebe, and my EWYL group name is Claire EWYL23E1192. I am excited to begin my EWYL Journey. As discussed with the admission team, I am committed to being available on Tuesday (23-Jan-2024) to commence the procedures. Kindly schedule my session for the same date so that I can maximize the benefits and start on the right track.*
23/1/24, 6:20 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Once you start with the EWYL Program and are able to connect with your mentor, please update the same here as well by sending the below message -

*Hello Admission officer, I am now in touch with my EWYL Mentor. The name of my Mentor is _________ and he/she has scheduled my session for ________*(mention the date)
23/1/24, 6:29 PM - +263 77 684 2739: Can I send the message before my parents join or I should wait for them to join?
23/1/24, 6:30 PM - +263 77 684 2739: They are offline ryt now
23/1/24, 6:30 PM - Ashi Edoofa: You can share the message now dear
23/1/24, 6:35 PM - +263 77 684 2739: Okay
23/1/24, 6:36 PM - Ashi Edoofa: With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey. we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*.

In the meantime, let us move forward with our discussion. To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is *Diploma in Medical Lab. Technology* and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
23/1/24, 6:43 PM - +263 77 684 2739: Yes it is accurate
23/1/24, 6:46 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
23/1/24, 6:47 PM - Ashi Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
23/1/24, 6:49 PM - Ashi Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
23/1/24, 6:49 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
23/1/24, 6:52 PM - +263 77 684 2739: Noted
23/1/24, 6:53 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
23/1/24, 6:53 PM - Ashi Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $1000. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
23/1/24, 6:53 PM - +263 77 684 2739: Okay
23/1/24, 6:53 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
23/1/24, 6:54 PM - +263 77 684 2739: Okay
23/1/24, 6:55 PM - +263 77 684 2739: Yes
23/1/24, 6:55 PM - +263 77 684 2739: Yes he did
23/1/24, 6:57 PM - +263 77 684 2739: Okay
23/1/24, 6:59 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
23/1/24, 11:15 PM - +263 77 684 2739: Yes
24/1/24, 10:12 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Claire, I hope you are doing well!
24/1/24, 10:13 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for not connecting with you yesterday as you have shared your response with me after my available hours. However, I would love to connect with you today so that we can move ahead with our discussion. On the same note, May I know if you are ready for today's discussion ? <This message was edited>
24/1/24, 1:36 PM - +263 77 684 2739: Yes
24/1/24, 1:38 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing, Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

1. *Tuition Fee*: $1800 per annum
2. *Food and Accommodation Fee*: $1000 per annum 

*Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum*
24/1/24, 1:38 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Registration Fee to be paid: $1000 (deadline within two weeks of issue of the offer letter, part of the university’s first-year fee and will be adjusted against the first-year cost of education $2800). I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?
24/1/24, 3:10 PM - +263 77 684 2739: Yes
24/1/24, 3:14 PM - +263 77 684 2739: Hello Admission officer,I'm now in touch with my EWYL Mentor.The name of my Mentor is Ms Aditi and she has scheduled my session for 08:30 to 09:30 tomorrow.
24/1/24, 3:32 PM - Ashi Edoofa: It's wonderful to hear that you've connected with your EWYL Mentor, Ms. Aditi. This is a significant step in your journey, and I want to express my heartfelt congratulations to you for taking this initiative.

Wishing you all the best as you begin this exciting chapter. May it be filled with learning, personal growth, and, above all, a genuine sense of accomplishment.
24/1/24, 3:35 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $1000, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $1000 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
24/1/24, 3:37 PM - +263 77 684 2739: Noted
24/1/24, 3:37 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $1000 = $1800. This amount can be paid in two installments of $900 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $900 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
24/1/24, 3:40 PM - +263 77 684 2739: Noted
24/1/24, 3:43 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
24/1/24, 3:43 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
24/1/24, 3:43 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
24/1/24, 3:47 PM - +263 77 684 2739: Okay
24/1/24, 3:54 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
24/1/24, 3:57 PM - +263 77 684 2739: I don't have any query
24/1/24, 3:57 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright please, Now with this, we are done with step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
24/1/24, 3:58 PM - Ashi Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one.
24/1/24, 3:58 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
24/1/24, 3:58 PM - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
24/1/24, 3:59 PM - +263 77 684 2739: Thank you
24/1/24, 4:00 PM - Ashi Edoofa: You are welcome @263776842739 The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
24/1/24, 4:00 PM - Ashi Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received special news for the students of the 2024 admission intake. May I know if you are excited to know the news we have for you?
24/1/24, 4:01 PM - +263 77 684 2739: Yes I'm excited to know
24/1/24, 4:02 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am happy to see that you are excited. After speaking with thousands of students and parents who completed their admission process before you, we realized that the current economic situation in African countries makes it a bit challenging for parents to pay the full registration fee at once.
24/1/24, 4:03 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In response to the same challenge, we had a detailed discussion with the academic board and university official. As a result, we developed a solution to alleviate the financial burden of the parents specifically for the registration fee due of $500 to $1000.
24/1/24, 4:03 PM - Ashi Edoofa: We at Edoofa are thrilled about this development, and I believe it will significantly help all of our students and their families. Are you aware of the solution?
24/1/24, 4:05 PM - +263 77 684 2739: Yes yes
24/1/24, 4:06 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That is alright, let me share the same. With respect to the conversation we had with the academic board and the university officials, we requested them to allow the students to make the payment of their registration fee in two parts within a span of 45 days thereby reducing the financial pressure.
24/1/24, 4:06 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Here's how it works: Consider that your registration fee is $1000. After you will receive the offer letter, the first part of the registration fees which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, i.e. $500 needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university (For most of the universities 15 days). Subsequently, the second part of $500, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
24/1/24, 4:06 PM - Ashi Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for January 25, 2024, and your registration fee stands at $1000, you'll need to make a payment of $500 on or before January 25, 2024. The remaining $500 should be paid by February 25 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
24/1/24, 4:09 PM - +263 77 684 2739: That is good
24/1/24, 4:10 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
24/1/24, 4:11 PM - +263 77 684 2739: That is good
24/1/24, 4:12 PM - +263 77 684 2739: I don't have any query
24/1/24, 4:12 PM - Ashi Edoofa: So, Are you excited to initiate the process? For the current round of admissions, only 31 scholarship seats are available and hence let us begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the payment plan offered for the registration fee. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
24/1/24, 4:13 PM - +263 77 684 2739: Yes I am
24/1/24, 4:14 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation and with your approval, we will now proceed with the preparations for the application and submit it to the universities recommended by the academic board, tailored to your chosen course.
