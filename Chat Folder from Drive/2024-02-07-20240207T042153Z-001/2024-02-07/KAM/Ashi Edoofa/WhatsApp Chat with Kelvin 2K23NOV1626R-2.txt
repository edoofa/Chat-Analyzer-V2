Can we get an extension for paying the balance? Since I get paid on the last day of January, by the 28, the money won’t be available yet. However, by the 2nd of February, the payment would have been done. Is that okay?

9/1/24, 5:06 PM - +27 81 002 7935: That can be arranged @919650537098
9/1/24, 5:07 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright, Let me ask the academic board if we can provide you extension till 31st of January, but I want to be sure that you will complete the payment by this date, Are you sure right ?

11/1/24, 1:03 PM - +27 81 002 7935: As I mentioned, I get paid on the last day of the month. So I won’t have money to pay before the 28th
11/1/24, 1:04 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Yes, I do remember that you mentioned that you will get the amount by the month end. But I am not understanding why you have not planned your finances as you already know the amount and the due date for the remaining payment, right ?
11/1/24, 1:08 PM - +27 81 002 7935: Some unforeseen events occurred which caused us to go out of budget

11/1/24, 1:13 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I respect your thoughts that you don't want to share the concern with us, but you know in order to give you extension we have to represent the strong case in front of officials only then I can help you, right ?
