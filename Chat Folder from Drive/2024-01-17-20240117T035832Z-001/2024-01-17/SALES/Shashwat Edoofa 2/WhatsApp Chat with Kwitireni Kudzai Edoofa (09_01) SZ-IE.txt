16/01/24, 11:46 am - +263 77 472 0019: My name is Kwitireni Joe, born on 15 June 1977 in remote areas of Chipinge. I am 45 years old. I come from a humble family of three children who are all grown up. I am the last born. I grew up determined to go to school in order to have a better future. I have none Ordinary Level Certificate attained in 1997 at Ngezi Secondary School in Mhondoro. 

I am married to Elizabeth Kwitireni who is 40 years old and we are now staying in Gweru. I am a policeman and having difficulties in paying fees for tertiary education for Kudzai. I have four children, Kudzai being the eldest, followed by Nokutenda who is in Form 1, Kunashe who is in Grade 5 and Kudzwaishe who is one year old. 

I am a parent who value education and also believe in that my children should exceed the level of education that I attained as their parent. This means my children will compete with others in the global community to solve community problem to make it safe for us all. 

Kudzai Kwitireni is a male student who is obedient and hardworking. He worked hard during the two year program in A Level Mathematics, Physics and Chemistry and he managed 13 points out of the possible 15. His strengths are that he is quiet, does not involve many friends and well behaved which means he can do his work and accomplish tasks to the best of his ability. He is a shy person which may lead him in missing social issues that need one to be at gatherings.
16/01/24, 12:17 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Your commitment to serving as a policeman is truly commendable and deserves high praise. As a member of the law enforcement community, you play a vital role in upholding safety, maintaining order, and protecting the well-being of the community. Your dedication to ensuring the security of others demonstrates a deep sense of responsibility and courage, contributing significantly to the overall welfare of society, Mr. Joe! Kudzai's achievements and qualities are truly commendable, and it's evident that he is an exceptional student with a bright future ahead. His remarkable academic success in A Level Mathematics, Physics, and Chemistry, securing 13 points out of 15, speaks volumes about his dedication, hard work, and intellectual prowess. His disciplined and quiet demeanor, combined with his ability to work independently and accomplish tasks to the best of his ability, showcases not only academic excellence but also a strong work ethic. Kudzai's obedience, well-behaved nature, and focused approach set him apart, reflecting his commitment to his studies and personal development. Despite his shy disposition, his achievements demonstrate a resilience and determination that will undoubtedly serve him well in his future endeavors! Could you kindly shed light on the educational background of his siblings, please?
16/01/24, 12:35 pm - +263 77 472 0019: Kudzai is the first born, Nokutenda is the second  and she is in Form 1 at Fletcher High as a day schooler, after attaining six units at Grade 7 national exams.

16/01/24, 1:24 pm - +263 77 472 0019: Kudzai was a day schooler and his fees at Chaplin High School was USD 120 per term and I am the one responsible.
16/01/24, 1:38 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Since pursuing higher education is a significant undertaking that demands both mental and financial support, may I know who will be financially supporting Kudzai's education abroad?
16/01/24, 2:15 pm - +263 77 472 0019: I will be responsible
16/01/24, 2:19 pm - +263 77 472 0019: I will make it so that he attains his dreams
16/01/24, 2:32 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Mr. Joe and Mrs. Elizabeth. You are extraordinary parents, consistently providing unwavering support, guidance, and encouragement, and your dedication to Kudzai's well-being is truly admirable!
16/01/24, 2:50 pm - +263 77 472 0019: Thank you, I think it's the wish of every parent to see his/her offspring flying high with others.

16/01/24, 3:37 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I truly admire your vision, Mr. Joe! Exposure to foreign tertiary education offers numerous advantages. It broadens students' horizons by introducing them to diverse cultures and perspectives, improving language skills, and providing a global outlook. They gain access to world-class academic institutions, form international networks, and develop invaluable personal and professional skills. This experience fosters personal growth, enhances career prospects, and cultivates global citizenship. In essence, studying abroad is a transformative journey that equips students with the knowledge, skills, and perspective needed to thrive in our interconnected world!
16/01/24, 3:37 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Could you kindly send his O-Level results as well, please?
16/01/24, 3:51 pm - +263 77 472 0019: He is yet to collect the original. I will do so when he collects
16/01/24, 4:04 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Thank you for bringing that to my attention, Mr. Joe. Could you kindly brief me regarding his career aspiration more vividly, please?
16/01/24, 4:22 pm - +263 77 472 0019: He is interested in the medical area and engineering. He have always wanted to be Neuro Surgeon, a person who deals with the nervous system. He has been inspired by the fact that there are a few of these professionals in the country. If he becomes one, he might be of help to the community. It is not offered here in Zimbabwe and that motivated him to look elsewhere where he may start and maybe become a true reflection of his being.
16/01/24, 4:27 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Noted. Well, Mr. Joe, could you please share why Kudzai didn't pursue Biology in his A level?

I believe it is a very crucial science/ medical subject, isn't it?
16/01/24, 4:55 pm - +263 77 472 0019: Sure it is crucial. He did it at O Level and he chose not to do it because of lack of career guidance. When he got a place at Chaplin I was committed at work away from home.
16/01/24, 4:56 pm - +263 77 472 0019: He has seen the mistake but still want to pursue that if it's permitted
16/01/24, 4:57 pm - +263 77 472 0019: If it is not then he may opt for other degrees where he qualifies
16/01/24, 5:22 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: May I know whether he is interested in the pharmaceutical industry, please?
16/01/24, 5:34 pm - +263 77 472 0019: He is but he wants to know if there are other degrees on offer where he qualifies. Maybe he may choose from the ok list
16/01/24, 5:37 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
16/01/24, 5:39 pm - +263 77 472 0019: Thank you have a good night.
