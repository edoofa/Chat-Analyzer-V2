Moreover, please mention the year of completion of A level as well?
21/12/23, 1:59 pm - +263 71 300 2882: From my research medical studies abroad primarily offer a chance to widen one’s perspective, and be familiar with the international medical field. All of which can give me an edge in the arena considering that practicing medicine is a global career. And it would also offer an opportunity to see more of the world generally. 


As I have always looked up to my relatives from abroad pulling more of the weight of the whole family's difficult struggles all pushing me to become a better self to be able to pull my own weight and help the coming generations of my family to live a better life.
This would be the main motivation to working hard
21/12/23, 1:59 pm - +263 71 300 2882: Year of completion of A level is 2023
21/12/23, 2:00 pm - +263 71 300 2882: I will arrange for the scanned pictures as soon as I can
21/12/23, 2:19 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I truly admire your vision, Victor! Exposure to foreign tertiary education offers numerous advantages. It broadens students' horizons by introducing them to diverse cultures and perspectives, improving language skills, and providing a global outlook. They gain access to world-class academic institutions, form international networks, and develop invaluable personal and professional skills. This experience fosters personal growth, enhances career prospects, and cultivates global citizenship. In essence, studying abroad is a transformative journey that equips students with the knowledge, skills, and perspective needed to thrive in our interconnected world!
21/12/23, 2:20 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I will be waiting for your response, Victor.

On a positive note, I am here to begin our session
Are you ready?
16/01/24, 9:10 am - +263 71 300 2882: Not yet can we begin at 10:30am
16/01/24, 9:18 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I hope you are having a wonderful day, Victor!
16/01/24, 9:18 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: May I know whether there is a specific reason for that, please?
16/01/24, 9:24 am - +263 71 300 2882: I want to go and collect my hard copy of the A level certificate at my school, and network may falter as i go there and back. I wouldn't want to seem ignorant to our session by replying late.
16/01/24, 9:37 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Certainly, Victor. Let us connect at *10:30 A.M. CAT* to resume your session. I will be looking forward to your response.
16/01/24, 1:55 pm - +263 71 300 2882: I'm now ready to connect
16/01/24, 2:05 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Noted. Well, Victor, could you please share why you didn't pursue Physics in your A level?

I believe it is a very crucial science subject, isn't it?
16/01/24, 2:09 pm - +263 71 300 2882: I was pursuing all four subjects at the beginning of my Grade 12th year but the weight/pressure became intense and as uninformed as I was then and with poor career guidance. I had believed writting Biology was the best way forward only to discover later that physics is a mandatory subject to pursue what I want abroad.
16/01/24, 2:10 pm - +263 71 300 2882: It is a crucial science
16/01/24, 2:28 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, if you had researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any *Healthcare course* in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*. whereas if they want to study any *Engineering Course* then they should have *Physics and Maths* in their A level mandatorily.
16/01/24, 2:37 pm - +263 71 300 2882: Okay soo with my combination wah courses can India offer
16/01/24, 2:38 pm - +263 71 300 2882: And is there a way to get the same qualification some other way like getting a diploma first

16/01/24, 4:15 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: B.Sc. Medical Laboratory Technology

A *B.Sc. in Medical Laboratory Technology* is a 3-year undergraduate program that focuses on the skills and knowledge required to work in the field of clinical laboratory science. Medical laboratory technologists play a crucial role in the healthcare system by conducting various laboratory tests and analyses that assist in the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of diseases.

During the program, students are trained in various laboratory techniques, sample collection, testing procedures, and result interpretation. They learn how to handle and analyze different types of biological samples, such as blood, urine, tissue, and body fluids. *The curriculum also includes theoretical and practical courses in subjects like microbiology, biochemistry, hematology, immunology, and pathology.*

*Upon completion of the program, graduates can pursue careers as Laboratory Technicians, Laboratory Managers, Medical Officers, Research Associates, Medical Record Technicians, Resident Medical Officers, Lab Assistants, Laboratory Testing Managers, or even pursue teaching positions as Associate Professors or Lecturers in the field of medical laboratory science.*

Job opportunities for medical laboratory technologists can be found in a variety of settings, including hospitals, healthcare clinics, medical pathology laboratories, research laboratories, urologists' offices, and other healthcare facilities. They work closely with healthcare professionals, such as doctors and pathologists, to provide accurate and timely laboratory test results that contribute to patient care and treatment decisions.

*Overall, a B.Sc. in Medical Laboratory Technology provides graduates with the skills and knowledge necessary to perform laboratory tests, contribute to medical research, and make a valuable impact in the field of healthcare.*
