Also the universities linked with the program helps one to easily get a job


Also one will be self relient since you will learn both theory and skills to survive
12/01/24, 10:31 am - Keshav Edoofa: Very well Oliver duly noted!
12/01/24, 10:32 am - Keshav Edoofa: let me elaborate further about Edoofa to you
12/01/24, 10:32 am - Keshav Edoofa: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
12/01/24, 10:32 am - Keshav Edoofa: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
12/01/24, 10:36 am - Keshav Edoofa: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.

12/01/24, 10:38 am - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>
12/01/24, 10:38 am - Keshav Edoofa: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
12/01/24, 10:41 am - +263 71 830 8198: Yes true
12/01/24, 10:45 am - Keshav Edoofa: That is great Oliver
12/01/24, 10:45 am - +263 71 830 8198: Ye sir
12/01/24, 10:45 am - Keshav Edoofa: Okay so Oliver, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.
12/01/24, 10:46 am - Keshav Edoofa: Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
12/01/24, 10:48 am - +263 71 830 8198: Yes
12/01/24, 10:48 am - +263 71 830 8198: 100% sure
12/01/24, 10:49 am - Keshav Edoofa: Thats very commendable of you Oliver, Kudos!
12/01/24, 10:49 am - +263 71 830 8198: No problem
12/01/24, 10:49 am - Keshav Edoofa: Alright so Oliver, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.

I would like to know you better as a student, so please go ahead, and tell me a bit about yourself, your education, what you wish to study, your strengths, your weaknesses, your hobbies, and a detailed description of your family background, *Where do your parents work (Place) in your country or any other country that they have relocated to due to work promises?  Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work) since I honestly don't know a lot about you?*
12/01/24, 11:01 am - +263 71 830 8198: My name is Oliver Tanaka Magaya I'm 19 years old. I finished my A level studies last year and am currently looking forward for my results this year in 2 weeks time. I got 6As 5Bs for my O level (GCSE LEVEL).

12/01/24, 1:14 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Duly noted Oliver
12/01/24, 1:14 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*
12/01/24, 1:17 pm - +263 71 830 8198: Noted
12/01/24, 1:19 pm - Keshav Edoofa: So as you want to pursue aerospace engineering shall I brief you about the course *Bachelor of Technology in Aerospace Engineering*?
12/01/24, 1:32 pm - +263 71 830 8198: Yes pliz

12/01/24, 1:33 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Did you understand the course?
12/01/24, 1:38 pm - +263 71 830 8198: Yes but l need to understand. If l may ask between the 3 which one is best
Not in terms of passion but in terms of job security
12/01/24, 1:40 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Can you please elaborate what do you wish to ask Oliver?
12/01/24, 1:42 pm - +263 71 830 8198: Thanks the for the  clarification pertaining aerospace engineering


But l was just asking a casual question that l may have chosen aerospace engineering but what other good options can be for an engineering student
12/01/24, 1:48 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Sure Oliver I am here to guide you in opting for the best course in your interest and I will support you throughout the counselling session so that can opt for the course and receive the maximum scholarship that best aligns with your interests and as well as that offers the best opportunities out there
12/01/24, 1:48 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Oliver, looking at your interests and passion for aero planes and aeronautics, let me share with you that we do offer *Aerospace Engineering* but as your counselor I would like to highlight a few parameters

This is a niche course that has a higher cost of education compared to other branches of engineering and the quantum of scholarship offered is low

If you opt for this branch, your scope of career opportunities will be confined to the branch of Aerospace/Aeronautical itself. At the same time, if you opt for a degree like *Mechanical Engineering*, it can help to bridge you to Aeronautical, Aerospace, Automotive, etc at the same time helps to fulfill your interests to solve challenges, to bring innovations, and at the same time offering a wider spectrum of career opportunities as Mechanical Engineering is known as the mother of Engineering!
12/01/24, 1:54 pm - +263 71 830 8198: So to start with aerospace engineering from scratch is it a good idea or
12/01/24, 2:10 pm - Keshav Edoofa: See Oliver as your counselor i will guide you to the best course that will down the years of line will get you the maximum opportunities
12/01/24, 2:12 pm - Keshav Edoofa: In my opinion, opting for such a niche course like Aerospace Engineering will provide you with limited opportunities ahead, and on the other hand if you opt for Mechanical Engineering then it will open a plethora of opportunities for you ahead.
Even if you pursue Mechanical Engineering in your undergraduate you will be able to pursue Aerospace Engineering in your masters
12/01/24, 2:14 pm - Keshav Edoofa: So it is best for you if opt for Mechanical Engineering and as your counselor I want you to succeed ahead with having maximum opportunities at your hand and get the maximum scholarship to pursue Mechanical Engineering under our Edoofa scholarship program
12/01/24, 2:16 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Also shall I brief you about Btech Mechanical Engineering in detail?
12/01/24, 2:22 pm - +263 71 830 8198: Yes
12/01/24, 2:23 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Before that Oliver did you comprehend what I told you? 
Also Kindly give me your views now regarding the same
12/01/24, 2:25 pm - +263 71 830 8198: Yea but as a matter of l was opting for these 3
1 Aeronautical engineering
2 petroleum engineering
3. Engineering
12/01/24, 2:27 pm - +263 71 830 8198: I heard you but l was considering if l can get a counselling pertaining those 3
12/01/24, 3:01 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Good Afternoon Oliver!
I was busy in a meeting with the Acaedmic Board Of Edoofa
Let us kindly resume your session for today
12/01/24, 3:01 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I hope you are available right now
12/01/24, 3:04 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Regarding your 3rd point Oliver, 
Engineering in general is a very vast domain that contains more than 50 specializations. It is not at all advisable that I explain every branch of engineering to you as you will get further confused and clueless regarding the course to pursue
12/01/24, 3:11 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Regarding Petroleum Engineering Oliver, see field of petroleum engineering is a very niche branch of engineering and a highly specialized field.
The scope of petroleum engineering is gradually declining over the years and continues to be so. Petroleum engineering jobs and opportunities are very limited and to only specific countries in the Middle East now and it keeps on decreasing with time.

Therefore Oliver it is not very advisable to pursue petroleum engineering in such a scenario
12/01/24, 3:15 pm - Keshav Edoofa: As you told me about your interests and aspirations regarding Aerospace engineering I truly understand it Oliver but you must know Aerospace Engineering is a sub-domain of Mechanical Engineering.

All the job opportunities that exist for aerospace engineering apply to mechanical engineering as well but certainly not vice-versa, thus it is advised to a student to pursue mechanical engineering and if they truly discover their interest in aerospace engineering they always have the scope to pursue aerospace engineering in their masters!
12/01/24, 3:15 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I hope I cleared your doubts regarding the same?
12/01/24, 3:16 pm - +263 71 830 8198: For 3rd option l was suggesting civil engineering
12/01/24, 3:16 pm - +263 71 830 8198: Yes thank you
12/01/24, 3:16 pm - +263 71 830 8198: I need clarification pertaining that
12/01/24, 3:18 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Sure Oliver I will explain Mechanical as well as Civil engineering too in detail
12/01/24, 3:18 pm - Keshav Edoofa: ​*B.Tech Civil Engineering: What is it About?*

Civil engineering is one of the oldest engineering disciplines in the world. Civil engineering, until a few decades back, was a much sought after course among Indian students, but lately has been sidelined due to the software and IT boom. However with the increasing need to develop and maintain India’s infrastructure, which is lagging in all aspects, this field is bouncing back strongly.

There are options for higher studies after the completion of B.Tech. course. Students can pursue Master’s degree in specialized course. Master of Technology (M.Tech.) in Civil engineering and other allied branches like-

*Structural Engineering*
*Architectural Engineering*
*Geotechnical Engineering*
*Environmental Engineering etc.*

*B.Tech Civil Engineering: Who should opt?*

Before you decide to pursue your undergraduate studies in this field, it is important to understand that Civil engineering is not just about buildings and bridges. If you are under the assumption that all that civil engineers do is wear a yellow helmet and supervise workers in construction sites, then you are yet to understand the true capacity of this field. 


*Career aspects*

In these cases, you will have to hunt for a core engineering job all by yourself through off-campus placements. Creating strong professional networks, developing a great resume with stellar GPA and doing impressive projects and internships will help you secure a job in one of the core civil engineering companies.

Also, civil engineers find work not just in construction industry, but also in other industries such as oil and energy, transportation, petroleum, environmental, power and electric utilities, chemical etc where infrastructure projects and construction facilities are involved. Some students transition to software, consulting or banking as they feel that salary and growth prospects are better in these sectors.
12/01/24, 3:19 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Did you get clarity regarding civil engineering now Oliver? <This message was edited>
12/01/24, 3:23 pm - +263 71 830 8198: Yes thank you
12/01/24, 3:26 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Shall I also brief you regarding *B.Tech. Mechanical Engineering*?
12/01/24, 3:26 pm - +263 71 830 8198: Yes l guess let's continue
12/01/24, 3:28 pm - Keshav Edoofa: *B.Tech. Mechanical Engineering* is a 4-year undergraduate course

First thing any engineering aspirant considers while choosing a branch in Engineering is placement aspect and the course very well caters to it. A few questions which arise when admissions to engineering colleges commence include the branch in demand, highest paid engineering graduates and others such.  Apart from this palcement criteria, there are some other parameters which should be considered while choosing a discipline like- what are the research opportunities, what is scope of career growth etc.

Mechanical Engineering is the evergreen branch of engineering. Market scenario and demand of engineering graduates change every year but the demand of mechanical engineering degree will never be obsolete. Mechanical engineering graduates can find placements in almost every sector, right from construction sector to steel industry and from automobile to software.

Following are the sub disciplines that are associated with mechanical engineering:

*Production Engineering*
*Industrial Engineering*
*Manufacturing Engineering*
*Automobile Engineering*
*Artificial Intelligence*

The field of mechanical engineering can be thought of as a collection of many mechanical engineering science disciplines. Several of these subdisciplines which are typically taught at the undergraduate level are listed below, with a brief explanation and the most common application of each. Some of these subdisciplines are unique to mechanical engineering, while others are a combination of mechanical engineering and one or more other disciplines. Most work that a mechanical engineer does uses skills and techniques from several of these subdisciplines, as well as specialized subdisciplines. Specialized subdisciplines, as used in this article, are more likely to be the subject of graduate studies or on-the-job training than undergraduate research. Several specialized sub disciplines are discussed in this section.

*Mechanics* 

Mechanics is, in the most general sense, the study of forces and their effect upon matter. Typically, engineering mechanics is used to analyze and predict the acceleration and deformation (both elastic and plastic) of objects under known forces (also called loads) or stresses. Subdisciplines of mechanics include Statics, the study of non-moving bodies under known loads, how forces affect static bodies Dynamics the study of how forces affect moving bodies. Dynamics includes kinematics (about movement, velocity, and acceleration) and kinetics (about forces and resulting accelerations). Mechanics of materials, the study of how different materials deform under various types of stress Fluid mechanics, the study of how fluids react to forces Kinematics, the study of the motion of bodies (objects) and systems (groups of objects), while ignoring the forces that cause the motion. Kinematics is often used in the design and analysis of mechanisms. Continuum mechanics, a method of applying mechanics that assumes that objects are continuous (rather than discrete) Mechanical engineers typically use mechanics in the design or analysis phases of engineering. If the engineering project were the design of a vehicle, statics might be employed to design the frame of the vehicle, in order to evaluate where the stresses will be most intense. Dynamics might be used when designing the car's engine, to evaluate the forces in the pistons and cams as the engine cycles. Mechanics of materials might be used to choose appropriate materials for the frame and engine. Fluid mechanics might be used to design a ventilation system for the vehicle (see HVAC), or to design the intake system for the engine

*Mechatronics and Robotics*

Mechatronics is a combination of mechanics and electronics. It is an interdisciplinary branch of mechanical engineering, electrical engineering and software engineering that is concerned with integrating electrical and mechanical engineering to create hybrid systems. In this way, machines can be automated through the use of electric motors, servo-mechanisms, and other electrical systems in conjunction with special software. A common example of a mechatronics system is a CD-ROM drive. Mechanical systems open and close the drive, spin the CD and move the laser, while an optical system reads the data on the CD and converts it to bits. Integrated software controls the process and communicates the contents of the CD to the computer.

Robotics is the application of mechatronics to create robots, which are often used in industry to perform tasks that are dangerous, unpleasant, or repetitive. These robots may be of any shape and size, but all are preprogrammed and interact physically with the world. To create a robot, an engineer typically employs kinematics (to determine the robot's range of motion) and mechanics (to determine the stresses within the robot).

Robots are used extensively in industrial engineering. They allow businesses to save money on labor, perform tasks that are either too dangerous or too precise for humans to perform them economically, and to ensure better quality. Many companies employ assembly lines of robots, especially in Automotive Industries and some factories are so robotized that they can run by themselves. Outside the factory, robots have been employed in bomb disposal, space exploration, and many other fields. Robots are also sold for various residential applications, from recreation to domestic applications.

*Thermodynamics and Thermo-science*

Thermodynamics is an applied science used in several branches of engineering, including mechanical and chemical engineering. At its simplest, thermodynamics is the study of energy, its use and transformation through a system. Typically, engineering thermodynamics is concerned with changing energy from one form to another. As an example, automotive engines convert chemical energy (enthalpy) from the fuel into heat, and then into mechanical work that eventually turns the wheels.

Thermodynamics principles are used by mechanical engineers in the fields of heat transfer, thermofluids, and energy conversion. Mechanical engineers use thermo-science to design engines and power plants, heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems, heat exchangers, heat sinks, radiators, refrigeration, insulation, and others.

*Design and drafting*

Drafting or technical drawing is the means by which mechanical engineers design products and create instructions for manufacturing parts. A technical drawing can be a computer model or hand-drawn schematic showing all the dimensions necessary to manufacture a part, as well as assembly notes, a list of required materials, and other pertinent information. A U.S. mechanical engineer or skilled worker who creates technical drawings may be referred to as a drafter or draftsman. Drafting has historically been a two-dimensional process, but computer-aided design (CAD) programs now allow the designer to create in three dimensions.

Instructions for manufacturing a part must be fed to the necessary machinery, either manually, through programmed instructions, or through the use of a computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) or combined CAD/CAM program. Optionally, an engineer may also manually manufacture a part using the technical drawings. However, with the advent of computer numerically controlled (CNC) manufacturing, parts can now be fabricated without the need for constant technician input. Manually manufactured parts generally consist of spray coatings, surface finishes, and other processes that cannot economically or practically be done by a machine.

Drafting is used in nearly every subdiscipline of mechanical engineering, and by many other branches of engineering and architecture. Three-dimensional models created using CAD software are also commonly used in finite element analysis (FEA) and computational fluid dynamics (CFD).

12/01/24, 3:34 pm - +263 71 830 8198: Understood
12/01/24, 3:36 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Now that I have detailed you about 3 different courses, which engineering do you believe is best suited to you and your aspirations? Also do tell me that if you are provided with this career option in that particular engineering how do you see yourself 5 years after the completion of this course and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
12/01/24, 3:38 pm - +263 71 830 8198: I would opt for Mechanical engineering first

And then l bridge to the area of my speciality
12/01/24, 3:42 pm - Keshav Edoofa: That is a very bright decision, Oliver, I am sure you would do wonders pursuing Mechanical Engineering and make your goals come true.

Also I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations,

However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

Are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way in order to transform your career dear?
12/01/24, 3:45 pm - +263 71 830 8198: Yes l will not miss even l
12/01/24, 3:46 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Bravo! Oliver
12/01/24, 3:46 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
12/01/24, 4:18 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Well Oliver, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you *tomorrow again at 9AM CAT* to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care and do watch the video I am sharing below.

Have a good day ahead. 
God Bless You! <This message was edited>

12/01/24, 5:49 pm - +263 71 830 8198: Litterally in our country the economy is failing everything. There is industry or any job so to  off. Even after finishing your tertiary education one still will not get a job
13/01/24, 9:08 am - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: Good Morning @263718308198
13/01/24, 9:08 am - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: *I am Mr. Piyush, The Head of Admission at Edoofa.* 

I have been evaluating your responses in the counseling session with your counselor.

There was an emergency because of which Mr Keshav is a bit occupied
13/01/24, 9:33 am - +263 71 830 8198: No problem
13/01/24, 9:37 am - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: Yesterday Mr Keshav shared a video with you, did you happen to watch it?
13/01/24, 9:56 am - +263 71 830 8198: Yes sir
13/01/24, 10:02 am - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: That is great Oliver, so esterday you shared about why you wish to study abroad and not in Zimbabwe, could you please elaborate your answer as well?
13/01/24, 10:17 am - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: @263718308198 are we connected?
13/01/24, 10:17 am - +263 71 830 8198: Yes
13/01/24, 10:18 am - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: I asked you a question, can you answer that please?
13/01/24, 10:19 am - +263 71 830 8198: Studying in zimbabwe. One has limited chances of easily getting a job
Almost youths of my age are already losing the zeal to continue since there are no job opportunities
Also currently tertiary education is now very expensive compared to other countries where one can easily get sponsorship
13/01/24, 10:21 am - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: I can understand Oliver, you see, during my stay in Zimbabwe from March to June 2023, I gained valuable insights. Many Zimbabwean students, including those I interacted with and those who shared their experiences, highlighted the financial challenges of pursuing higher education. Tertiary education expenses in Zimbabwe can amount to approximately $3000-$4000 annually.

While the cost of education remains within the range of $1200-$1500 per year, the cost of living is notably high. Even a basic meal of Sadza and curry can cost a student $1 per serving. This means around $1100 is allocated solely for food, with additional essential costs such as internet, accommodation, and transportation pushing the total to $2000-$2500 per year.

During my visit, I encountered Zimbabwean students who had applied for the Edoofa Program in 2018-2019 but hadn't proceeded due to the lure of quick earnings within the country. However, this year, they shared their hardships, with some holding prestigious degrees from institutions like UZ, MSU, and HIT, now working as petrol attendants or mobile/laptop repair technicians. Others faced even greater challenges, resorting to selling Ecocash, Simcards, or vegetables.

Observing this scenario, it's evident that many of them regret not seizing the opportunity earlier. I understand the harsh realities they face.

Here are a few pictures of my interactions with students and their parents during my time there.
13/01/24, 10:24 am - +263 71 830 8198: Ok
13/01/24, 10:26 am - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: <Media omitted>
13/01/24, 10:26 am - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: <Media omitted>
13/01/24, 11:40 am - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: So Oliver, if you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
14/01/24, 11:22 pm - +263 71 830 8198: Sorry for the late reply
The network coverage was facing a difficult situation
14/01/24, 11:22 pm - +263 71 830 8198: First l will link up some of my friends to the Edoofan program to get better education like l did
Secondly will help some thriving institutions with the needed resources to help fund their programmes
15/01/24, 9:25 am - Keshav Edoofa: Very well Oliver, I must tell you that these are some great insights
15/01/24, 9:27 am - Keshav Edoofa: I appreciate your sense of hardworking for your community Oliver, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?
15/01/24, 9:36 am - +263 71 830 8198: Yes l agree
15/01/24, 9:38 am - Keshav Edoofa: Since you are aware that through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years?
15/01/24, 10:11 am - Keshav Edoofa: So now would you like to ask anything?

So now shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?
15/01/24, 4:21 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I was expecting your response, but it seems you are occupied at the moment, so I will have to schedule your session for *tomorrow at 9:00 AM CAT* as my working hours are over for the day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning. 

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above-mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
15/01/24, 9:55 pm - +263 71 830 8198: Why is it like that
15/01/24, 9:55 pm - +263 71 830 8198: Yes pleas
16/01/24, 9:22 am - Keshav Edoofa: Good Morning Oliver
16/01/24, 9:22 am - Keshav Edoofa: I am here for us to continue with your application, so shall we start?
16/01/24, 12:40 pm - +263 71 830 8198: Resend messages
16/01/24, 1:01 pm - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: Good Afternoon Oliver
16/01/24, 3:29 pm - +263 71 830 8198: Afternoon
