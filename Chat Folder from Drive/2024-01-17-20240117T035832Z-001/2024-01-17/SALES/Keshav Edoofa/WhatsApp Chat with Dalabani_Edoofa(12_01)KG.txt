*I am Mr Keshav, Career Counsellor at Edoofa.*

We have received an application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program for Walid

I hope I have contacted the right person.

I would like you to come online so that I could discuss with you the form you submitted online and what I was able to understand from the same!
15/01/24, 8:57 am - +263 77 280 5963: Morning to you
15/01/24, 8:58 am - +263 78 878 7885: Good morning Mr Keshav
15/01/24, 8:59 am - Keshav Edoofa: I shall proceed by briefing you about the Edoofa program in detail
15/01/24, 8:59 am - Keshav Edoofa: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
15/01/24, 8:59 am - Keshav Edoofa: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
15/01/24, 9:00 am - Keshav Edoofa: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.

15/01/24, 9:09 am - +263 78 878 7885: ✅
15/01/24, 9:09 am - Keshav Edoofa: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
15/01/24, 9:10 am - +263 77 280 5963: Impressive Mr Kashev 👏👏👏
15/01/24, 9:12 am - +263 78 878 7885: Yes sir
15/01/24, 9:12 am - +263 78 878 7885: Yes sir
15/01/24, 9:13 am - Keshav Edoofa: I am glad you are following the session, Mrs. Aisha, parents involvement motivates the student and me as a counselor
15/01/24, 9:13 am - Keshav Edoofa: Great Walid
15/01/24, 9:14 am - Keshav Edoofa: Okay so Walid, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
15/01/24, 9:15 am - +263 78 878 7885: Yes Sir I do
15/01/24, 9:16 am - Keshav Edoofa: Thats the spirit Walid!
15/01/24, 9:17 am - Keshav Edoofa: Alright so , now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.

I would like to know you better as a student, so please go ahead, and tell me a bit about yourself, your education, what you wish to study, your strengths, your weaknesses, your hobbies, and a detailed description of your family background, *Where do your parents work (Place) in your country or any other country that they have relocated to due to work promises?  Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work) since I honestly don't know a lot about you?*
15/01/24, 9:20 am - +263 77 554 4486: Good morning to you too 
All noted and we're following.
15/01/24, 9:21 am - Keshav Edoofa: That is admirable Mr. Swadiki
15/01/24, 9:36 am - +263 78 878 7885: Well I began my high school in 2017 at Iqra Academy in waterfalls where I was doing both academic and religious studies. I completed my O level there in 2021. The school did not offer Sciences at A level so I then got enrolled at the  Speciss study center under a crash program which aimed to complete the A level course in under one year but of course with allowance to those who felt they were not ready thus my completing the  A level course in October 2022 with the hope and  desire to study Electrical engineering at University level. One of my strengths is that I'm quite punctual and  I require minimum teacher input and supervision . I however do have a challenge when it comes to expressing myself   in situations requiring elaboration.
15/01/24, 9:52 am - Keshav Edoofa: I really appreciate how sincere you were in expressing yourself, Walid. Your determination to excel in your studies is truly commendable and reflects a strong sense of responsibility toward securing a bright future for yourself and your family.
15/01/24, 9:53 am - +263 78 878 7885: As for my family, we are currently staying in Mazowe, Mashonaland Province, Zimbabawe. My father used to work here at Mazowe Mine as an engineering manager but is no longer working due to certain company reasons and issues. He specifically studied electrical engineering . My mother is rather self employed.  She sells a few things from home depending on the demand and market.
15/01/24, 9:53 am - +263 78 878 7885: As for hobbies, I enjoy watching and playing soccer.
15/01/24, 9:54 am - Keshav Edoofa: Can you please elaborate on your parent's background, education level, and profession?
15/01/24, 9:54 am - +263 78 878 7885: Thank you sir
15/01/24, 9:56 am - +263 78 878 7885: We are having a bit of a network challenge, but we are managing
15/01/24, 9:57 am - Keshav Edoofa: I completely understand the challenges Walid
15/01/24, 10:02 am - +263 78 878 7885: My father did his tertiary education here in Zimbabwe and has a diploma in Electrical Engineering. My mother did her primary and secondary  studies in South Africa and went to an Islamic college there as well.
15/01/24, 10:04 am - Keshav Edoofa: If I may know who has supported your tertiary education and who will financially support your higher education as well?
15/01/24, 10:06 am - +263 78 878 7885: My parents sir
15/01/24, 10:09 am - Keshav Edoofa: Very Well Walid, I would like to say Mr Swadiki and Mrs Aisha are amazing parents and I really admire the support they are providing to you
15/01/24, 10:09 am - Keshav Edoofa: Are they prepared with some financial planning for your higher education abroad? <This message was edited>
15/01/24, 10:13 am - +263 78 878 7885: Thank you sir. They really are supportive
15/01/24, 10:13 am - +263 78 878 7885: Yes sir.
15/01/24, 10:13 am - Keshav Edoofa: Very well noted Walid
15/01/24, 10:13 am - Keshav Edoofa: Now can you shed some more light on your siblings and what they do?
15/01/24, 10:20 am - +263 78 878 7885: My parents have 4 children of whom I'm the oldest; all boys. The second born,Moosa, is currently awaiting his O level results at the same school that I went. The third is in grade 4 at a school here in Mazowe . and the last born started grade one this year here in Mazowe as well
15/01/24, 10:25 am - Keshav Edoofa: Duly Noted Walid!
15/01/24, 10:26 am - Keshav Edoofa: As we proceed ahead, I have a question, during your introduction you mentioned you would like to study Electrical Engineering could you please share what motivates you behind this field of study?
15/01/24, 10:31 am - +263 77 554 4486: We're committed to make sure our son completes his tertiary studies and accomplishes his dreams.
15/01/24, 10:39 am - +263 78 878 7885: Well my greatest muse sir is my father. I have seen him work and apply his knowledge and experience in different types of situations and environments and thus developed a desire to be like him. Apart from this, I have come to like this field of study also because it also requires more physical input and the ability to be mentally awake hence my desire to meet the challenges along the way.I feel  Electrical engineering will push my limits in almost all aspects sir.
15/01/24, 10:41 am - Keshav Edoofa: That is really admirable Walid, I have confidence that you are an exceptionally diligent student, and you will undoubtedly demonstrate your capabilities if given the right guidance!
15/01/24, 10:42 am - +263 78 878 7885: Thank you sir , I appreciate
15/01/24, 10:42 am - Keshav Edoofa: Alright so now can you share your O Level and A level results for evaluation?
15/01/24, 10:52 am - +263 78 878 7885: <Media omitted>
15/01/24, 10:53 am - +263 78 878 7885: <Media omitted>
15/01/24, 10:59 am - Keshav Edoofa: So now shall I brief you about *Bachelor of Technology in Electrical Engineering*?
15/01/24, 11:00 am - +263 78 878 7885: Sure thing sir
15/01/24, 11:03 am - Keshav Edoofa: *Bachelor of Technology in Electrical Engineering* is a 4 years degree course. Electrical engineering is one of the most sought-after branches of engineering

Electrical engineering is the study and application of electricity, electronics and electromagnetism for the development and maintenance of electrical and electronics equipment. Electrical Engineering course study includes Circuit analysis, machines & drive system, Power System, Control system, Power electronics, Utilization etc. The main focus of the course will be on industrial requirement of ‘Electrical engineering’.

The scope for students of B. Tech Electrical Engineering is very high. There are two options available for them either they can join higher education after this course or they can join their professional career as per skills. At present, electrical engineers have great demand in the market.
 
An objective of this course is to ensure the success of the students for a long time. Students can develop their electrical skills and abilities with the study of this course. They also can improve abilities of professional attitude, effective communication skills as well.

Electrical Engineering has very good career opportunities in professional career such as all power generation, transmission; distribution companies can offer them a very good remuneration as per their skills. Apart from that other sectors like MNC companies, IT companies, steel, cement, fertilizer, petrochemical, shipping, traction, automobile companies etc. can give them best job offers with high salary packages.
15/01/24, 11:04 am - Keshav Edoofa: Did you understand the course?
15/01/24, 11:08 am - +263 78 878 7885: Yes
15/01/24, 11:09 am - Keshav Edoofa: Since you have understood the course properly can you now tell me that if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself 5 years after the completion of this course and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
15/01/24, 11:26 am - +263 78 878 7885: Well I came to realize that technically should not chase success but the opposite should happen and  I intend to work with this belief throughout school and after. So by then I would like to believe I would have made a difference and impact on others positively. Edoofa promises to enhance the  learner's skill set  and employability so if could maximize on this then I would be in a position to be my own employer and offer the same to others with, of course, room for improvement and expansion.
15/01/24, 11:27 am - Keshav Edoofa: Bravo Walid , i really appreciate your understanding and clarity
15/01/24, 11:27 am - Keshav Edoofa: I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations,

However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

Are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way inorder to transform your career dear?
15/01/24, 11:31 am - +263 78 878 7885: I am aware sir and I have settled for this career path with the desire to excel
15/01/24, 11:36 am - Keshav Edoofa: Very well Walid!
15/01/24, 11:36 am - Keshav Edoofa: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
15/01/24, 12:05 pm - +263 78 878 7885: Studying abroad will  result in the forming of relationships with people from different countries and cultures and also it will create an environment with much greater competition which will help push my own limits. I also believe that there are better facilities abroad for the particular field that I want to study.
15/01/24, 12:07 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad, that is great Walid!
15/01/24, 12:08 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Since you are aware that through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years?
15/01/24, 12:09 pm - +263 78 878 7885: Yes please do shed some light
15/01/24, 12:09 pm - Keshav Edoofa: You see Edoofa’s vision to provide every student with an education that is not just affordable but accessible and employable as well can only be achieved by utilizing the infrastructure of Indian Education landscape that has been developed over the last 75+ years since India’s Independence.

We shall meet at 1:00 PM CAT
15/01/24, 12:23 pm - +263 78 878 7885: Noted
15/01/24, 1:03 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Shall we continue with our session now?
15/01/24, 1:05 pm - +263 78 878 7885: Yes sir
15/01/24, 1:07 pm - Keshav Edoofa: So now Walid, I hope you must have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead. As of now would you like to ask anything so far?
15/01/24, 1:15 pm - +263 78 878 7885: Is Edoofa part of the Students till they graduate such that Edoofa will require school results from the students and also set certain standards for students to exceed so as to retain the scholarship?
15/01/24, 1:18 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I was coming to that Walid
15/01/24, 1:18 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :
1.     *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*​: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses,which is completely waived off.
 
2.     *Employability through practical training*​: We believe Students shouldn't just learn in theory, they should gain real-world experience instead of academic theory. That is why we help them by designing a practical employment oriented curriculum that helps students pick up job skills needed to be employable.
 
 
3.     *Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing and involving. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What’s more, students earn scholarship credits in the process, thereby further reducing the burden of the cost of their education.
 
 
4.     *Higher Education Concierge*​: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.

So, after looking over the facts that distinguish Edoofa, which of the four points did you appreciate the most?
15/01/24, 1:23 pm - +263 78 878 7885: 2 and 4
15/01/24, 1:24 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Great Walid!
15/01/24, 1:24 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I hope it cleared your doubt now with these points
15/01/24, 1:27 pm - +263 78 878 7885: Sure
15/01/24, 1:28 pm - Keshav Edoofa: So now moving ahead by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India?
15/01/24, 1:30 pm - +263 78 878 7885: I do not understand the question
15/01/24, 1:31 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Its okay Walid, I was asking that do you know cost of studying in India without any scholarship also cost of study in other abroad countries?
15/01/24, 1:32 pm - +263 78 878 7885: No sir
15/01/24, 1:33 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
15/01/24, 1:34 pm - Keshav Edoofa: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
15/01/24, 1:34 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*

15/01/24, 1:34 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
15/01/24, 1:38 pm - +263 78 878 7885: Understood
15/01/24, 1:42 pm - Keshav Edoofa: In simple words Walid, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
15/01/24, 1:44 pm - +263 78 878 7885: Alright sir
15/01/24, 1:44 pm - Keshav Edoofa: So now shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?
15/01/24, 1:45 pm - +263 78 878 7885: Sure
15/01/24, 1:45 pm - Keshav Edoofa: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
15/01/24, 1:45 pm - Keshav Edoofa: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

*1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-_*Africa Global Radio*_ - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

-_*Skooqs*_ - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
15/01/24, 1:45 pm - Keshav Edoofa: *2. Recruitment Partners: -*

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
15/01/24, 1:45 pm - Keshav Edoofa: *3. Webinars: -*

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
_Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world_ by *Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade*.

15/01/24, 1:45 pm - Keshav Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase. 

*What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
15/01/24, 1:55 pm - +263 78 878 7885: I would like to believe so
15/01/24, 1:56 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I am delighted to hear that Walid, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
15/01/24, 2:04 pm - +263 78 878 7885: So scholarship credits have a monetary value?
15/01/24, 2:06 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Walid scholarship credits that you earn have monetary value but these are something that you do not recieve as money rather they gets adjusted and reduce your semester fee here in indian university , the amount you earn here in EWYL will help you in reducing your fee
15/01/24, 2:08 pm - +263 78 878 7885: Noted
15/01/24, 2:08 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Alright then.
15/01/24, 2:09 pm - Keshav Edoofa: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

15/01/24, 2:09 pm - Keshav Edoofa: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
15/01/24, 2:25 pm - +263 78 878 7885: Noted
15/01/24, 2:26 pm - Keshav Edoofa: In our quest to provide an education that is affordable, accessible and employable, our Founders have been to African Nations multiple times. Recently during their stay in Zimbabwe in June 2023, they gained valuable insights. Inflation has been a real challenge for Zimbabwean families from the last 20 years.

Until a few years ago, cost of tertiary education in Zimbabwe was affordable for majority of families, however with the recent collapse of the Zimbabwean Dollar, a lot of parents shared their experiences, emphasized the financial challenges of pursuing higher education. In today’s time *Tertiary education expenses in Zimbabwe can amount to approximately $2500-$3500 annually. This surely varies from course to course.*

While the cost of education rose by 25% and is within the range of $1200-$1500 per year, the cost of living is notably high. *Even a basic meal of Sadza and curry can cost a student $1 per serving. This means around $1100 is allocated solely for food, with additional essential costs such as internet which costs around $25-$35 a month, accommodation, and transportation pushing the total to $2000-$2500 per year.
15/01/24, 2:34 pm - +263 78 878 7885: Im following
15/01/24, 2:39 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I hope you must have understood that Edoofa Scholarship Program is not a place where students get an opportunity to be just admitted in an Internationally Recognized University, rather it is much more than that. While there are multiple differentiators, Edoofa’s offered value to a particular student is more that what any admission agent/consultant may provide.


They even encountered Zimbabwean students who had applied for the Edoofa Program in 2018-2019 but hadn't proceeded due to the lure of quick earnings within the country. However, this year, those student shared their hardships, with some holding prestigious degrees from institutions like UZ, MSU, and HIT, now working as petrol attendants or mobile/laptop repair technicians. Others faced even greater challenges, resorting to selling Ecocash, Simcards, or vegetables.

Observing this scenario, it's evident that many of them regret not seizing the opportunity earlier. I as your counselor understand the harsh realities that are there in your home country. What are your thoughts regarding the same Walid?
15/01/24, 3:19 pm - +263 78 878 7885: It is true that many graduates are finding if difficult to find employment here in Zimbabwe and some even resort to seeking employment abroad. However some failures to secure employment etc are self caused . I have come across many vacancies and graduates failing to secure the jobs just because they could not express and tailor their Cv
15/01/24, 3:30 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Thats absolutely right Walid!
15/01/24, 3:31 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
15/01/24, 3:32 pm - +263 78 878 7885: Yes
15/01/24, 3:33 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Walid as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
15/01/24, 3:37 pm - +263 78 878 7885: $1500-$ 2 250
15/01/24, 3:38 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Exactly Walid!
15/01/24, 3:38 pm - Keshav Edoofa: And you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
15/01/24, 3:38 pm - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>
15/01/24, 3:38 pm - Keshav Edoofa: *But, as we know the COVID-19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
15/01/24, 3:42 pm - +263 78 878 7885: Noted
15/01/24, 3:42 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
15/01/24, 3:43 pm - +263 78 878 7885: Following
15/01/24, 3:44 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
15/01/24, 3:44 pm - +263 78 878 7885: Okay
15/01/24, 3:45 pm - Keshav Edoofa: You see Edoofa's exceptional program has opened up a world of opportunities for aspiring students, garnering thousands of applications on a daily basis. The Eligibility Evaluation process ensures that deserving candidates are granted the chance to participate in the program. *Once accepted, students are requested to pay a nominal Program Fee of $350 within 7 days of receiving their acceptance letter*, following which they commence with their admission process and the esteemed Earn While You Learn Program. Edoofa's mission to provide quality education and support to students is at the heart of this initiative, and we are honored to make a difference in the lives of deserving individuals through this program.
15/01/24, 3:45 pm - Keshav Edoofa: However Walid, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
15/01/24, 3:46 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Am I absolutely clear on this and did you comprehended this well?
15/01/24, 3:46 pm - +263 78 878 7885: Yes
15/01/24, 3:47 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Great Walid!
15/01/24, 3:48 pm - Keshav Edoofa: But I want to make sure your parents have received this information as well, @263775544486 @263772805963 are you following the payment policy?
15/01/24, 3:52 pm - +263 77 554 4486: This makes life easy indeed
15/01/24, 3:53 pm - +263 77 554 4486: Sure, quite understood.
15/01/24, 3:58 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Duly Noted Mr. Swadiki, If you or Mrs. Tupa need to ask me or something or want any clarification i am happy to help you!
15/01/24, 3:59 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.

Are you familiar with the Edoofa Cycle?
15/01/24, 4:00 pm - +263 78 878 7885: No
15/01/24, 4:03 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
15/01/24, 4:04 pm - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>
15/01/24, 4:04 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Alright Walid, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in COUNTRY itself. <This message was edited>

15/01/24, 4:10 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Okay Great!
15/01/24, 4:10 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of the registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
15/01/24, 4:11 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Basically, this registration fee will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August/September 2024 and the remaining in January next year 2025.
15/01/24, 4:11 pm - Keshav Edoofa: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
15/01/24, 4:12 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Here is a picture of the Visa of one of the Edoofian who arrived in India, for 2023 Academic Intake on 31st July 2023.

15/01/24, 4:29 pm - +263 78 878 7885: How long does the edoofa cycle take to complete
15/01/24, 4:31 pm - Keshav Edoofa: @263788787885 It totally depends upon a student's proactiveness, since I have seen students completing the entire cycle within 15 to 21 working days as well and I have also seen students taking 2 months to complete the entire process because of their network challenges!
15/01/24, 4:32 pm - +263 78 878 7885: And when will we proceed to step 2?
15/01/24, 4:33 pm - Keshav Edoofa: We would be proceeding ahead tomorrow @263788787885.
15/01/24, 4:33 pm - +263 78 878 7885: Also if having started, is an applicant forced to complete the Edoofa cycle?
15/01/24, 4:34 pm - Keshav Edoofa: @263788787885 without completing the Edoofa Cycle I hope you can understand the student cannot be a part of the Edoofa scholarship program. However from my experience I feel you might have meant to ask whether a student and their family is given appropriate time to prepare for the next stages so that they are not burdened throughout the journey, isn't it? <This message was edited>
15/01/24, 4:37 pm - +263 78 878 7885: Meaning to say if a student is not able to proceed with the application and the cycle, what happens then?
15/01/24, 4:40 pm - Keshav Edoofa: @263788787885 can you please help me have a better understanding as to why do you feel a student will not be able to proceed ahead please?
15/01/24, 4:43 pm - +263 78 878 7885: Maybe he fails to pay the fee, even in the 30 day period or he and the family just decide otherwise
15/01/24, 4:45 pm - Keshav Edoofa: @263788787885 please understand that you will not be asked to proceed ahead until and unless you as a family have discussed about this opportunity thoroughly amongst yourself. You will be given time for the same so that first you can share what all challenges are there which you wish to get addressed, and how you would like the team to help you out regarding the same!
15/01/24, 4:53 pm - +263 78 878 7885: Understood, Thank you
15/01/24, 4:55 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Okay so with this we come to the end of your child's counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check
15/01/24, 4:55 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*

Sure, you can go ahead but our network is slow today.
16/01/24, 10:49 am - +263 77 554 4486: Good morning Mr Keshav, your message is still hanging and cannot open.
We we'll be obliged if you kindly resend.
16/01/24, 10:58 am - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: How was your discussion with the family please?
16/01/24, 11:23 am - +263 77 554 4486: We discussed and we've understood what was shared by Mr Keshav.
You can go ahead with the next step.
16/01/24, 12:35 pm - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: Would you like to ask anything as of now please?
16/01/24, 12:47 pm - +263 78 878 7885: Does edoofa have any impacts in terms of religion as well?
16/01/24, 1:00 pm - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: @263788787885, this is quite a good question, as a lot of people have a misconception, about what kind of religious practices are followed in India.

You see, India is a secular country, wherein by the rule of law, every citizen is free to practice whatever they believe in, without interfering with the belief of another person.

Currently, you would be surprised to know there are 2.8 million people in India who follow Christianity, this number is twice the population of entire Zimbabwe.

Due to this, from last 5 years, our students have never had a challenge in following whatever they have always believed in, since most of the students who follow Christianity, visit church for their Sunday Prayers.
16/01/24, 1:03 pm - +263 78 878 7885: Understood sir
16/01/24, 1:06 pm - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: What else would you like to ask? <This message was edited>
16/01/24, 1:10 pm - +263 78 878 7885: I would like to confirm; there is a chance that after application a university might not accept a Student's application ?
16/01/24, 1:18 pm - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: @263788787885 a student who is eligible for the Edoofa Program has an assurity of admission so it is not possible that such a thing can happen.
16/01/24, 1:22 pm - +263 78 878 7885: Understood.
That'll be all.
16/01/24, 1:24 pm - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: Okay so in that case, I would like to ask you a few questions, but before that with immense pleasure, I would like to share the glimpses of the Africa Visit of our Founders which took place in June 2023! 

*It was a much-awaited event and they were welcomed by Ministries, Educationalists, Edoofians, and Parents across different African Countries. This is a must-watch video depicting the Acceptance of the Program in the African Continent, especially in Zimbabwe!!*
