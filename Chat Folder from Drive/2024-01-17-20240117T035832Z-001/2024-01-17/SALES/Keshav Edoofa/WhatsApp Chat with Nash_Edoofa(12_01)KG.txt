As discussed, I am here for us to continue with your application, so shall we start?

15/01/24, 10:49 am - Keshav Edoofa: Let me start today's session by briefing you about the Edoofa program in detail
15/01/24, 10:50 am - +263 78 473 9160: Okae fine....
15/01/24, 10:50 am - Keshav Edoofa: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
15/01/24, 10:50 am - Keshav Edoofa: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
15/01/24, 10:50 am - Keshav Edoofa: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
15/01/24, 10:50 am - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>
15/01/24, 10:50 am - Keshav Edoofa: *With immense pleasure,let me share glimpses of our Africa Visit of May- June 2023 where our Founders were welcomed by Educationists, Edoofians and parents from different African Nations, especially in Zimbabwe. You can go through our Global Education Summit hosted at Dominican Convent School, Harare on 28th May and at UCE, Bulawayo on the 2nd of June*
15/01/24, 10:53 am - +263 78 473 9160: Well ,I am motivated by the work of Edoofa
15/01/24, 10:54 am - +263 78 473 9160: It's really a good thing Mr Keshav
15/01/24, 10:54 am - Keshav Edoofa: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
15/01/24, 10:54 am - +263 78 473 9160: It's true,I really appreciate
15/01/24, 10:55 am - Keshav Edoofa: Great to know that Nash!
15/01/24, 10:56 am - Keshav Edoofa: Okay so Nash, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?

15/01/24, 2:41 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I am glad you are following Nash
15/01/24, 2:42 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
15/01/24, 2:42 pm - Keshav Edoofa: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
15/01/24, 2:42 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
15/01/24, 2:43 pm - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>
15/01/24, 2:43 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
15/01/24, 2:45 pm - +263 78 473 9160: Okaee thanks I have seen how Edoofa makes it easy for higher education abroad
15/01/24, 2:46 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Alright Nash noted
15/01/24, 2:46 pm - +263 78 473 9160: Well
15/01/24, 2:46 pm - Keshav Edoofa: In simple words Nash what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.
15/01/24, 2:47 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Now do you have anything to ask or shall I proceed further in explaining about the Earn While You Learn Program?
15/01/24, 2:48 pm - +263 78 473 9160: You do pay accomodation, food and clothes again
15/01/24, 2:49 pm - +263 78 473 9160: You reduce how??,through linkages with universities or
15/01/24, 2:49 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Annual fee of 2000-3000$ includes these all aspects
15/01/24, 2:49 pm - Keshav Edoofa: By providing scholarships Nash!
15/01/24, 2:50 pm - +263 78 473 9160: Okae
15/01/24, 2:50 pm - +263 78 473 9160: Alright,thank you sir ,I have understood
15/01/24, 2:50 pm - +263 78 473 9160: You may proceed
15/01/24, 2:51 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Good Nash , I believe you are good at grasping information
15/01/24, 2:52 pm - +263 78 473 9160: Yes , that's true
15/01/24, 2:53 pm - Keshav Edoofa: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
15/01/24, 2:53 pm - Keshav Edoofa: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

*1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

15/01/24, 2:53 pm - Keshav Edoofa: *2. Recruitment Partners: -*

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
15/01/24, 2:53 pm - Keshav Edoofa: *3. Webinars: -*

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
_Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world_ by *Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade*.

15/01/24, 2:53 pm - Keshav Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase. 

*What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
15/01/24, 2:54 pm - +263 78 473 9160: Let me download the photos
15/01/24, 2:54 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Sure Nash do kindly go through the messages carefully!
15/01/24, 2:59 pm - +263 78 473 9160: Yeah thanks I have ready all the messages and have seen the motivational quotes stated by different people on the pictures.Yeah ,they are really inspirational ..
15/01/24, 3:00 pm - +263 78 473 9160: It's really awesome!! Edoofa is a great company.I would love to be part of Edoofa (Edoofian)
15/01/24, 3:03 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I am delighted Nash, you have great enthusiasm!
15/01/24, 3:03 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
15/01/24, 3:13 pm - +263 78 473 9160: Noted Mr Keshav
15/01/24, 3:19 pm - +263 78 473 9160: My parents are requesting for your picture...
15/01/24, 3:32 pm - Keshav Edoofa: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

15/01/24, 3:36 pm - Keshav Edoofa: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
15/01/24, 3:37 pm - +263 78 473 9160: That's it sir ,I have been looking for this all along
15/01/24, 3:38 pm - +263 78 473 9160: So,after a student finishes his program ,what do you do with him ....
15/01/24, 3:54 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Sure Nash, let me help you with your concern here. Yes after completing your studies in India you will be employable globally. As you may know, each university offers courses with varying durations. In Zimbabwe, it is referred to as *industrial attachment* or *work internships*. India refers to it as *" placements."* Every university affiliated with the Edoofa Program has its own dedicated placement cell. Their primary mission is to ensure that all students secure placements in their pre-final year of education.
15/01/24, 3:55 pm - +263 78 473 9160: Okaee I have understood
15/01/24, 3:56 pm - Keshav Edoofa: We will throughout our program will train you with essential skills to get employed through our EWYL program and be alongside with you at every step of your journey guiding you.
15/01/24, 3:56 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I hope I addressed your concern!
15/01/24, 3:56 pm - +263 78 473 9160: Okae that's a good thing
15/01/24, 3:56 pm - +263 78 473 9160: You did well....
15/01/24, 3:57 pm - +263 78 473 9160: So,your work is only to help students to reach their dreams....
15/01/24, 4:00 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Yes Nash absolutely
15/01/24, 4:00 pm - +263 78 473 9160: Okaee thanks...
15/01/24, 4:02 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Over the past few days, the Edoofa team has been immersed in an exciting event we had in store for our students. Edoofa hosted a conference - the Symposium of Leaders, Innovators, and Creators at Edoofa, also known as 'SLICE-CON.'

The conference was attended by all the Edoofians of 2023 and a few senior Edoofians from previous batches. It focused on the art of creation, innovation, and, most importantly, the mindset required to make an impact in one's career.
15/01/24, 4:02 pm - Keshav Edoofa: During this Industrial Visit and the conference - SLICE CON, Corporate leaders, such as the CEOs and Co-founders from renowned companies like Rage Coffee, Sirona Hygiene, Jolin New York, and more, shared their insights and experiences. These individuals are at the helm of multi-millionaire brands, leading large marketing teams. Their presence added immense value, providing students with the opportunity to engage in transformative conversations.
15/01/24, 4:02 pm - Keshav Edoofa: We believe that interactions with such industry leaders can bring significant transformations to students' lives, enhancing their business acumen. Our Edoofians maximized this opportunity, having life-changing conversations with these influential figures. The main objective of the event was to emphasize the importance of thinking outside the box, and encouraging students to believe in themselves and their dreams. Before we discuss your admission journey further, I wanted to share a glimpse of the event, and I hope you are excited to attend similar events when you come to India.
15/01/24, 4:02 pm - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>
15/01/24, 4:03 pm - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>
15/01/24, 4:05 pm - +263 78 473 9160: Well , awesome!!,I will be very excited to attend such events
15/01/24, 4:07 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Exactly Nash , you will get to interact with industry leaders and get to experience networking, exposure and learning
15/01/24, 4:08 pm - +263 78 473 9160: Well , thank you
15/01/24, 4:09 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
15/01/24, 4:10 pm - +263 78 473 9160: Ready...
15/01/24, 4:12 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Nash as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
15/01/24, 4:13 pm - +263 78 473 9160: More than $1500
15/01/24, 4:14 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Exactly Nash!
15/01/24, 4:14 pm - Keshav Edoofa: you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
15/01/24, 4:14 pm - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>
15/01/24, 4:15 pm - Keshav Edoofa: *But, as we know the COVID-19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
15/01/24, 4:17 pm - +263 78 473 9160: Okaee noted ,so how may someone pay that fee
15/01/24, 4:24 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
15/01/24, 4:25 pm - +263 78 473 9160: Yes ,it's good
15/01/24, 4:26 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
15/01/24, 4:26 pm - Keshav Edoofa: You see Edoofa's exceptional program has opened up a world of opportunities for aspiring students, garnering thousands of applications on a daily basis. The Eligibility Evaluation process ensures that deserving candidates are granted the chance to participate in the program. *Once accepted, students are requested to pay a nominal Program Fee of $350 within 7 days of receiving their acceptance letter*, following which they commence with their admission process and the esteemed Earn While You Learn Program. Edoofa's mission to provide quality education and support to students is at the heart of this initiative, and we are honored to make a difference in the lives of deserving individuals through this program.
15/01/24, 4:27 pm - Keshav Edoofa: However Nash, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
15/01/24, 4:28 pm - +263 78 473 9160: Okaee fine noted ,am ready
15/01/24, 4:28 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.
15/01/24, 4:29 pm - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>
15/01/24, 4:29 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Nash as you can see, right now we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zimbabwe itself.
15/01/24, 4:29 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
15/01/24, 4:31 pm - +263 78 473 9160: Okaee noted ,we are still at step 1
15/01/24, 4:32 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Correct and you see, finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of the registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
15/01/24, 4:32 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Basically, this registration fee will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August/September 2024 and the remaining in January next year 2025.
15/01/24, 4:32 pm - Keshav Edoofa: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
15/01/24, 4:32 pm - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>
15/01/24, 4:33 pm - +263 78 473 9160: Okae I see
15/01/24, 4:33 pm - Keshav Edoofa: As of now @263784739160 would you like to ask anything else?
15/01/24, 4:34 pm - +263 78 473 9160: Huh I just want to know at which stage does an application fee maybe paid...
15/01/24, 4:35 pm - Keshav Edoofa: @263784739160 enrollment fee is paid at Stage 3 of the Edoofa Cycle!
15/01/24, 4:35 pm - +263 78 473 9160: Okae fine....
15/01/24, 4:35 pm - Keshav Edoofa: What else would you like to ask?
15/01/24, 4:35 pm - +263 78 473 9160: Huh am fine now
15/01/24, 4:37 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Okay so with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check
15/01/24, 4:37 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*

15/01/24, 4:37 pm - Keshav Edoofa: And for any questions apart from whatever we have explained, I would appreciate it if you refer your family to the FAQ document which has all the answers to most of the queries that generally parents have. 

Furthermore, if they have any other queries I would suggest that you note down all of the questions as I would like to inform you that *Tomorrow at 10am CAT* I will also be connecting with you and your family in this group itself, to assist you in planning your higher education and help them with the questions and queries that they might have. *I have also shared the Certificate of Incorporation of our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd. Do share the same with your parents so that if they would like to confirm anything they can get it confirmed please.*

16/01/24, 9:31 am - Keshav Edoofa: Good Morning Nash, Hope you are doing well.

I believe you must have discussed all the above mentioned points with your family?

I am here to address any questions if they have any.

Are we good to proceed with your application now?
16/01/24, 11:08 am - +263 78 473 9160: Good morning sir
16/01/24, 11:09 am - Keshav Edoofa: How are you doing @263784739160?
16/01/24, 11:10 am - +263 78 473 9160: Am doing well n u
16/01/24, 11:10 am - Keshav Edoofa: I am blessed please!
16/01/24, 11:10 am - Keshav Edoofa: How was your discussion with your family members regarding your application?
16/01/24, 11:11 am - +263 78 473 9160: Umm that one wax a big matter which was discussed yesterday
16/01/24, 11:11 am - +263 78 473 9160: They are saying that they can't afford it ....
16/01/24, 11:12 am - Keshav Edoofa: Can you elaborate Nash, what exactly did you happen to discuss with them and what all challenges did they happen to share with you?
16/01/24, 11:20 am - +263 78 473 9160: They are saying that they do not have the amount needed plus they are saying that is it automatic that if you pay the fee ,you gonna get the scholarship
16/01/24, 11:20 am - +263 78 473 9160: Plus they are fearing to be corrupted....
16/01/24, 12:21 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Nash I didn't get you can you please elaborate, what exactly were they referring and what exactly was their fear of being corrupted please?
16/01/24, 12:32 pm - +263 78 473 9160: Application fee which you said it's $350
16/01/24, 12:34 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Okay so @263784739160 your parents basically had a challenge with the program fee of $350, and apart from this what else did they happen to ask?
16/01/24, 12:35 pm - +263 78 473 9160: Nothing,that was the only issue , everything correct
16/01/24, 12:38 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Well Nash while I do understand what you are sharing, since your parents are concerned about the program fee of $350 and not any other finances, it seems that your parents would like to have a better clarity regarding the authenticity of the Edoofa Program, as right now they might be under the impression that anyone who pays the program fee gets the scholarship, isn't it?
17/01/24, 4:25 am - +263 78 473 9160: Good morning,sorry my data had depleted yesterday
17/01/24, 4:25 am - +263 78 473 9160: They now understand,we can continue
