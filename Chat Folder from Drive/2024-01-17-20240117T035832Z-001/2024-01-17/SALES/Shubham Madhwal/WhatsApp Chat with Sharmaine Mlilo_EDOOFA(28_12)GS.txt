You can address me as Mr Gurvinder, we do have Mr Shubham, Senior Academician and  Mr Jyotishman, Head of Admissions who will be evaluating your responses for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
28/12/23, 1:55 pm - +263 78 355 5813: Thank you very much sir

My mother is at work now so he won't be able to respond at the moment
28/12/23, 1:57 pm - Gurvinder: Noted.
28/12/23, 1:57 pm - Gurvinder: Alright, so Sharmaine, I can see you got to know about the Edoofa Program from Munyaradzi, is that correct?
28/12/23, 1:58 pm - +263 78 355 5813: Yes thats correct
28/12/23, 2:00 pm - Gurvinder: Okay, so can you tell me what all did you learn about the Edoofa Program from Munyaradzi, also do tell me whether you learnt about Munyaradzi’s Journey and Experience with the Edoofa Program?
28/12/23, 2:11 pm - +263 78 355 5813: I learnt that The Edoofa Scholarship Program can help make that dream a reality. That it's a program is designed to support young people from all backgrounds in accessing quality education, and it can open up a world of opportunities for you.
With this scholarship, you can access some of the best universities in India, gain new skills and knowledge, and build a bright future for yourself.
28/12/23, 2:15 pm - Gurvinder: That is correct, let me brief you more about the program.
28/12/23, 2:15 pm - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
28/12/23, 2:15 pm - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
28/12/23, 2:15 pm - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
28/12/23, 2:15 pm - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
28/12/23, 2:18 pm - +263 78 355 5813: Yes that is so Mr Gurvinder
28/12/23, 2:20 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so Sharmaine, as we start your counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
28/12/23, 2:22 pm - +263 78 355 5813: Yes l believe so
28/12/23, 2:27 pm - Gurvinder: Now Sharmaine, I would like to know you better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about yourself, your career aspiration do include sharing about:-

28/12/23, 4:19 pm - +263 78 868 2033: I loved electrical engineering because electrical engineers work in high-stake environments, they may face intense job pressure. They may also spend more hours at work meeting deadlines and completing their projects. Although electrical engineers may have excellent salary prospects, they often receive limited job growth. <This message was edited>
28/12/23, 4:28 pm - +263 78 868 2033: In accounting, helping people solve their problems and achieve their business goals is a pretty rewarding way to spend my time.

Personal development and aspiration, intellectual growth and personal interest in accounting 
I also enjoy working with financial reports in my daily work and the constant learning aspect that comes with working in accounting for example enjoying using mathematics and the skills that come along with a math-focused career. 
Accountants make up the backbone of every business and make a great career choice in terms of security and pay.

However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

Are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way inorder to transform your career dear?
29/12/23, 1:55 pm - +263 78 355 5813: Yes we are

29/12/23, 2:11 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
29/12/23, 2:12 pm - +263 78 868 2033: Moving to a different continent for school is a big decision especially for me, but it can be an incredible opportunity to experience a new culture and learn about the world. And a scholarship is a wonderful way to make this experience possible. For me, it can provide a unique cultural experience and the opportunity to learn about different cultures and ways of life. Studying abroad can also improve my language skills and give me a more global perspective. Additionally, it can expand my professional network and make me more competitive in the job market. India especially, is home to some of the best universities in the world, like the Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs). These schools offer high-quality education and are renowned for their research and innovation. And finally, India is a culturally rich country with a long history and diverse culture, which can be a valuable part of the educational experience.
29/12/23, 2:14 pm - Gurvinder: Please address this too.

I could also share my experience of living and studying in a different culture, which could help to promote intercultural understanding and communication skills. Additionally, l could act as a role model for other students, showing them that it's possible to pursue their dreams and make a difference in the world.
29/12/23, 2:19 pm - Gurvinder: I appreciate your sense of hardworking for your community Shantel, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?
29/12/23, 2:20 pm - +263 78 868 2033: Yes very well sir

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
29/12/23, 2:34 pm - +263 78 868 2033: Yes
29/12/23, 2:42 pm - Gurvinder: You see Edoofa’s vision to provide every student with an education that is not just affordable but accessible and employable as well can only be achieved by utilizing the infrastructure of Indian Education landscape that has been developed over the last 75+ years since India’s Independence.

*"The magic in new beginnings is truly the most powerful of them all."*

*Happy New Year to you and your family.*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
02/01/24, 8:00 pm - Gurvinder: Hi Dear, I hope you are doing well.

I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons that I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship. 

I hope to get a positive response from you soon.
03/01/24, 9:23 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

*“Don't let what you cannot do interfere with what you can do.”*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
03/01/24, 9:38 am - +263 78 355 5813: Good morning sir
03/01/24, 10:10 am - Gurvinder: May I know, why you have been so inactive?
03/01/24, 10:22 am - +263 78 355 5813: Sorry we were not able to get back to you.....we were in the rurals these past days and it's so hard to get network there
03/01/24, 11:54 am - Gurvinder: Noted.
03/01/24, 11:55 am - Gurvinder: So now Shermaine, I hope you must have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead. As of now would you like to ask anything so far?
03/01/24, 11:56 am - +263 78 868 2033: No sir
Everything was well understood
Thank you
03/01/24, 12:11 pm - +263 78 355 5813: Everything understood so far
03/01/24, 12:21 pm - Gurvinder: So now moving ahead by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India?
03/01/24, 12:29 pm - +263 78 355 5813: No we are not
03/01/24, 12:31 pm - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
03/01/24, 12:31 pm - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
03/01/24, 12:31 pm - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
03/01/24, 12:31 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
03/01/24, 12:32 pm - Gurvinder: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*

*after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
03/01/24, 12:34 pm - +263 78 355 5813: Well understood sir
03/01/24, 12:34 pm - Gurvinder: So now shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?
03/01/24, 12:37 pm - +263 78 868 2033: Yes please
03/01/24, 12:39 pm - Gurvinder: Shantel, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
03/01/24, 12:44 pm - +263 78 868 2033: Noted
03/01/24, 12:52 pm - Gurvinder: The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

*1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-_*Africa Global Radio*_ - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0

-_*Skooqs*_ - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
03/01/24, 12:52 pm - Gurvinder: *2. Recruitment Partners: -*

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
03/01/24, 12:52 pm - Gurvinder: *3. Webinars: -*

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
_Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world_ by *Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade*.
_How to network like a boss_ by *Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi*

03/01/24, 12:52 pm - Gurvinder: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase. 

*What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
03/01/24, 12:59 pm - +263 78 355 5813: Yes
03/01/24, 1:01 pm - Gurvinder: I am delighted to hear that Sharmaine, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
03/01/24, 1:02 pm - +263 78 355 5813: That's wonderful sir we understand very well
03/01/24, 1:03 pm - Gurvinder: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

03/01/24, 1:04 pm - Gurvinder: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
03/01/24, 1:05 pm - +263 78 355 5813: Yes it is sir
03/01/24, 1:12 pm - Gurvinder: Alright Sharmaine, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
03/01/24, 1:25 pm - +263 78 868 2033: Yes sir
03/01/24, 1:33 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so may I know if you have discussed international education plans with them in depth?
03/01/24, 2:43 pm - +263 78 868 2033: Yes we have
03/01/24, 2:50 pm - Gurvinder: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
03/01/24, 3:03 pm - +263 78 355 5813: Yes
03/01/24, 3:06 pm - Gurvinder: @263788682033 @263783555813 as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
03/01/24, 3:23 pm - +263 78 868 2033: About 1500-2250
03/01/24, 3:27 pm - Gurvinder: Exactly @263788682033 @263783555813 , and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
03/01/24, 3:27 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
03/01/24, 3:27 pm - +263 78 868 2033: Ok sir
03/01/24, 3:28 pm - Gurvinder: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
03/01/24, 3:29 pm - +263 78 868 2033: Wow
03/01/24, 3:29 pm - +263 78 868 2033: Indeed it does <This message was edited>
03/01/24, 3:29 pm - Gurvinder: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
03/01/24, 3:30 pm - Gurvinder: You see Edoofa's exceptional program has opened up a world of opportunities for aspiring students, garnering thousands of applications on a daily basis. The Eligibility Evaluation process ensures that deserving candidates are granted the chance to participate in the program. *Once accepted, students are requested to pay a nominal Program Fee of $350 within 7 days of receiving their acceptance letter*, following which they commence with their admission process and the esteemed Earn While You Learn Program. Edoofa's mission to provide quality education and support to students is at the heart of this initiative, and we are honored to make a difference in the lives of deserving individuals through this program.
03/01/24, 3:30 pm - Gurvinder: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
03/01/24, 3:32 pm - +263 78 868 2033: Well understood
03/01/24, 3:33 pm - Gurvinder: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.

Are you familiar with the Edoofa Cycle?
03/01/24, 3:33 pm - +263 78 355 5813: Have heard of it
03/01/24, 3:34 pm - +263 78 868 2033: We'll like to go through it again
03/01/24, 3:34 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
03/01/24, 3:35 pm - Gurvinder: Alright @263788682033 @263783555813 , so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zimbabwe itself.
03/01/24, 3:35 pm - Gurvinder: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
03/01/24, 3:37 pm - +263 78 868 2033: Yes
03/01/24, 3:37 pm - Gurvinder: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of the registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
03/01/24, 3:37 pm - Gurvinder: Basically, this registration fee will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August/September 2024 and the remaining in January next year 2025.
03/01/24, 3:37 pm - Gurvinder: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
03/01/24, 3:37 pm - Gurvinder: So now would you like to ask anything?
03/01/24, 3:39 pm - +263 78 868 2033: Not yet
03/01/24, 3:39 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check
03/01/24, 3:39 pm - Gurvinder: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
03/01/24, 3:39 pm - Gurvinder: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

SECTION 2 READING TEST

Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage.
If a person suddenly encounters any terrible danger, the change of nature one undergoes is equally great. Sometimes fear numbs our senses. Like animals, one stands still, powerless to move a step in fright or to lift a hand in defense of our lives, and sometimes one is seized with panic, and again, act more like the inferior animals than rational beings. On the other hand, frequently in cases of sudden extreme peril, which cannot be escaped by flight, and must be instantly faced, even the most timid men at once as if by miracle, become possessed of the necessary courage, sharp quick apprehension and swift decision. This is a miracle very common in nature. Man and the inferior animals alike, when confronted with almost certain death ‘ gather resolution from despair’ but there can really be no trace of so debilitating a feeling in the person fighting, or prepare
d to fight for dear life. At such times the mind is clearer than it has ever been; the nerves are steel, there is nothing felt but a wonderful strength and daring. Looking back at certain perilous moments in my own life, I remember them with a kind of joy, not that there was any joyful excitement then, but because they broadened my horizon, lifted me for a time above myself.

"My Inspirational Story"

It is more than just words

A Mercedes Benz is a powerful and impressive car but it is powerless until someone sits on it and turns on the engine. It is when the engine is in action that it's power can be felt and marvelled at. Words do not mean a thing until someone shows action towards what they mean or say. People can make promises they have no intentions of keeping but until behavior concides with it the other person will probably never believe you.Stokes once said if your actions cannot live up to your words then you have got nothing to say. We have to act upon our words not say things that we are not going to do at the end that is what l learnt in my life

SECTION 2 READING TEST

Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage.
If a person suddenly encounters any terrible danger, the change of nature one undergoes is equally great. Sometimes fear numbs our senses. Like animals, one stands still, powerless to move a step in fright or to lift a hand in defense of our lives, and sometimes one is seized with panic, and again, act more like the inferior animals than rational beings. On the other hand, frequently in cases of sudden extreme peril, which cannot be escaped by flight, and must be instantly faced, even the most timid men at once as if by miracle, become possessed of the necessary courage, sharp quick apprehension and swift decision. This is a miracle very common in nature. Man and the inferior animals alike, when confronted with almost certain death ‘ gather resolution from despair’ but there can really be no trace of so debilitating a feeling in the person fighting, or prepare
d to fight for dear life. At such times the mind is clearer than it has ever been; the nerves are steel, there is nothing felt but a wonderful strength and daring. Looking back at certain perilous moments in my own life, I remember them with a kind of joy, not that there was any joyful excitement then, but because they broadened my horizon, lifted me for a time above myself.

Whey to Go Greek yogurt—a strained form of cultured yogurt—has grown enormously in popularity in the United States since it was first introduced in the country in the late 1980s. From 2011 to 2012 alone, sales of Greek yogurt in the US increased by 50 percent. The resulting increase in Greek yogurt production has forced those involved in the business to address the detrimental effects that the yogurt-making process may be having on the environment. Fortunately, farmers and others in the Greek yogurt business have found many methods of controlling and eliminating most environmental threats. Given these solutions as well as the many health benefits of the food, the advantages of Greek yogurt Q5. outdo the potential drawbacks of its production.Sentence [1] The main environmental problem caused by the production of Greek yogurt is the creation of acid whey as a by-product.Sentence [2] Because it requires up to four times more milk to make than conventional yogurt does, Greek yogurt produces larger amounts of acid whey, which is difficult to dispose of.Sentence [3] To address the problem of disposal, farmers have found a number of uses for acid whey. Sentence[4] They can add it to, feed as a protein Q.6. supplement and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt. Sentence[5] If it is improperly introduced into the environment, acid-whey runoff Q.7. can pollute waterways, depleting the oxygen content of streams and rivers as it decomposes.

It's been 16 years since the horrific Rwandan genocide, and while the country has made significant progress in rebuilding itself, the scars of the tragedy are still very much visible. Life for Rwandans has changed drastically in the years since the genocide. The economy has grown, infrastructure has been rebuilt, and the country has made progress in improving its education and healthcare systems. However, many Rwandans still live in poverty, and the effects of the genocide are still felt in the form of trauma and mistrust among different ethnic groups.
The Rwandan genocide was one of the worst tragedies of the 20th century, and its aftermath is still being felt by the country's people. The economy has made significant progress in the years since, with GDP per capita more than doubling since 2000. However, poverty is still a significant issue, with around 40% of the population living below the poverty line. In terms of infrastructure, the country has rebuilt much of what was destroyed during the genocide, including roads, schools, and hospitals. Education and healthcare have also seen significant improvements, with primary school enrollment increasing from 62% in 2000 to over 90% today.

11/01/24, 2:17 pm - +263 78 868 2033: My inspirational story 

I was  born into a poor family in Bulawayo, Zimbabwe. My parents struggled to make ends meet, and l often went without the basic necessities of life. Life was a constant struggle, and there were few moments of joy. I often felt lonely and isolated, like no one understood the difficulties l faced.From an early age, l had to take on a lot of responsibility. I helped my mother with household chores while she was at work. I never had much time to be a child, and l often felt like l was carrying the weight of the world on my shoulders. I didn't have many friends, and l rarely got to do the things that other children enjoyed. I felt as though life was passing me by, and l longed for a different life.

My future depended on my education. I threw myself into my studies, determined to make something of myself. I worked hard at school and one day l felt like l was on my way to a better life when I got the opportunity to apply for the Edoofa scholarship .It was a scholarship to study electrical engineering in India. This was my chance to not only pursue my dream, but also change the story of my life and my community
