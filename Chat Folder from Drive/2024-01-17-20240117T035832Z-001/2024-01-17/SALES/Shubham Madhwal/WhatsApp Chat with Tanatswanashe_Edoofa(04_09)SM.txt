I also look forward to being a pioneer , ground breaking and successful female engneer whose ideas and creations are recognized world wide .
Courtesy of EDOOFA funding education will provide an opportunity for me  to  improve safety in Aeronautical engineering discipline , enhance my welfare and that of my family ,as well as ploough back to the community at large .

09/09/23, 10:22 am - +263 77 267 4398: Mr Sagar, morning. howau?
09/09/23, 10:22 am - Gurvinder: I am doing fine, thank you!
09/09/23, 10:22 am - Gurvinder: May I know how are you?
09/09/23, 10:28 am - +263 77 267 4398: I'm well, thanks for asking, and thank you for the information on India's  education system and the milestones achieved. Wonderful. Makes good reading, and buttresses Tanatswa's decision to choose the EDOOFA program
09/09/23, 10:29 am - Gurvinder: You're very welcome! I'm glad to hear that you found the information about India's education system and the EDOOFA program appealing. It's great to know that Tanatswa's decision aligns well with the program's offerings and the educational opportunities available in India.
09/09/23, 10:38 am - +263 77 267 4398: Indeed. FYI, i work in finance in the pharmaceutical industry and am quite exposed to India's prowess in the science field. Most local medicines & pharmaceutical products are imported from Indian, either directly or through local agents . Also, locals are flying to India for medical surgeries & treatment due to affordability & advancement
09/09/23, 10:39 am - Gurvinder: That's fascinating to hear! India has indeed made significant strides in the pharmaceutical and healthcare sectors, earning recognition for its quality medicines, affordable healthcare services, and medical advancements. It's wonderful to see how India's contributions in these fields are positively impacting not only its citizens but also people around the world, including those in Zimbabwe
09/09/23, 10:44 am - +263 77 267 4398: True. I can atest to that. It is my wish that through these program such as Edoofa my country benefits immensely & our healthcare system improves vastly. It is my belief that sometimes lives are lost unnecessarily due to poor healthcare and technological systems. Once we improve our education system lifespans can also increase
09/09/23, 10:50 am - Gurvinder: You bring up an essential point, and it's clear that education plays a pivotal role in the overall development of a country, including its healthcare system.
09/09/23, 10:50 am - Gurvinder: Okay, so are you or any of your family members aware of the expense of a comparable quality higher education for an international student without a scholarship in India?
09/09/23, 11:14 am - +263 77 832 4244: No Sir
09/09/23, 11:28 am - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the cost of a Bachelor's degree from a university *ranges from 6000-8000 USD. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from USD 15000 to USD 35000. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000*.
09/09/23, 11:28 am - Gurvinder: Now as we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with over 250+ Universities for the last 13 + years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 5 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
09/09/23, 11:28 am - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
09/09/23, 11:29 am - Gurvinder: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:


*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
09/09/23, 11:32 am - +263 77 832 4244: Thank you Sir
09/09/23, 11:34 am - +263 77 832 4244: Sir are there an specific requirements for the earn while you learn program
09/09/23, 11:37 am - Gurvinder: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost nearly $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food, and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

*Shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?*
09/09/23, 11:41 am - +263 77 832 4244: Yes Sir
09/09/23, 12:53 pm - Gurvinder: The Earn While You Learn Program or the *EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program*. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
09/09/23, 12:53 pm - Gurvinder: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
09/09/23, 1:39 pm - Gurvinder: As it's the weekend, Now we will connect on Monday at 09:00 AM. Please be online during your session time!

In the meantime please go through the links I am sharing for a better understanding of the program

11/09/23, 8:03 pm - +263 77 267 4398: Its fine, Mr Sagar. Good night to you, too.
12/09/23, 11:28 am - +263 77 267 4398: Morning to you, Mr Sagar. Thanks for the inspiring word
12/09/23, 11:33 am - Gurvinder: I will explain the Payment Policy to you as we proceed ahead!
12/09/23, 11:33 am - Gurvinder: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education.

Don’t you think so?
12/09/23, 11:33 am - Gurvinder: Greetings @263772674398
12/09/23, 11:35 am - +263 77 267 4398: Thank you, trust you are well. I am following your conversation with Tanatswa.
12/09/23, 11:35 am - Gurvinder: That is great to know.
12/09/23, 11:35 am - Gurvinder: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
12/09/23, 11:36 am - Gurvinder: Tanatswanashe basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
12/09/23, 11:36 am - Gurvinder: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*

I am Mr Shubham, Senior Academician at Edoofa

I have been evaluating your responses in the counselling session with your counsellor.

I believe you must have gone through the entire counselling session once again with your family members.

*Are we good to proceed with your eligibility check evaluation now?*
13/09/23, 9:55 am - +263 77 267 4398: Greetings Mr Shubham.
Yes, kindly proceed.
Mr Utonga
13/09/23, 10:18 am - Shubham Madhwal: Please I hope you have been following the session so far.
13/09/23, 10:18 am - Shubham Madhwal: So are there any questions that you or your family would like to ask regarding the program details?
13/09/23, 10:21 am - +263 77 267 4398: Yes, i have been eagerly following the sessions & am in the picture
13/09/23, 10:21 am - +263 77 832 4244: Good morning Sir
13/09/23, 10:39 am - Shubham Madhwal: Glad to hear that please!
13/09/23, 10:40 am - Shubham Madhwal: Mr Utonga,
I'm sure you would be very much happy to be a part of your child's career counselling sessions. As we are interacting for the very first time, can you tell me a bit more about yourself, your highest education, your profession and what motivates you to support your child to study abroad?
13/09/23, 11:07 am - +263 77 267 4398: Thank you... well about myself,i am a father of 3, Tanatswa being the eldest. I am in my mid 40s, currently employed as an assistant accountant at a state enterprise. I have 20years  experience in accounting and credit managerment, was once a debtors supervisor.I hold an honours degree in accounting, and several qualifications in accounting and credit managament from local universities/institutions. I am passionate about upskilling and reskilling myself, as well as my children, to align myself with modern trends, to remain relevant. Education helps create employment opportunities, develop peoblem solving skills, help one secure higher income (which benefits themselves & their dependants) and also helps improve an economy. It is my wish to see my Tanatswa & my other children get the best opportunities to further their education and expose them to the best environments conducive to achieving their dreams
13/09/23, 12:23 pm - Shubham Madhwal: It is indeed a pleasure to be connected with you, *Mr Utonga*, so I hope you know that the Edoofa Program makes higher education affordable through financial aid and how it helps the students make a financial plan to ensure their dream of higher education abroad is fulfilled.

I believe that is exactly what you are looking forward to from the program for *Tanatswanasshe*, right?
13/09/23, 12:31 pm - +263 77 267 4398: Correct
13/09/23, 1:10 pm - Shubham Madhwal: I hope you are aware of the cost of education after the scholarship and also about the 7-day enrollment fee payment deadline.
13/09/23, 1:25 pm - +263 77 267 4398: I am aware of the 7-day enrolment fee. Not sure about the cost of education after scholarship. I may have missed something
13/09/23, 2:26 pm - Shubham Madhwal: So Mr and Mrs Utonga @263772674398 @263772675707 , before we move to the Eligibility Procedures, can you tell me

1. What is the name of the course that Tanatswanashe would be studying through the Edoofa Program?

2. In which country will you be studying through the Edoofa program?

3. What is the average cost of studies in India without a scholarship?

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.

25/09/23, 9:12 am - Shubham Madhwal: Good Morning Tanatswanashe, Mr and Mrs Utonga @263778324244 @263772674398 @263772675707, How are you?
25/09/23, 9:40 am - +263 77 267 4398: Good morning @918527919212 ! How are you this morning
25/09/23, 9:52 am - Shubham Madhwal: I am doing great please
25/09/23, 9:52 am - Shubham Madhwal: So are you available for the session?
25/09/23, 10:05 am - +263 77 267 4398: Yes
25/09/23, 10:07 am - Shubham Madhwal: So I hope you have gone through Tanatswanashe's acceptance letter?
25/09/23, 10:09 am - +263 77 267 4398: Yes, i have.
25/09/23, 10:42 am - Shubham Madhwal: So are there any questions you would like to ask regarding the acceptance letter?
25/09/23, 11:16 am - +263 77 267 4398: No, Sir. Everything is clear, and i understand it.
25/09/23, 11:17 am - Shubham Madhwal: So what is the enrollment fees payment deadline mentioned in your letter?
25/09/23, 11:31 am - +263 77 267 4398: 29 Sept 2023... 2 options are availed
1) usd350 as a once off payment
2) usd200 payable by 29 sept, with balance (usd150) payable on 29 oct '23
25/09/23, 11:32 am - +263 77 267 4398: I  choose option 2
25/09/23, 11:51 am - Shubham Madhwal: Alright so, if you have gone through your Letter of Acceptance thoroughly, you must have seen, there are two modes of fee payments mentioned:-

1. Direct Bank Transfer to our Parent Company's account
2. Deposit in our associate's account over there in Zimbabwe

May I know which mode according to you would be convenient, so that I can brief you in-depth about that particular mode?
25/09/23, 11:52 am - +263 77 267 4398: Option 1... Option 2 has additional charges, a 11% levy.
25/09/23, 11:54 am - Shubham Madhwal: You see in the first mode, the Direct Bank Transfer Mode, the transfer charges which are to be borne by the parents of the student ranges between $80 to $100 which becomes quite high for a lot of parents considering the economic situation in Zimbabwe itself. So as not every student is in a position to cater for an additional $80 to $100 just as a transfer charge, the second mode was introduced, wherein, it is the Bank deposit in Mr Shorwi's Account.

So as you can see in the letter that there is a Bank deposit in, Mr Shorwi Ex-Principal of Hartzell High School's account as he is our Associated Partner there in Zimbabwe,
25/09/23, 12:02 pm - +263 77 267 4398: Thank you for clarifying that to me. It was an oversight on my part. Based on your explanation it makes economic sense to use Option 2... i presume i should then share a POP to you notifying of the payment made through Mr Shorwi. And, a receipt will be issued in due course
25/09/23, 12:03 pm - Shubham Madhwal: The fee payment can also be made through Hartzell High. School Ex-Principal himself. Since his account is a NOSTRO Account which only holds USD itself, *therefore the necessary amount including the transfer charges in this mode itself would be 11% of the fees you are paying* the same details are as below:-

BANK NAME: FBC

BRANCH: Mutare

ACC NAME: Kawadza Shorwi

ACC NUMBER: 5333038009240398

CONTACT NUMBER: +263 77 364 0738
