I am Mr Gurvinder Singh, Senior Career Counselor at Edoofa

Welcome to the Edoofa Scholarship Counselling Session
19/12/23, 11:41 am - +260 97 1142911: Thank you
19/12/23, 11:41 am - +260 97 1142911: Am ready
19/12/23, 12:18 pm - Gurvinder: So should I brief you about the program?
19/12/23, 12:18 pm - +260 97 1142911: Yes sure
19/12/23, 12:51 pm - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
19/12/23, 12:51 pm - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
19/12/23, 12:51 pm - Gurvinder: EDOOFA has commended the new government for its dedicated efforts and positive changes in the education sector, including the elimination of school fees, an increase in the number of teachers, and a focus on protecting vulnerable learners, particularly adolescent girls. *Edoofa is proud to support the government in its mission to transform the education sector and achieve sustainable development, aimed at ensuring quality education that is inclusive and equitable for all by 2030.*
19/12/23, 12:52 pm - Gurvinder: With the influx of students from Zimbabwe, we recorded more than 1500 students to the program in each of the last two years. Having a strong network and grasp of more than 100 schools with a panel of Headmasters, teachers, parents, and other educators, we now look to replicate our success in Zambia as well where we have already begun enrolling students since the last 6 months and we have closed 2023 intake with over 1500 students.
19/12/23, 12:52 pm - Gurvinder: *Our strong relationships with educational institutions, such as Penmal Connect Ltd. and Trident College in Zambia, have led to numerous successful outcomes and partnerships with schools including Kamulanga High, Canisius Secondary, Sanjongo Secondary, The Copperbelt University, Chavuma Boarding Secondary, Mutanda Boarding Secondary, Chimwemwe Secondary, National Hillcrest, Matero Boys Secondary, and others. We are also connected with institutions like Njase, Ndola Girls, Fatima Secondary, Torbit, and Zambezi Boarding among others, to provide, expand and build upon the opportunities of the Edoofa Scholarship Program for deserving students throughout Zambia*
19/12/23, 12:52 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
19/12/23, 12:52 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
19/12/23, 12:52 pm - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
19/12/23, 1:08 pm - +260 97 1142911: Yes thank you I have read through and I would be proud to be an edoofian am definitely looking forward to it
19/12/23, 1:20 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so Mrs.Mercy, as we start your daughter's counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
19/12/23, 1:23 pm - +260 97 1142911: Yes please...
19/12/23, 1:55 pm - Gurvinder: Now Mrs Mercy, I would like to know Beenzu better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about her, her career aspiration do include sharing about:-

1. Her highest education level?
2. The course she would like to study?

4. What is the parent’s highest education level?
5. Who has been supporting her for her Education so far?
6. Who will be supporting her financially for her higher education abroad?
7. Does she have any siblings? if yes, what do they do?


Please elaborate on your answers and answer them in points, so that I can understand your application more briefly and assist you in a better way

21/12/23, 9:49 am - +260 97 1142911: Good morning thanks 🙏
21/12/23, 11:55 am - Gurvinder: Mrs Mercy, if you would have researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their Grade 12 which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*.

You see majority of the time students study subjects as per their country's requirements, therefore, the only courses left that these students could pursue ahead which would also align with the healthcare sector are 

1. Bachelor of Science in Nutrition and Dietetics

2. Bachelor of Science in Microbiology

3. Bachelor of Science in Medical Laboratory Technology

4. Bachelor of Science in Cardiovascular Technology

5. Bachelor of science in Physiotherapy

6. Bachelor of science in Optometry

7. Bachelor of science in Biochemistry

8. Bachelor of Science in Biotechnology
21/12/23, 12:14 pm - +260 97 1142911: Noted... Am confident enough that Beenzu's final grade 12 results will be very good in terms of the mentioned three subjects. She had really improved in terms of performance..... she can take the course Bachelor of science in nutrition and Dietetics... your advice please 🙏
21/12/23, 12:20 pm - Gurvinder: Yes Mrs Mercy, I would be happy to offer her *Bachelor of Science in Nutrition and Dietetics*.
21/12/23, 12:23 pm - +260 97 1142911: It would be our pleasure.
21/12/23, 12:29 pm - Gurvinder: As per the eligibility criteria,  In order to help the students get a quality education and a good quantum of  scholarship, Students should clear the following aspects:

1. I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria, in order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 4 Grade 12 passes.

2. Students should manage to clear our in-house scholarship test and interview process with an overall aggregate of 80% and above.

In case a student has a grade greater than or equal to 6 Grade Description: Satisfactory, then we do consider special recommendations by the School Heads taking into consideration other Extra-Curricular or Sports activities.
21/12/23, 12:40 pm - +260 97 1142911: Well noted
21/12/23, 12:40 pm - Gurvinder: So shall I brief you about the course?
21/12/23, 12:43 pm - +260 97 1142911: Sure
21/12/23, 1:42 pm - Gurvinder: *B.Sc. in Nutrition and Dietetics* is a 3- year long full- time undergraduate course divided over 6 semesters. It involves the study of food management, promotion of health through healthy food, and primarily focusses on the relationship between the body and food.
B.Sc. in Nutrition and Dietetics essentially involves an advanced learning in ways to enhance the quality of life and overall well-being by promoting healthy diet behaviors and exploring healthier dietary modifications.
21/12/23, 1:42 pm - Gurvinder: The program consists of a comprehensive curriculum that combines the science of nutrition with a broader view of wellness, community and environment, delving into reasons for unhealthy eating behaviors and ways to rectify and improve the same.
21/12/23, 1:42 pm - Gurvinder: Students interested in learning about nutritional matters and food habits, and in training in health care units such as clinics, hospitals and community nutrition in close proximity of doctors, clinicians and dieticians, are best suited for a B.Sc. in Nutrition & Dietetics.
21/12/23, 1:42 pm - Gurvinder: Ideal candidates would have relevant skills such as tact, team spirit and compassion, and an inherent instinct to counsel, guide, and treat patients suffering from diet- based health issues.
21/12/23, 1:42 pm - Gurvinder: Nutrition and Dietetics is fast- growing both as an academic discipline and in practical application, both in India and abroad. Successful graduates of the course interested in further studies in the discipline may pursue M.Sc., M.Phil. and Ph. D in the same subject. Those interested in professionally working in the industry and find lucrative employment opportunities in private sector clinics and hospitals, or may get self-employed.
21/12/23, 1:42 pm - Gurvinder: Other areas of employment include private sector organizations such as leisure cruise companies and private nursing homes. Such graduates may also choose to become psychiatric nursing as a profession where they work with patients suffering from emotional and psychological distress caused from unhealthy diet patterns.
21/12/23, 1:51 pm - +260 97 1142911: Okay so interesting she would really love it
21/12/23, 2:33 pm - Gurvinder: That is great.
21/12/23, 2:33 pm - Gurvinder: However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which she has chosen, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

Is she willing to give her 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come her way inorder to transform her career?
21/12/23, 3:10 pm - +260 97 1142911: Yes she is ready to put in her best.
21/12/23, 3:27 pm - Gurvinder: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why she wants to study abroad and not in your country?
21/12/23, 4:03 pm - +260 97 1142911: The reason is that studying abroad offers diverse benefits such as exposure to different cultures, access to world class education, language, emersion and the chance to build a global network. additionally, it provides an opportunity for personal growth, independence and a broader perspective which can enhance career prospects in an increasingly interconnected world.
22/12/23, 8:48 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

23/12/23, 11:43 am - +260 97 1142911: Good morning thanks 🙏
23/12/23, 11:59 am - Gurvinder: Okay so basically, you are aiming for her to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to make her study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue her higher education through this scholarship, how is she planning to contribute her learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
23/12/23, 12:26 pm - +260 97 1142911: Well, contribution would be through collaborating with  local educational institutions and  authorities. She would share her knowledge through workshops, seminars, or even by developing and implementing nutrition-related programs and also advocating for the integration of nutrition education into existing programs. This would  have a positive impact on the overall health and well-being of the country.
23/12/23, 1:06 pm - Gurvinder: I appreciate your sense of hardworking for your community Mrs Mercy, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?
23/12/23, 1:22 pm - +260 97 1142911: I do agree...hence the quest for such an education from abroad to even be more of a reputed personality...
26/12/23, 8:46 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

26/12/23, 9:07 am - Gurvinder: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
26/12/23, 2:09 pm - +260 97 1142911: Yes
26/12/23, 2:13 pm - Gurvinder: You see Edoofa’s vision to provide every student with an education that is not just affordable but accessible and employable as well can only be achieved by utilizing the infrastructure of Indian Education landscape that has been developed over the last 75+ years since India’s Independence.
26/12/23, 2:13 pm - Gurvinder: *Following are the reasons as to Why Edoofa Focuses on India for Scholarships: A Quick Look!*

26/12/23, 2:21 pm - +260 97 1142911: Great!
26/12/23, 2:41 pm - Gurvinder: So now Mrs Mercy, I hope you must have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead. As of now would you like to ask anything so far?
26/12/23, 3:05 pm - Gurvinder: Are we still connected?
26/12/23, 3:06 pm - +260 97 1142911: Are there are any obligations or expectations for scholarship recipients after completing the courses?
26/12/23, 3:21 pm - Gurvinder: No, there are no obligations after completing the courses.
26/12/23, 3:21 pm - Gurvinder: So now moving ahead by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India?
26/12/23, 3:23 pm - +260 97 1142911: None of us is familiar.
26/12/23, 3:23 pm - +260 97 1142911: Alright.. thanks
26/12/23, 3:24 pm - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
26/12/23, 3:24 pm - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
26/12/23, 3:24 pm - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
26/12/23, 3:24 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
26/12/23, 3:25 pm - Gurvinder: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*

*after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
26/12/23, 3:32 pm - +260 97 1142911: Well noted.
26/12/23, 3:34 pm - Gurvinder: So now shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?
26/12/23, 3:35 pm - +260 97 1142911: Sure
26/12/23, 3:38 pm - Gurvinder: Mrs Mercy, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
26/12/23, 3:43 pm - +260 97 1142911: Wow... it's a good one
26/12/23, 3:44 pm - Gurvinder: The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

*1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-_*Africa Global Radio*_ - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

26/12/23, 3:44 pm - Gurvinder: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase. 

*What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
26/12/23, 3:46 pm - +260 97 1142911: Very much beneficial.
26/12/23, 3:54 pm - Gurvinder: I am delighted to hear that Mrs Mercy, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_ <This message was edited>
26/12/23, 3:56 pm - +260 97 1142911: Noted
26/12/23, 4:01 pm - Gurvinder: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

26/12/23, 4:01 pm - Gurvinder: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
26/12/23, 4:04 pm - +260 97 1142911: It is
26/12/23, 4:06 pm - Gurvinder: Alright Mrs Mercy, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe you and your family members would be the ones who would be supporting Beenzu for her higher education.
26/12/23, 4:14 pm - +260 97 1142911: I don't get it when you say we would be the ones supporting Beenzu for her higher education.... which areas needs financial support from family? And where does  scholarship come in? Maybe we missed it somewhere.
26/12/23, 4:16 pm - Gurvinder: Didn't I tell you that we bring down the cost of Education from $6000-$8000 to $2000-$3000?
26/12/23, 4:29 pm - +260 97 1142911: Oh....ok. you did... thought you pay for the whole education.
26/12/23, 4:38 pm - Gurvinder: Noted.
26/12/23, 4:38 pm - Gurvinder: So please address this.
26/12/23, 4:55 pm - +260 97 1142911: Alright
26/12/23, 4:56 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so may I know if you have discussed international education plans with them in depth?
26/12/23, 4:57 pm - +260 97 1142911: Who? The family?
26/12/23, 4:58 pm - Gurvinder: Yes.
26/12/23, 5:01 pm - +260 97 1142911: Yes...we discussed
26/12/23, 5:02 pm - Gurvinder: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
26/12/23, 5:03 pm - +260 97 1142911: Yes please
26/12/23, 5:06 pm - Gurvinder: Mrs Mercy as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
26/12/23, 5:07 pm - +260 97 1142911: Noted
26/12/23, 5:08 pm - Gurvinder: Please answer the exact figure?
26/12/23, 5:11 pm - +260 97 1142911: Applying in 1 university
26/12/23, 5:12 pm - Gurvinder: Please, for applying in 5?
26/12/23, 5:13 pm - +260 97 1142911: Kindly make me understand
26/12/23, 5:14 pm - Gurvinder: If applying to one University costs around $300-$450, what will it cost to apply in 5?
26/12/23, 5:15 pm - +260 97 1142911: Am I supposed to multiply the figures you have given me by 5 or what?
26/12/23, 5:16 pm - Gurvinder: Yes, please.
26/12/23, 5:17 pm - +260 97 1142911: Oh ok...it will be between $1500-$2250
26/12/23, 5:18 pm - Gurvinder: Exactly Mrs Mercy, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
26/12/23, 5:18 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
26/12/23, 5:19 pm - +260 97 1142911: Ok
26/12/23, 5:19 pm - Gurvinder: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
26/12/23, 5:21 pm - +260 97 1142911: I do so
26/12/23, 5:22 pm - Gurvinder: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
26/12/23, 5:22 pm - +260 97 1142911: Ok
26/12/23, 5:22 pm - Gurvinder: Basically, there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee, before their Grade 12 result is out).


Phase 3: Once the final grade 12 results are out, if the student would have passed the necessary requirement (of 4 Grade 12 passes.) then start with their University Interaction. If the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents.


The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.

However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
26/12/23, 5:24 pm - Gurvinder: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.

Are you familiar with the Edoofa Cycle?
26/12/23, 5:24 pm - +260 97 1142911: No.
26/12/23, 5:26 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
26/12/23, 5:26 pm - Gurvinder: Alright Mrs Mercy, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zambia itself.
26/12/23, 5:26 pm - Gurvinder: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
26/12/23, 5:29 pm - +260 97 1142911: Av understood
26/12/23, 5:29 pm - Gurvinder: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of the registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
26/12/23, 5:29 pm - Gurvinder: Basically, this registration fee will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August/September 2024 and the remaining in January next year 2025.
26/12/23, 5:29 pm - Gurvinder: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
26/12/23, 5:29 pm - Gurvinder: So now would you like to ask anything?
26/12/23, 5:34 pm - +260 97 1142911: Ok... what is the duration of the course?
26/12/23, 5:35 pm - Gurvinder: Please, I told you, it is a 3-year course.
26/12/23, 5:37 pm - +260 97 1142911: Ok
26/12/23, 5:37 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check
26/12/23, 5:38 pm - Gurvinder: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
26/12/23, 5:38 pm - Gurvinder: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

Parent participation is mandatory in this session, failure to attend would result in the cancellation of the application.
26/12/23, 5:41 pm - +260 97 1142911: Alright thanks
27/12/23, 9:22 am - Gurvinder: Hello @260971142911 @260977408074 .

I believe you must have gone through the entire counselling session once again with your family members.

Are we good to proceed with your eligibility check evaluation now?
27/12/23, 9:26 am - +260 97 1142911: Yes please
27/12/23, 9:43 am - Gurvinder: Please I hope you have been following the session so far.

So are there any questions that you or your family would like to ask regarding the program details?
27/12/23, 9:43 am - +260 97 1142911: No....I think everything is well explained.
27/12/23, 9:49 am - Gurvinder: I hope you are aware of the cost of education after the scholarship and also about the 7-day enrollment fee payment deadline.
27/12/23, 9:50 am - +260 97 1142911: Yes please
27/12/23, 9:51 am - Gurvinder: So @260971142911, before we move to the Eligibility Procedures, can you tell me

1. What is the name of the course that Beenzu would be studying through the Edoofa Program?

2. In which country will your child be studying through the Edoofa program?

3. What is the average cost of studies in India without a scholarship?

4. What is the annual fee you will pay if found eligible for the program?

5. What is the enrollment fee of the Edoofa Program and in how many days is it paid if you are found eligible?

6. Please elaborate on your understanding of the Earn While You Learn program in 75-100 words.

7. After receiving your offer letter from the University, you will have to pay your registration fee in order to finalise your university selection and reserve your scholarship seat in a particular university, this registration fee will be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?
27/12/23, 10:28 am - +260 97 1142911: 1. *Bachelor of Science in Nutrition and Dietetics*.
2. India
3. $6000-$8000
4. $2000-$3000
5. $350
6.The Earn While You Learn Program is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
7. Yes
27/12/23, 10:38 am - Gurvinder: Please answer the 5th question properly.
27/12/23, 10:54 am - +260 97 1142911: $350 to be paid within 7 days from the receipt of the acceptance letter.
27/12/23, 11:40 am - Gurvinder: *@260971142911*,  I am happy to see that you understand the program details so well. I totally understand that you have work to do and So I really appreciate your cooperation and the time you are taking out to support your child.
27/12/23, 11:40 am - Gurvinder: Please note that the number of scholarship seats is limited in number, and in case *Beenzu* is selected for the scholarship we expect that you are clear and aware of all the details shared during the session along with that you also obey the rules and honour the scholarship terms.
27/12/23, 11:40 am - Gurvinder: In case you do not follow these terms then *Beenzu’s* entire scholarship process will go into backlog and you will only be able to apply for the scholarship after 6 months. By then the entire fee structure for the scholarship program may increase*.
27/12/23, 11:59 am - +260 97 1142911: Ok... thank you...so when will be the selection done?
27/12/23, 12:03 pm - Gurvinder: Please, let me continue, the final result will be out after the Interview.
27/12/23, 12:04 pm - Gurvinder: Ideally, as you know, the tentative dates are:
1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the *2nd or 3rd of January 2024* for $200 and the *2nd or 3rd of February 2024* for the remaining $150.
2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the *2nd or 3rd of January 2024*
27/12/23, 12:04 pm - Gurvinder: Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?
27/12/23, 12:23 pm - +260 97 1142911: I would opt for the first one...but currently we're not yet financially prepared... January 3 is just next week and we've not yet gathered resources together...
27/12/23, 12:24 pm - Gurvinder: May I know, what is the issue?
27/12/23, 12:32 pm - +260 97 1142911: The issue is, we were looking at this Edoofa scholarship as being full time sponsorship because we just learnt of it this very moment Beenzu was completing her grade 12, and in terms of preparing money, we had not ....so will have to run up and down looking for money to support her.. otherwise we really need our child to get an education from India.
27/12/23, 12:46 pm - Gurvinder: May I know, when will you be financially prepared for the same?
27/12/23, 1:36 pm - +260 97 1142911: June/July
27/12/23, 1:42 pm - Gurvinder: Mrs Mercy, right now you only have to worry about the enrollment fees, this will help Beenzu to start the EWYL program in January itself, assuming she could make $100 per month, this could result in you having $600-$700 in scholarship credits already when she has to join the University, thus less financial burden on you parents.
27/12/23, 3:07 pm - +260 97 1142911: Oh yeah... That's very true... I wish the time frame of payment of the same enrollment fee wasn't that short... otherwise we will always look around.
27/12/23, 3:10 pm - Gurvinder: May I know, when can you manage your finances for the Enrollment fee.
27/12/23, 3:12 pm - +260 97 1142911: June/July this is the time we will have something as family.
27/12/23, 3:16 pm - Gurvinder: This message was deleted
27/12/23, 3:17 pm - Gurvinder: *I personally feel there is actually something that is concerning you because of which you are not Proceeding ahead with the process, And I am still willing to assist you with a solution if you wish to continue ahead and get your child enrolled in the Edoofa Program*
27/12/23, 3:19 pm - +260 97 1142911: Ok thanks for everything..but in an event where we happen to find finances soonest, can you be contacted?
27/12/23, 3:21 pm - +260 97 1142911: We really wish our child to continue ahead and get enrolled and you can assist with a solution
27/12/23, 3:39 pm - Gurvinder: The Academic Board has rules about deadlines that they can't change. But after thinking about your situation, they're willing to help. They're offering a way for you to pay a part of the fee, which is $100. This $100 is really important because it's what you need to pay within the next 7 days to make sure your child can join the program.

Once you pay this first $100, it secures your child's spot. After that, you'll have some more time until January 10th to pay the second $100 and then after 30 days of that you have to pay the remaining $150.

Paying this first $100 in the next 7 days is super important to make sure your child can be a part of the program.

SECTION 2 READING TEST

Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage.
If a person suddenly encounters any terrible danger, the change of nature one undergoes is equally great. Sometimes fear numbs our senses. Like animals, one stands still, powerless to move a step in fright or to lift a hand in defense of our lives, and sometimes one is seized with panic, and again, act more like the inferior animals than rational beings. On the other hand, frequently in cases of sudden extreme peril, which cannot be escaped by flight, and must be instantly faced, even the most timid men at once as if by miracle, become possessed of the necessary courage, sharp quick apprehension and swift decision. This is a miracle very common in nature. Man and the inferior animals alike, when confronted with almost certain death ‘ gather resolution from despair’ but there can really be no trace of so debilitating a feeling in the person fighting, or prepare
d to fight for dear life. At such times the mind is clearer than it has ever been; the nerves are steel, there is nothing felt but a wonderful strength and daring. Looking back at certain perilous moments in my own life, I remember them with a kind of joy, not that there was any joyful excitement then, but because they broadened my horizon, lifted me for a time above myself.

Whey to Go Greek yogurt—a strained form of cultured yogurt—has grown enormously in popularity in the United States since it was first introduced in the country in the late 1980s. From 2011 to 2012 alone, sales of Greek yogurt in the US increased by 50 percent. The resulting increase in Greek yogurt production has forced those involved in the business to address the detrimental effects that the yogurt-making process may be having on the environment. Fortunately, farmers and others in the Greek yogurt business have found many methods of controlling and eliminating most environmental threats. Given these solutions as well as the many health benefits of the food, the advantages of Greek yogurt Q5. outdo the potential drawbacks of its production.Sentence [1] The main environmental problem caused by the production of Greek yogurt is the creation of acid whey as a by-product.Sentence [2] Because it requires up to four times more milk to make than conventional yogurt does, Greek yogurt produces larger amounts of acid whey, which is difficult to dispose of.Sentence [3] To address the problem of disposal, farmers have found a number of uses for acid whey. Sentence[4] They can add it to livestock feed as a protein Q.6. supplement and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt. Sentence[5] If it is improperly introduced into the environment, acid-whey runoff Q.7. can pollute waterways, depleting the oxygen content of streams and rivers as it decomposes.

Life in Rwanda, 16 years after the genocide, reflects a complex narrative of resilience, reconciliation, and reconstruction. The aftermath of the 1994 genocide left an indelible mark on the nation, its people, and the global conscience. The subsequent years have witnessed remarkable transformations, challenging perceptions of the country and inspiring hope for a better future.

Rwanda's journey from the depths of despair to its present state is a testament to the strength of its people and visionary leadership. The genocide, which claimed nearly a million lives in just 100 days, shattered the social fabric of the nation. Families were torn apart, communities devastated, and trust obliterated. However, the post-genocide era has been defined by a collective commitment to healing and rebuilding.

One of the most striking aspects of life in Rwanda today is the emphasis on unity and reconciliation. The government, under the leadership of President Paul Kagame, has implemented policies that prioritize national unity over ethnic divisions. The divisive ethnic identities of Hutu, Tutsi, and Twa have been downplayed in favor of a more inclusive Rwandan identity. This deliberate effort to foster unity has played a crucial role in rebuilding trust among the population.

The Gacaca courts, a community-based justice system, were established to address the overwhelming number of genocide-related cases. This innovative approach sought not only to bring perpetrators to justice but also to promote truth-telling and reconciliation. While the Gacaca courts faced challenges and criticisms, they represented a unique attempt to navigate the complexities of justice and reconciliation in the aftermath of such a traumatic event.

Economically, Rwanda has experienced significant growth and development. The government has implemented policies to attract foreign investment, promote entrepreneurship, and diversify the economy. The capital, Kigali, has transformed into a hub of innovation and technology, earning the nickname "the Singapore of Africa." Infrastructure development, including the construction of roads and the expansion of the Kigali International Airport, has further facilitated economic progress.

Education has been a focal point for the government, recognizing the role it plays in shaping the future of the nation. Efforts to improve access to education and promote inclusivity have resulted in increased enrollment and literacy rates. The emphasis on education also extends to the remembrance and understanding of the genocide, ensuring that younger generations are aware of their history.

Despite these positive changes, challenges persist. The psychological scars of the genocide run deep, and the process of reconciliation is ongoing. Many survivors and perpetrators continue to grapple with the trauma, and the need for mental health support remains a critical aspect of the healing process. Additionally, issues of justice, accountability, and the reintegration of former combatants into society pose ongoing challenges.

In conclusion, life in Rwanda 16 years after the genocide reflects a nation's determined effort to rise from the ashes of tragedy. The emphasis on unity, reconciliation, and economic development has paved the way for a more hopeful future. However, the journey is far from over, and Rwanda continues to navigate the complexities of post-genocide recovery. The story of Rwanda serves as a reminder of the human capacity for resilience and transformation, offering lessons for the global community on the possibilities of healing and rebuilding even in the face of unimaginable adversity.

SECTION 6

Journey of Zambia's President

In the heart of Southern Africa, a nation emerged from the shadows of adversity, guided by the visionary leadership of Zambia's President. His journey from a grassroots activist to the highest office in the land is an inspirational narrative that has revitalized the spirit of the Zambian people.

Born into humble beginnings, the president's early life mirrored the challenges faced by many in his nation. However, his insatiable thirst for knowledge became the compass guiding him through the maze of hardships. With a scholarship in hand, he pursued higher education, recognizing that education was not just a personal pursuit but a key to unlocking the potential of an entire nation.

As a young activist, he stood on the frontlines, advocating for social justice and economic empowerment. His unwavering commitment to the welfare of the people earned him the trust of communities grappling with poverty and inequality. It was this grassroots connection that would later define his presidency.

Assuming office during a period of economic uncertainty, the president faced a daunting task. Undeterred, he embarked on a mission to transform Zambia into a beacon of progress and inclusivity. His economic policies aimed at fostering growth while ensuring that the benefits reached even the remotest corners of the country.

One of the president's hallmark achievements was a comprehensive healthcare reform, recognizing that a healthy nation is a productive nation. Under his leadership, healthcare infrastructure saw unprecedented development, and initiatives were launched to address endemic diseases. The president's commitment to the well-being of every Zambian became a rallying cry for a healthier and more resilient nation.

In the realm of education, the president championed initiatives to increase access and improve the quality of learning. Recognizing that education is the cornerstone of progress, he implemented policies that encouraged innovation, technology adoption, and global collaboration. Schools became hubs of inspiration, nurturing the next generation of leaders and visionaries.

Yet, perhaps the most transformative aspect of the president's tenure was his dedication to fostering unity and inclusivity. He recognized the strength in diversity and tirelessly worked to bridge gaps, ensuring that every citizen, regardless of background, had a stake in Zambia's journey toward prosperity.

As the nation navigated global challenges, the president stood tall, a symbol of resilience and forward-thinking leadership. His ability to steer Zambia through turbulent waters, coupled with a commitment to ethical governance, earned him not just respect within the nation but admiration on the international stage.

The story of Zambia's president is a testament to the belief that transformative leadership is born from a deep understanding of the people's needs and an unwavering commitment to a shared vision. His journey inspires not just Zambians but serves as a beacon of hope for nations seeking progress, unity, and a brighter future under the guidance of visionary leadership.

This story inspires me greatly and makes me to believe that where there's a will, they'll always be a way.

16/01/24, 1:25 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Please I can see that you have missed your enrollment fee payment deadline for Beenzu, Do you wish to continue with the process or?
16/01/24, 2:53 pm - +260 97 1142911: Would really have loved to continue...but it's like we've become financially handicapped as family....the time frame for sourcing funds is just too short to enable us run around... otherwise we've really tried to look around but luck is not on our side...I wish it was at a time when we were getting our salaries.
16/01/24, 2:56 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Can yoou elaborate on the issues you are facing?
16/01/24, 3:13 pm - +260 97 1142911: The thing is.... what was on our mind when we learnt about edoofa was that...it's a full-time scholarship program. That's how we encouraged Beenzu to go ahead and try her luck....we also thought it wouldn't be so soon to arrange for any costs attached in case of anything...no wonder in one of the interview sessions, I mentioned that we would have money around June July... but because from your understood explanations, we thought maybe we can find money somewhere to enable Beenzu be enrolled but unfortunately we have failed to raise the $100 you said can secure her place in a week's time. We're really grateful for the opportunity you are giving her.... it's just that the time this is coming has found us with financial struggles.
