12/01/24, 9:21 am - +263 77 637 1431: I am sorry for late response owing to network challenge.l was offline due to network challenge.l look forward to hearing from you Sir
12/01/24, 9:34 am - Shubham Madhwal: Good Morning Everyone, 

*"The greatest glory in living lies not in never falling, but in rising every time we fall."*

*When you step into this day realize that you have immense opportunities! All you need to do is give your best to grab it.*

With all positive energy, I am here to continue our interactive session.
12/01/24, 10:28 am - +263 77 637 1431: Morning Sir
12/01/24, 10:45 am - Shubham Madhwal: Welcome to the session, It is good to see that you have taken the time to learn about the program and fill out the application form. Can you please tell me:
*1)  What motivated you to apply for the Edoofa Scholarship program?*
*2) What is your understanding of the program as per your discussions with Thrive?*
12/01/24, 10:51 am - +263 77 637 1431: This message was deleted
12/01/24, 10:52 am - +263 77 637 1431: Its two fold on the sense that l will be upgrading my education and also getting employment
12/01/24, 11:00 am - +263 77 637 1431: I was inspired to apply for Edoofa by the fact that l will be benefitting two things, education and partly employment.It gives an opportunity to put my education knowledge into practice.I therefore find Edoofa as a form of empowerment
12/01/24, 11:06 am - +263 77 637 1431: I have an overmastering desire to take my educational level to another standard which will in turn be beneficial to the global village through application of it,l find Edoofa as the only entity that can help me to achieve my goals amidst the 5cs l read.
The program is two fold in the sense that l am getting financial aid on the basis of academic merit, simultaneously l will be on employment. Indian education is more affordable compared to Zimbabwe ,hence my interest for Edoofa which offers me employment opportunities.
12/01/24, 11:15 am - +263 77 637 1431: I also prefer Edoofa because the cost of education at our local universities is an uphill climb.University of Zimbabwe and other universities are charging 850Usd per semester.After graduating employment opportunities are as scarce as hen's teeth.Edoofa offers an opportunity to be employed in India while furthering my studies
12/01/24, 11:56 am - Shubham Madhwal: Duly Noted, 
I can see that you have a partial understanding of the Edoofa Program, during the course of the session ahead, I will help you and your parents to understand the program and the process to get enrolled for the scholarship in detail
12/01/24, 11:56 am - Shubham Madhwal: *Your application has been shortlisted for this prestigious opportunity and we expect you to go through all the information, and be transparent and active throughout the counselling session and Evaluation*

So are we good to begin your session?
12/01/24, 11:57 am - +263 77 637 1431: Yes
12/01/24, 1:03 pm - Shubham Madhwal: So let me further elaborate to you on the Edoofa Scholarship Program
Edoofa Scholarship Program is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4500 students from different countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability is driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!
12/01/24, 1:03 pm - Shubham Madhwal: You know we have been helping students from the African nations and the SAARC countries for the past 6 years and in the short span of 6 years, the most common feedback which we hear from the students is how the Edoofa Program makes the higher education affordable through the financial aid and how it helps the students to make a financial plan to make sure that their dream of higher education abroad is fulfilled.

Basically, our motive is that by providing the SEELS (Students of Edoofa Earning and Learning to Success) initiative, we help our students in Planning and Giving them opportunities through which they can help themselves by self-sponsoring their higher education at the least annual Fee Possible.

I was waiting for you to share your concerns with me but unfortunately, I didn’t hear from you and therefore I was asked to put your application on hold, but before doing the same, I was going through the form you submitted, I noticed that you come from family background wherein you plan to pursue your higher education abroad and was looking for a scholarship.
