12/01/24, 3:56 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Thank you for sharing this, Let me brief you that, I want to brief you that the criteria before the pandemic was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is *a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.
12/01/24, 3:57 pm - Pallika Edoofa: And, As your evaluation progresses, I appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country. In this process did you do any prior research on foreign education or applied to any University abroad?
12/01/24, 4:28 pm - +263 78 196 7983: No l haven't done any research yet or applied to any university abroad as l was waiting for the results
12/01/24, 4:40 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
13/01/24, 10:28 am - Pallika Edoofa: Greetings,

*"If you can dream it, you can do it."*

On this positive note, are we good to begin today's session?
13/01/24, 10:43 am - +263 78 196 7983: Good morning
Yes we can begin

13/01/24, 11:17 am - Pallika Edoofa: I would like to know if you are interested in Medical field so, why haven't you pursue physics in A level?
13/01/24, 12:01 pm - +263 78 196 7983: I could have but someone told me that for medicine you have to do biology
13/01/24, 12:02 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Let me tell you that the requirements vary depending on the country Since Medical Education and Engineering are two aspects for which the Indian Education System is known, both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level: Physics, Chemistry, and Biology. If they want to study any Engineering Course, they should have Physics and Mathematics at their A level mandatorily.
13/01/24, 12:03 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Since you do not have Physics, I regret to inform you that you are not eligible for Medicine and Pharmacy, but considering your interest there are better courses from the Medical Field itself that you are eligible for and which can help fulfill your dreams of working in this field
 
*Bachelor of Science in Medical Lab Technology*

*Physiotherapy*

*Bachelor of Science in Biotechnology*

*Bachelor of Science in Biomedical Sciences*

*Bachelor of Science in Cardiovascular Technology*
