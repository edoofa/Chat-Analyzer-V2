*So, I am making you the group admin. I see one of your parents is already a part of the group. Please add other parent/guardians or educational supporters and let me know the names and the relations once done. Let me know if there is any challenge.*

13/01/24, 11:15 am - Pallika Edoofa: Great!
13/01/24, 11:15 am - Pallika Edoofa: I would like to know if you are interested in Medical field so, why haven't you pursue physics in A level?
13/01/24, 11:17 am - +263 71 450 0173: I preferred biology instead. Although I got an A in O level for physics but we didn't have a specialized teacher so it was tough.
13/01/24, 11:22 am - Pallika Edoofa: Let me tell you that the requirements vary depending on the country Since Medical Education and Engineering are two aspects for which the Indian Education System is known, both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level: Physics, Chemistry, and Biology. If they want to study any Engineering Course, they should have Physics and Mathematics at their A level mandatorily.
13/01/24, 11:24 am - +263 71 450 0173: So what can I do?
13/01/24, 11:28 am - +263 71 450 0173: What about biomedical engineering
13/01/24, 1:33 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Since you do not have Physics, I regret to inform you that you are not eligible for Medicine and Pharmacy, but considering your interest there are better courses from the Medical Field itself that you are eligible for and which can help fulfill your dreams of working in this field
 
*Bachelor of Science in Medical Lab Technology*

*Physiotherapy*

*Bachelor of Science in Biotechnology*

*Bachelor of Science in Biomedical Sciences*

*Bachelor of Science in Cardiovascular Technology*

*Bachelor of Science in Microbiology*, etc

Would you like me to explain any of these programs for you?
