12/01/24, 4:17 pm - +263 78 982 1563: Because I was still getting used to the pressure plus the teachers didn't give us so much attention becoz of the outgoing upper sixes
12/01/24, 4:17 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I understand that, Unathi!
12/01/24, 4:18 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Let me brief you that, I want to brief you that the criteria before the pandemic was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is *a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.
12/01/24, 4:18 pm - Pallika Edoofa: And, As your evaluation progresses, I appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country. In this process did you do any prior research on foreign education or applied to any University abroad?
12/01/24, 4:19 pm - +263 78 982 1563: not yet.... I was still looking for scholarships and I'm trying by all means to achieve high standards
12/01/24, 4:24 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
12/01/24, 4:31 pm - +263 78 982 1563: okay thanks

15/01/24, 4:21 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Unathi, Let me tell you that we do not offer Actuarial science as a course, while Actuarial Science is indeed an independent and specialized degree program, there are certain aspects to consider that make a Bachelor of Commerce (BCom) a favorable alternative for students
While Actuarial Science is a field with a unique focus on risk management and financial security, the comprehensive nature of a BCom degree can offer a strong foundation for a successful and diverse career in various other sectors including risk management and financial security.
15/01/24, 4:23 pm - +263 78 982 1563: okay I understand

15/01/24, 4:25 pm - +263 78 982 1563: yess
15/01/24, 4:27 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright!
15/01/24, 4:28 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Bachelor of Commerce (B.com)* is a three year long undergraduate course that is evenly distributed into 6 half-yearly semesters.

15/01/24, 5:12 pm - +263 78 982 1563: Studying in India could have a positive impact on my career in several ways. First, the diverse curriculum and different perspectives offered by Indian universities could help me gain a broader understanding of the world. Second, studying in India would give me the opportunity to build connections with people from different backgrounds and cultures. And third, it could help me stand out from other candidates in the job market, as it would demonstrate my willingness to explore new experiences and challenges.
15/01/24, 5:14 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Absolutely! You've highlighted some fantastic points. Studying in India can indeed offer a diverse and enriching experience, providing a broader perspective, fostering valuable connections, and enhancing your marketability in the professional world. It's an exciting prospect!
15/01/24, 5:14 pm - Pallika Edoofa: As I can see, you have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead.

*By any chance are you familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship?*
15/01/24, 5:53 pm - +263 78 982 1563: thanks 😊
15/01/24, 5:54 pm - +263 78 982 1563: noo
15/01/24, 6:34 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Kindly excuse for the delay, as I was having my dinner.
15/01/24, 6:34 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That’s alright, Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India compared to other global hubs.

In India, international students face an average expense of *$6000-$8000 annually.* While this is very low as compared to the Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc where the cost of education ranges from $15000-$35000 annually, it is still beyond the reach of many.

With the Edoofa Scholarship Program, the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000 per annum* for the students who are found eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility Check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Laundry, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*

15/01/24, 6:34 pm - Pallika Edoofa: In simple words what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost $3000 or less a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well. 

However, as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even after this we allow the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.

*So do you feel the reduced cost of education is affordable to your family?*
