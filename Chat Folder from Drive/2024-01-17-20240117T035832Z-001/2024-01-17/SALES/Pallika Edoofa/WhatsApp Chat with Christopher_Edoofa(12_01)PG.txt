1. Now I'm currently doing form six doing Mathematics, Biology and Chemistry. I will be finishing Alevel this year November.
2. My dream is to become a neurosurgeon. I will be starting with the Medicine program and then another degree. It will be tuff but I believe I will make it.
3. My real parents died. The one who's my breadwinner is my fathers younger brother who is an engineer in Uk. He did motormake.
4. I have brothers and sisters. All of my brothers and sisters are married. They all do part time jobs because they don't have qualifications to apply for better jobs. I'm the one, to pass my olevel and to do Alevel. I believe in myself that I will change my family's life and I don't want the next generation to experience what I experience.
7. My dad who is in Uk  will be supporting me.
8. I'm from Mashonaland East.
9.  I went to Zimre Secondary up to form 3 and I began to do home schooling because my dad told I should start do Cambridge syllabus. I was no longer doing Zimsec. Now I'm also doing homeschooling for my Alevel. My fee for Olevel per month was 120 Us and for Alevel is 195 Us per month

16/01/24, 9:11 am - Pallika Edoofa: Greetings Everyone, 
How are you all doing today?

Shall we begin our session?
16/01/24, 6:20 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Hi Christopher, I hope you are in good health.

I was hoping to connect with you and take your application forward to check your eligibility for the Edoofa Scholarship Program as we have discussed your application, but since you didn’t respond, I am afraid I will have to put your application on hold temporarily. However please Note by Wednesday, I would have to submit my final response regarding your application, so failure to get back to me would mean cancellation of your application after which you would have to re-apply  

Feel free to connect with me again, when you think you are ready to proceed further. Below is a video explaining the details of the Edoofa Program
