You can also add anything more that you would like to share.
10/01/24, 2:06 pm - +263 77 114 2891: Ok my son Hamlet is a quiet guy he likes going to church.Spent most of his time reading.His wish is to study abroad he always says that.He passed his O level with 11 subjects A's and B's.At the moment he is doing his A level at Thekwane high school.His carrer aspirations he wants to be a doctor.He likes foot ball.He is the only son in the family others are girls.Thekwane is his school from form 1 to A level and he is now the deputy head boy at school.School fees we are paying $605 and $60 for science levie.The father is the one who is paying fees.
10/01/24, 2:40 pm - Kunal: It's wonderful to learn more about, Hamlet. His academic achievements with 11 subjects at O-level, his dedication to studies, and his position as the deputy head boy at Thekwane High School showcase his commitment to both education and leadership. His dream of studying abroad to become a doctor is ambitious and admirable, especially given his impressive academic performance.
10/01/24, 2:41 pm - Kunal: I hope you are aware that studying abroad involves a financial aspect. May I know who will support him financially with his education abroad?
10/01/24, 2:56 pm - +263 77 114 2891: Yes iam aware.The reason why he sent his application to you is he needs some financial help coz we as parents we can not afford.Fees we are struggling  the reason we want this boy to get somewhere in life.
10/01/24, 3:23 pm - Kunal: I can understand
As you know, Edoofa Scholarship Program offers 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. The remaining cost after scholarship and cost of Living and Transportation is catered by a student's family

If found eligible, are you in a position to raise them?
10/01/24, 3:32 pm - +263 77 114 2891: Ok i think good to know the range of fees that way we can have an idea if we can afford.
10/01/24, 3:33 pm - +263 77 114 2891: its good to know rang of fees
10/01/24, 3:34 pm - +263 77 114 2891: Can i ask.What about the air tickets and visa's .
10/01/24, 3:46 pm - Kunal: If you understand the concept of International Education, the finances that play a major role is not visa fee or flight ticket because visa fee is given once in the whole program and the flight ticket is taken a limited number of times,maybe twice or once,because international students don't often travel back to their country.

They look forward to settling down and making sure education is not hampered.So they learn and do internships at breaks.But still students can definitely visit their family during holidays and spend time with them.

But I personally have seen that students don't travel often,so considering these the traveling fee
*(air fare :-around $400,Visa fee:-$83) is to be borne by the student* which is mostly a one time investment.
10/01/24, 4:49 pm - +263 77 114 2891: Ok i undertand
10/01/24, 4:50 pm - +263 77 114 2891: understand
10/01/24, 4:52 pm - +263 77 114 2891: Now what i want to know is how much fees just give me an idea since we are interested.

11/01/24, 2:17 pm - Kunal: Noted
Let me brief you that, I want to brief you that the criteria before the pandemic was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is *a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about Hamlet achieving it. <This message was edited>
11/01/24, 2:29 pm - +263 77 114 2891: Ok noted i as a parent iam expecting good results.By his grace he can make it.
11/01/24, 2:32 pm - +263 77 114 2891: And i think 2 passes its fair
11/01/24, 2:36 pm - Kunal: May I know with with dream to be a doctor, why didn't he opt for Physics at A level?
11/01/24, 2:42 pm - +263 77 114 2891: Umm that much i dont know.
11/01/24, 2:46 pm - Kunal: I do understand , Since Medical Education and Engineering are two aspects for which the Indian Education System is known, both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. There fore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are Physics, Chemistry, and Biology. whereas if they want to study any Engineering Course then they should have Physics, Chemistry and Mathematics in their A level mandatorily.
11/01/24, 2:47 pm - Kunal: Since he is not having Physics, I regret to inform you that he is not eligible for Medicine, but considering his interest there are better courses from the Medical Field itself that he is eligible for and which can help fulfill his dreams of working in this field

This enables the degree holder to go for higher degree programs in respective subjects for a master’s degree and then further studies
11/01/24, 3:05 pm - Kunal: *B.Sc. in Microbiology* is a 3- year long, full- time course divided into 6 semesters, with each semester lasting for a period of 6 months. Microbiology has emerged as a key biological science since microorganisms provide the model used in molecular biology for research purposes.

Such research at the molecular level has provided and continues to provide answers to numerous fundamental questions in Genetics, Metabolism, Cell forms & functions. There is a growing recognition of the potential of microorganisms in a range of applied areas.

The ability of microorganisms to degrade oil in oil spills, herbicides, pesticides, and to supplement food, produce energy, besides other uses of microorganisms is becoming increasingly relevant and useful. Microbiologists study these organisms using tools, like microscopes, genetics, and culturing.

Microscopes allow scientists to magnify microbial cells that are otherwise too small to see. Genetics and Molecular Biology help scientists understand the evolutionary relationships between microbes and their habitats. Culturing is the term used to describe growing microbes, usually combined with tests to see what the microbes like to eat or what conditions they can live in. A petri dish is a common place where microbes are cultivated.

Infections from pathogenic bacteria can sometimes clear up on their own, or with help from antibiotics. Antibiotics are the various medicines that fight bacteria by damaging proteins, the cell wall, or carrying out other damaging attacks on bacteria. A flipside to antibiotics is that they can rarely tell the difference between good and bad bacteria.

 *What is it about?*

Microbiology is a broad discipline that involves the study of the biology of bacteria, viruses, protozoa and fungi. The main focus of the course is the pathogenic potential of the organisms that cause disease in man. The course also covers aspects of the biochemistry, physiology and genetics of microorganisms.

Recently, our knowledge of how microbes function has expanded enormously, both in the disease process and at the molecular level. Genetic engineers use bacteria and viruses to clone eukaryotic genes to study and treat human genetic disorders. Vaccines are being developed for diseases such as AIDS, Legionnaire's disease and listeriosis.

In the areas of biotechnology, agriculture and food production, microbes are continually exploited for the benefit of man. Microbiologists are needed to do the research required for the future battle against diseases worldwide and to apply microbes in the production of food.

 *Career Prospects*

Microbiologists are in demand in medical research, quality control, and the biotechnology industry. Many such graduates secure jobs as researchers working in universities, pharmaceutical and bioscience companies and institutes.

Successful graduates of the course also progress into laboratory-based careers in clinical or technical roles which do not involve research. The transferable skills one develops also equip one well for a wide range of careers outside the lab.

There are several job opportunities for those who want to pursue a career in microbiology. Microbiologists can find job opportunities in sectors such as government and private hospitals, food industries, research and development organizations, chemical industries and pharmaceutical industries.

They can also choose a career as science writer, writing articles for professional microbiologists.

*Some of the popular professional avenues open to such graduates are:*
*Bacteriologist*
A Bacteriologist is responsible for studying various kinds of bacteria, which are constantly changing and evolving. They typically perform research in a laboratory, mostly for government or pharmaceutical agencies.    

*Virologist*
A Virologist is a professional who studies the growth, development, structure and characteristics of different viruses. He isolates and makes cultures of significant viruses in a standard inhibitory medium, controlling certain factors, like, aeration, moisture, temperature, and nutrition.    

*Mycologist*    
A Mycologist is a scientist who studies fungi that is known to be an independent organism similar to animals, algae, plants and bacteria. Mycologists study operations of organism- based processes of poisonous, edible and parasitic fungi in order to discover organisms useful in medicine, industry and agriculture.    

*Cell biologist*    
Cell biologists research and study the properties, interactions and structure of cellular molecules from which they can extrapolate basic principles or generalizations about the effects of cell behaviour on an organism. For example, looking at how certain cell behaviours contribute to the progression of cancer in the body.     

*Biochemist*    
Biochemists work with the chemical composition of living organisms and perform studies of the chemical processes involved in all basic life functions. Through research, experimentation and study, these professionals provide us with much of the background knowledge on topics like genetics and heredity.
