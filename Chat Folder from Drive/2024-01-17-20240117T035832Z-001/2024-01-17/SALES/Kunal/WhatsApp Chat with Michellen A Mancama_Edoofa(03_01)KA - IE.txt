The percentage of scholarship is determined by the following factors

1) Academic Excellence
2) Merit
3) Previous Experiences
4) Recommendations from Edoofa
5) Statement of Purpose(SOP) 
6) Extra curricular Activities

So the Universites will evaluate them to decide the final quantum of scholarship
08/01/24, 10:10 am - +263 78 761 8378: Okay okay I understand..
08/01/24, 10:10 am - +263 78 761 8378: Thank u for the briefing

08/01/24, 10:30 am - +263 78 761 8378: Okay so I told them about the visionaries of Edoofa program.That it offers EYWL program building skills n making sure candidates r employable and building a person who has a positive outlook on life.An individual who can be better than his or her peers.I also briefed them if I were found eligible for the Edoofa program I will have to cover my transportation expenses .Edoofa offers the best universities n quality education to its students.I basically spoke more on what Edoofa is all about
08/01/24, 10:44 am - Kunal: That is great
As per your understanding from the document, may I know what is the cost of education for an international student offered by Edoofa?
08/01/24, 10:47 am - +263 78 761 8378: $6000 to $8000
But if u have the $10 million Fund program it may reduce to $2000 to $3000 per year
08/01/24, 10:59 am - Kunal: That is right
So, are they comfortable with the financial aspects to proceed ahead?
08/01/24, 11:03 am - +263 78 761 8378: So u mean this $6000/$8000 m providing for myself.....??
08/01/24, 11:24 am - Kunal: No please
The reduced fee $2000 to $3000 per year
08/01/24, 11:38 am - +263 78 761 8378: Okay I was a bit stuck up on that
08/01/24, 11:55 am - Kunal: That is fine
So, are you comfortable with the cost of education?
08/01/24, 12:43 pm - Kunal: Please excuse me for some time as I am heading for my lunch. Let us connect at 1:45 pm CAT for the next part of our session. Let me know if you have any challenges with the schedule.

08/01/24, 1:54 pm - Kunal: Good Afternoon
Shall we proceed?
08/01/24, 1:55 pm - +263 78 761 8378: Afternoon
08/01/24, 1:55 pm - +263 78 761 8378: They say that they are not comfortable
08/01/24, 2:08 pm - Kunal: I do understand the challenges, did you manage to compare the cost of education in Zimbabwe with that through the Edoofa Scholarship Program?
08/01/24, 4:20 pm - +263 78 761 8378: I did compare,it seems locally the cost of education is relatively less expensive .
08/01/24, 4:38 pm - Kunal: Alright, our Senior Academician was in Zimbabwe for 4 months last year and let me highlight the importance of this opportunity for Zimbabwean students. I want you to think about this situation, where you are studying at UZ. The Tuition fee at UZ ranges from $1000-$1200 per annum with hikes most of the years. The living expenses in Zimbabwe are much more costly than in India. Even the staple diet sadza costs $1 per meal. So you have to spend around $3 per or more per day for meals. A taxi ride for a short distance costs $1, Wi-Fi costs $120 per month, the living rents are high with hikes and the unemployment rates are increasing. Many students work at petrol pumps, markets, selling SIM cards etc after graduation. You might have observed this. All in all, students studying in Zimbabwe have informed us they have to meet an expense of about $3000 or more per annum.
08/01/24, 6:22 pm - +263 78 761 8378: Okay okay..
08/01/24, 6:22 pm - +263 78 761 8378: I understand you very well Sir
08/01/24, 6:25 pm - Kunal: As you see the student is spending more than 2600 USD while studying in Zimbabwe, now through the Edoofa program the cost is much lower and there are specific courses such as BBA etc, where a child can even receive a higher quantum of scholarship. 
Apart from this, we have the Earn While You Learn program where students can self-finance and reduce the cost of education even more affordable based on their efforts and efficiency
08/01/24, 7:59 pm - +263 78 761 8378: Alright I get u .Noted
08/01/24, 8:09 pm - Kunal: Let us connect at *12:30 pm CAT Tomorrow to resume your session *(In case you have any challenges, please let me know the time you will be available, and we will schedule accordingly)*
