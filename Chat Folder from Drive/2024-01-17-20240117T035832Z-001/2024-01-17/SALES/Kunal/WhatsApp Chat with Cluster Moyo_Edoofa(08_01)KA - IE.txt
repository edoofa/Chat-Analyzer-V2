This is different from other scholarships and also i chose edoofa because of the earn while you learn program which helps reduce your expenses at the University in short i can say that is the reason why i chose edoofa
08/01/24, 5:25 pm - +27 67 572 5403: I've already included some of my understandings there. I also understood that edoofa scholarship program is not a charity fund and also it is there to make children who can not afford higher education  abroad get the chance to get it by making the process easier and cheaper.
08/01/24, 5:27 pm - Kunal: I am glad to see your understanding of the Edoofa program and appreciate your aspirations, let me guide you further to gain more knowledge on this opportunity.

08/01/24, 5:59 pm - +27 67 572 5403: My name is Cluster Moyo i am 20 years old , i did my ordinary level at Samahuru Adventist High and then did my Advanced level at Nkulumane high school  my Advanced level combination was mathematics, statistics, Geography, cropscience and Communication skills. I love being involved around mathematical and statistical tools and problems because i love the challenge that they give to me yet as well i love reading so much but not as compared to calculations. As for my weakness I'm not sure of them as i haven't seen any besides for temper . I come from a family of 5 Mom, Dad , my big brother , young brother and I . My way hasn't been easy from primary to high school as my mother hasn't been working, the person who has been taking care of us financially  is my father before they broke up , but he tried all his best up until i wrote my ordinary level and  from then that's when he didn't proceed with helping me going further  . I wrote my Advanced level last year so currently i am waiting for my results and i would like to study Actuarial science as i have once said before i love playing around mathematical tools so Actuarial science deals with a lot of mathematical tools which makes me be interested in studying it . Actuarial scientists can deal with stress conditions and other life challenging problems easily that also made me to have the enthusiasm y
to study it . My father is a truck driver and my mother is a waiter as for education my mother wrote her ordinary level and also my Dad and they didn't proceed going further because of financial  instability from their families .  I have two brothers my old brother is not working currently and my young brother is in form 2 this year , financially  i have been supported by my father and my Uncle up until i wrote  A level . My aunty and uncle will be supporting me for my higher education as for my school fees per term it was 80 USD .
08/01/24, 6:10 pm - Kunal: ,Thank you for sharing in detail, I am glad to hear and learn more about you. I am delighted that you expressed yourself genuinely.
