Lastly  medical laboratory technology
04/01/24, 3:38 pm - +265 986 93 76 47: Like if we are given three options and I put
Pharmacy as my first  choice 
Then physiotherapy 
Lastly 
Medical laboratory technology 

Is it possible  to be redirected to pursue the second  or the third option

Or being redirected  to pursue  a course that  I didn't  apply for
04/01/24, 3:50 pm - Kunal: Please note that you can change your course only while being in Malawi, during the Admissions Process. But I would recommend opting for the second or third option considering the fact that I can recommend your application for a higher quantum of scholarship
04/01/24, 3:54 pm - +265 986 93 76 47: OK 
If so then  let me go for physiotherapy
04/01/24, 3:55 pm - Kunal: Well noted
As we've thoroughly covered the course details can you tell me how you see yourself in 5 years after your course and If you are provided with this career option and how can being an Edoofian enable you to achieve your career goals?
04/01/24, 4:02 pm - +265 986 93 76 47: In five years after completing the physiotherapy course, I envision myself working as a skilled and knowledgeable physiotherapist, making a positive impact on the lives of my patients. I see myself working in a reputable healthcare facility, collaborating with a team of healthcare professionals to provide comprehensive care to patients in need.

Being an Edoofian can greatly enable me to achieve my career goals in several ways. Firstly, Edoofian's physiotherapy course provides a strong foundation of theoretical knowledge and practical skills necessary for success in the field. The course curriculum is designed to equip students with the latest advancements and best practices in physiotherapy, ensuring that I am up-to-date with the industry standards.

Additionally, Edoofian offers opportunities for hands-on experience through internships and clinical placements. These practical experiences will allow me to apply the knowledge gained during the course in real-world settings, further enhancing my skills and confidence as a physiotherapist.

Furthermore, Edoofian's strong network of alumni and industry connections can provide valuable networking opportunities and potential job placements. By being part of the Edoofian community, I can tap into this network to seek mentorship, guidance, and potential employment opportunities, which can accelerate my career growth.

Overall, being an Edoofian will not only provide me with the necessary knowledge and skills but also offer a supportive community and resources to help me achieve my career goals in the field of physiotherapy.
04/01/24, 4:02 pm - Kunal: I appreciate and admire your foresightedness at the same time. I believe you will be researching more about the course in detail.

So now as you are aware that Edoofa Recommends *India* as a Higher Education Platform
May I know what is your knowledge or what have you researched about India and the Indian Education System?
04/01/24, 4:05 pm - +265 986 93 76 47: Yes of course,  I will be searching
04/01/24, 4:06 pm - Kunal: You can address the question as well
04/01/24, 4:07 pm - +265 986 93 76 47: OK thanks

04/01/24, 4:16 pm - Kunal: Well, I am sure after seeing all these amazing facts, you are intrigued to study in India. So can you now tell me, How would studying in India implement a positive impact on your career and How do you aim to achieve your career aspirations from studying in India?
04/01/24, 4:30 pm - +265 986 93 76 47: This message was deleted
04/01/24, 4:34 pm - +265 986 93 76 47: studying in India can provide me with a unique set of experiences and opportunities that can contribute to my personal and professional growth. It is important to make the most of these opportunities and actively work towards achieving my career aspirations
04/01/24, 4:34 pm - Kunal: Amazing!
As I can see, you have understood the quality of higher education  which Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead.

By any chance are you familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship?
04/01/24, 4:36 pm - +265 986 93 76 47: Nope,  may u tell me
04/01/24, 4:36 pm - Kunal: Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth! 

In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc,it is still beyond the reach of many.
With the Edoofa Scholarship Program,the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library,Wifi,Laundry,etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
04/01/24, 4:36 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
04/01/24, 4:36 pm - Kunal: In simple words what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost $3000 or less a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well. 

However, as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even after this we allow the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.

*So do you feel the reduced cost of education is affordable to your family?*
04/01/24, 4:46 pm - +265 986 93 76 47: $1,500 USD to Malawi kwacha (MWK) at an exchange rate of approximately 1 USD to 888.5 MWK would be 1,333,250 MWK.

They said they  can't  raise such a  huge money. 

Their business can not make it to that.
04/01/24, 4:51 pm - Kunal: I do understand the genuine challenge, have you compared the reduced cost with that of studying in Malawi?
04/01/24, 4:52 pm - +265 986 93 76 47: Nope
04/01/24, 4:55 pm - +265 986 93 76 47: Not yet
04/01/24, 4:57 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
04/01/24, 4:57 pm - Kunal: Yearly that is :
Accommodation yearly- MK500, 000
Food yearly- MK300, 000 
WiFi-it depends on how bundles are 
Upkeep- MK450, 000
Total- MK 1,250,000 and above
04/01/24, 4:57 pm - Kunal: Chimwemwe, we have a lot of students from Malawi who apply for their higher education for the Edoofa Scholarship Program. There are students who have discontinued their course in Malawi and are now a part of the Edoofa program because the cost of education is lower than that of Malawi
04/01/24, 4:57 pm - Kunal: We also have students who applied for Masters and they have shared their Bachelors fee break up in Malawi and it was around $2000 including tuition,, food, Accommodation, Wifi, etc. This is an example given by one such student and the fee notification from UNIMA. 

Now, I have gone through your discussions and academic background and you can even be recommended for a higher quantum of scholarship based on your performance in the upcoming sessions and evaluation of our Admissions Team.
04/01/24, 5:14 pm - +265 986 93 76 47: Thank you so much
04/01/24, 5:14 pm - Kunal: Let me tell you how Edoofa helps students bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the 

*Earn While You Learn Program*

The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
04/01/24, 5:14 pm - Kunal: Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.


The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in. <This message was edited>
04/01/24, 5:15 pm - Kunal: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
04/01/24, 5:15 pm - Kunal: *Projects with Brands and Companies: -*
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:
Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0
Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
04/01/24, 5:15 pm - Kunal: *Recruitment Partners: -*
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics
04/01/24, 5:15 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
04/01/24, 5:15 pm - Kunal: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.


These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases.
04/01/24, 5:15 pm - Kunal: What are your views on the same? Do you think this will be benefiting from the Earn WHile You Learn Program?
04/01/24, 5:21 pm - +265 986 93 76 47: Yes 
This will be benefiting
04/01/24, 5:22 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
04/01/24, 5:22 pm - +265 986 93 76 47: OK thank you
05/01/24, 9:37 am - +265 986 93 76 47: Good morning
05/01/24, 9:40 am - Kunal: It is good to hear from you, Chimwemwe
05/01/24, 9:40 am - Kunal: <Media omitted>
05/01/24, 9:40 am - Kunal: Absolutely,
If I have to help you explain how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable compared to Local Universities, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now, if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, bringing the cost further down to $1000 per year including the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month. _This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly._

*You can see this even in this scholarship credit certificate where one of our star performers, our Proud Edoodians  Masinire Miriam earned $1965 within a year.* I hope you can now realize the power of the EWYL program to reduce the financial pressure on families.
05/01/24, 9:52 am - +265 986 93 76 47: Yes I have realized the power of the EWYL
05/01/24, 9:53 am - +265 986 93 76 47: THIS IS AWESOME
05/01/24, 9:53 am - Kunal: Indeed it is
Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counseling : 

 1. *Expert Career Counseling*: We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counselors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.
05/01/24, 9:53 am - Kunal: 2. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off
05/01/24, 9:53 am - Kunal: 3. *Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What's more, students earn
05/01/24, 9:53 am - Kunal: *4.*Higher Education Concierge*: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education*.

After going through the facts that make Edoofa different.

05/01/24, 10:05 am - Kunal: There is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it  depends upon his/her hard work.
However may I know, who will be helping you with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
05/01/24, 10:06 am - +265 986 93 76 47: My uncle
05/01/24, 10:06 am - Kunal: That's completely understandable,
So, I believe you'll be discussing everything with them after we complete today's session. Also after our counseling session I would connect to some of our Beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know the proceedings well.

So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
05/01/24, 10:08 am - +265 986 93 76 47: They are very happy,  being the fact that I'm  the first  person  to go to university.  They are very  proud  of me.
05/01/24, 10:09 am - +265 986 93 76 47: I mean in our family
05/01/24, 10:13 am - Kunal: I am glad to hear that, as studying Internationally would make your career advance at even a greater pace, as you will be transformed to a professional with a Greater Paying Job, which would actually help you in uplifting your family thereby yourself, and provide a peaceful and hassle free life to your parents.
05/01/24, 10:13 am - Kunal: *As we move to the last part of the session, let me highlight a few requirements while a student applies alone* 

*1) Application Form* -An online or offline form that asks for your personal details and academic background.

*2) Statement of Purpose-* An essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and your aspirations for your career.

*3) Letter of Recommendation-* from Senior authorities, School Heads or others on why they recommend you to be a right fit for an international university.
Do you know about other requirements?
05/01/24, 11:09 am - Kunal: Are we connected?
05/01/24, 11:13 am - +265 986 93 76 47: Yes
05/01/24, 11:13 am - Kunal: Please address this
05/01/24, 11:14 am - +265 986 93 76 47: No, I do not know
05/01/24, 11:16 am - Kunal: Let me guide you ahead
When a student applies alone for an international University, on average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose costs between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally and act as a major parameter to decide the child’s eligibility. If you apply to 5 Universities, the average costs for the mentioned would be $1350-$1750, *without even receiving a guarantee to be selected*

*Edoofa has identified a solution for this uncertainty and unaffordability.* If a student qualifies after the eligibility check, not only does Edoofa help them draft their statement of purpose but also helps in terms of Visa Documentation Assistance, University Session and selection, Individual mentorship, etc, reducing the costs significantly to $750 which is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
05/01/24, 11:17 am - Kunal: <Media omitted>
05/01/24, 11:17 am - +265 986 93 76 47: About school  heads,  I went  to Zingwangwa secondary school which is in blantyre
Now I'm  in thyolo
05/01/24, 11:19 am - +265 986 93 76 47: Yes why  the fee is paid????
05/01/24, 11:20 am - Kunal: Noted Chimwemwe
05/01/24, 11:20 am - Kunal: The enrollment fee is to be paid only if a child is found eligible for the Edoofa Scholarship Program after passing the eligibility check stage, it includes, 

*Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
*Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
*Earn While You Learn Program and training*
*University sessions and selection*
*A guaranteed scholarship seat*
*Visa Documentation Assistance*
*The Foster and Care throughout the course of an Edoofian*
05/01/24, 11:20 am - Kunal: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge due to which parents might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short period of 7 days and for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option wherein if the student is found eligible, instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, *parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days thereby reducing the financial pressure.*
05/01/24, 11:25 am - +265 986 93 76 47: I'm going  to tell them
05/01/24, 11:27 am - Kunal: <Media omitted>

05/01/24, 11:35 am - Kunal: That is right.We had very well covered till the Acceptance Letter and Enrollment formalities which is in stage 4.Even though we had mentioned stages 5 and 6 briefly we are left with some more information from the last two stages
So shall I explain it to you
05/01/24, 11:36 am - +265 986 93 76 47: Yes u can
05/01/24, 11:36 am - +265 986 93 76 47: May u
05/01/24, 11:37 am - Kunal: Step 5: After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors , they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by making a payment of the registration fee within a few weeks.
05/01/24, 11:37 am - Kunal: This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself and after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).
05/01/24, 11:37 am - Kunal: Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment,you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.

I hope you are clear with the process.
05/01/24, 11:40 am - +265 986 93 76 47: More than  clear
05/01/24, 11:46 am - Kunal: Alright, we have come to the end of your counselling session. Before I guide you Step 2 of the Eligibility Check, I want you to have a full-fledged discussion of the Edoofa program within your family as higher education is supposed to be a family decision. Ensure to include these aspects during the discussions:-

*About the EDOOFA Program and its vision of making Education Affordable and Edoofians Employment Ready.*
*Value of the career of an Edoofian after pursuing higher education in India.*
*The financial aspects and how Edoofa brings in affordability and self-financing opportunities for students.*
05/01/24, 11:46 am - Kunal: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences,

15/01/24, 9:43 am - +265 986 93 76 47: During a recent family gathering,  the topic of the  Edoofa scholarship program sparked an engaging and insightful discussion. As a family,  we delved deeper into the details of the program, our perspectives began to evolve, leading to a variety of thoughts and opinions. 

I expressed my enthusiasm for the Edoofa scholarship program recognizing its potential to provide life-changing  opportunities for deserving students. I highlighted the program's emphasis on holistic development,  including mentorship and career guidance as a key factor that sets it apart from other scholarships. 

My uncle and aunt,  Mr and Mrs  Ngaiyaye,  were impressed  by the  Edoofa scholarship program's commitment to empowering students from  disadvantaged backgrounds.  They appreciated how the program aimed to bridge the gap between education and employability,  ensuring that students  not only receive financial aid but also gain the  necessary skills to thrive in their chosen fields. 
As we continued our discussion,  we realized that the Edoofa  scholarship program's impact  extends beyond the individual students.  It has the potential to uplift entire communities and  contribute to the  overall development of society.  This realization further solidified our support for the program.
15/01/24, 1:17 pm - Kunal: Good Afternoon, everyone
I hope you are having a wonderful day

I am here to begin with the session, shall we proceed?

15/01/24, 1:44 pm - Kunal: Excellent, well it seems that you took your family through the entire conversation which we did during your counselling session! May I know if your family has any questions for me?
15/01/24, 2:47 pm - +265 986 93 76 47: They  just want to know more about the journey of going to india, how safe it is???
15/01/24, 2:48 pm - Kunal: Being parents, the concern regarding the welfare and personal development of their child is absolutely understandable. 

To give a glimpse, we have a community of more than 2500 Zimbabweans with  300+ associate schools from Zimbabwe with a panel of Headmasters, teachers, and parents, who have been bringing success stories of Edoofians for the past 14+ years due to the kind of foster and care that we provide throughout their course!

With UGC-approved Universities whose degrees are Globally accredited, and which have all security and healthcare facilities including counselling departments, Edoofians are exposed to a conducive environment that motivates them to focus on their career and achieve their dreams. There are Zimbabwean Communities at Every University so no child will feel lonely. Moreover, our Admission Team, EWYL(Earn While You Learn) mentor and counsellor of a student will be available to him/her throughout the course. At any point, if the student or parent needs assistance we will be readily accessible. This is the reason why Edoofa is known as a *Higher Education Concierge!*

The Universities are strict in terms of the welfare of children. Being in Zimbabwe itself, your parents will be able to track the happenings, academic performance, and University details

15/01/24, 5:50 pm - Kunal: That is fine, 

May I know the thoughts and opinions of your family regarding the financial aspects such as enrollment fees and cost of education, please
15/01/24, 5:54 pm - +265 986 93 76 47: How much all those will cost????
15/01/24, 5:55 pm - Kunal: May I know if you recall the financial aspects which were discussed in the session?
15/01/24, 5:56 pm - +265 986 93 76 47: $2000-3000
15/01/24, 6:06 pm - Kunal: That is correct
15/01/24, 6:06 pm - Kunal: So, please address this
15/01/24, 6:10 pm - +265 986 93 76 47: $3000 is about  2.4 million in Malawi kwacha. 
He said he can afford 1.2 million Malawi kwacha only
15/01/24, 6:19 pm - Kunal: I understand
15/01/24, 6:25 pm - Kunal: Even though, the cost of education through the Edoofa Scholarship ranges from $2000-$3000 per annum, based on your performance in the eligibility check stage and evaluation of our Admissions team, you can be considered for a higher quantum of scholarship which can reduce the costs even below $2000 inclusive of tuition and living.
15/01/24, 6:25 pm - Kunal: Since you have performed well in the Academics and sessions so far, I will be recommending your application for a higher quantum of scholarship which would also depend on the evaluation during interviews and of our Admissions Team
15/01/24, 6:41 pm - Kunal: Please excuse me for some time as I am heading for a Board meeting. Let us connect at 7:40 pm CAT for the next part of our session. Let me know if you have any challenge with the schedule.

16/01/24, 11:56 am - +265 986 93 76 47: Is it possible to change  the course 

Most of students do not love agriculture 

So I want to do that course
16/01/24, 12:04 pm - Kunal: Most of the students do not love agriculture, this is why you wish to do agriculture?
16/01/24, 12:10 pm - +265 986 93 76 47: That's not the true reason,  the thing is 
I love agriculture that much
And it was my wish to go to university that offers agriculture courses 
But when I was in form 1
My friend asked me,  about  a university I wish to go
Then I was like any that offers agri courses 
He laughed at me,  he said why I'm going to school  just to play with soil in the future
16/01/24, 12:17 pm - +265 986 93 76 47: Then I changed my mind,   
Starting from  there I wished do do healthy related programs. 
But I love farming,  I even had a garden. 
After my form four in 2022
I was selected to pursue agricultural economics at Lilongwe university of agriculture and natural resources (luanar) 
But I'm a first year student at luanar 
But bcoz my uncle can't afford the fee of luanar 
That's why I'm  applying for  Edoofa scholarship program
