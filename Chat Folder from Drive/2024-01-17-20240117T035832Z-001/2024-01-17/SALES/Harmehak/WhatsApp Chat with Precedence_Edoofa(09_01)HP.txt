We are associated with more than 200 schools in Zimbabwe. Some of the most elite Schools in Zimbabawe example in Harare we are collaborated with St. Dominic’s Chishawasha, Dominican Convent, Christ Ministries and many others.

13/01/24, 1:53 pm - +263 78 255 3611: l do understand that a scholarship can only be  earned on the basis of merit,talent and attitude
13/01/24, 1:53 pm - +263 78 255 3611: Yes they are willing to

I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start?
15/01/24, 10:13 am - +263 78 255 3611: Yes we can
15/01/24, 10:13 am - Harmehak: I await your response
15/01/24, 10:37 am - +263 78 255 3611: l understand that students will be able to pay $2000us to $3000 with the help of Edoofa and it will be cheap for them as compared to other universities without scholarships
15/01/24, 10:37 am - +263 78 255 3611: Also scholarship percentage 50%-100%on tuition fee,, so every student will be given the percentage according to his or her merit,, talent and attitude
15/01/24, 10:42 am - Harmehak: Yes please.
15/01/24, 10:43 am - Harmehak: Did you discuss the learnings from the document with your parents, Precedence?
15/01/24, 10:44 am - +263 78 255 3611: No l didn't because we are not together for now
15/01/24, 10:45 am - Harmehak: I understand,

Meanwhile what is your take on the finances and affordability?
15/01/24, 10:50 am - +263 78 255 3611: It's quite good but as for me and my parents we can't afford such amount of money,, $2000  because my parents will be paying for me and my siblings sooo it will be hard for them to balance us
15/01/24, 10:52 am - +263 78 255 3611: That's why l am begging for your help with the good percentage of scholarship
15/01/24, 10:52 am - +263 78 255 3611: l really wish to advance my studies in India
15/01/24, 10:57 am - Harmehak: I do understand, Precedence.
15/01/24, 10:57 am - Harmehak: In simple words Precedence, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
15/01/24, 10:57 am - Harmehak: However as per my experience, I can share with you that *if you are able to perform and clear all these criteria with a high passing grade, you would be eligible for higher quantum of Scholarship*, in which you will just have to pay a minimal fee of *$1200-$1800*, Which would cover your entire fees be it food, accommodation, Tuition etc.

What are your thoughts on the same?
15/01/24, 11:00 am - +263 78 255 3611: That's good
15/01/24, 11:00 am - +263 78 255 3611: This will be better
15/01/24, 11:07 am - Harmehak: I appreciate.

What is your take on the finances now considering you also have the Earn While You Learn Program?
15/01/24, 11:13 am - +263 78 255 3611: l think it will be good for us because it will be cheap n easier for my family
15/01/24, 11:20 am - Harmehak: I understand,

Would they be willing to support you for the same?
15/01/24, 11:20 am - +263 78 255 3611: Yes
15/01/24, 11:24 am - Harmehak: Duly noted.

May I know why you haven't pursued your education after A level, Precedence?
15/01/24, 2:24 pm - +263 78 255 3611: Goof afternoon
15/01/24, 2:24 pm - +263 78 255 3611: *Good afternoon
15/01/24, 2:27 pm - Harmehak: I am expecting to hear from you!
15/01/24, 2:34 pm - +263 78 255 3611: My parents failed to send me to school because of lack of money
15/01/24, 2:34 pm - +263 78 255 3611: They didn't afford the feew
15/01/24, 2:34 pm - +263 78 255 3611: *fees
15/01/24, 2:36 pm - Harmehak: I understand!

So what is their financial plan to support you now, Precedence?
15/01/24, 2:41 pm - +263 78 255 3611: l think they can only support me with $1000
15/01/24, 2:43 pm - Harmehak: Precedence, Senior Academician Mr Piyush were in Zimbabwe for about 90 days, from his experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,

While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time. 

This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year. 

What is your take on the same? <This message was edited>
15/01/24, 3:19 pm - +263 78 255 3611: Yes that's true bt it depends,, not all people lives like that
