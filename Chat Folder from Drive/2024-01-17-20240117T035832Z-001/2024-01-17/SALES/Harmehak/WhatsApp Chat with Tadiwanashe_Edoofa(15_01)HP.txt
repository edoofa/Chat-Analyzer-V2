You can address me as *Ms. Harmehak and we do have with us, Mr. Piyush who is the Head of Counseling and Mr. Jyotishman who is the Head of Admissions* and will be evaluating your responses for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
16/01/24, 9:59 am - +263 77 737 4326: Okay ma'am thank you one again
16/01/24, 10:01 am - Harmehak: So now can you please tell me, what is your understanding of the Edoofa Scholarship Program and what all did you happen to learn?
16/01/24, 10:06 am - +263 77 737 4326: What l under stand about it is that it is a hundred percent scholarship in India where it helps students world wide and l learnt that it is a good program that helps us reach out destination
16/01/24, 10:06 am - Harmehak: Well received, now, let me share more about the program with you.

You see, *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4000 students from different African countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
16/01/24, 10:06 am - Harmehak: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program. 
We are associated with more than 200 schools in Zimbabwe. Some of the most elite Schools in Zimbabawe example in Harare we are collaborated with St. Dominic’s Chishawasha, Dominican Convent, Christ Ministries and many others. In Manicaland we have a total of 18 Schools to name a few St. David’s Girls Bonda, Hartzell High, First Class, First Choice and so on.  Chipinge we have Chibuwe High School, you would be happy to know that the DEO’s of Mutare and Chipinge have their kids under the Edoofa Scholarship. Masvingo we have 24 Schools collaborated with over 300 students from some of the best schools example Pamushana, St. Antony’s, Reformed Church Gutu, Zaka High and many others. The program is also appreciated by the Education Inspector of Bikita Madam Makomeke.We have more than 500 students from Mashonaland (West, Central and East) Province, Midlands Province.  Last but not the Least we also have Schools from Bulawayo and Matebaland South associated with Edoofa. 

Our collaborations with the UCE College Bulawayo adds a feather to the Cap of trust that Edoofa has built in a span of 14 years. 

The Schools, Institutions and Educationists who have made efforts to train the students for this prestigious Scholarship Program are also the Authorized Designatories of EDOOFA in Zimbabawe. 
We have Mr. Shorwi Kawadza (Retd. Headmaster Hartzell), Mr. Charles Jerera (Retd. Ministry of Education), Ms. Christina Rockson (Founder and Principal of Hilltop Christian College in SA) who have shown relentless efforts to guide students on the right path to success.EDOOFA boasts a proud students and parents community of more than 2000 from Zimbabwe who are happy with the quality of education and the employability outcomes.
16/01/24, 10:08 am - +263 77 737 4326: Wow this is amazing
16/01/24, 10:11 am - Harmehak: I appreciate!

So may I know your understanding of a 100% scholarship?
16/01/24, 10:19 am - +263 77 737 4326: Okay
16/01/24, 10:20 am - +263 77 737 4326: Hundred percent scholarship is when the Edoofa will be paying all your bills including tuition fee and department fee l think that's all
16/01/24, 10:27 am - Harmehak: Received
16/01/24, 10:27 am - Harmehak: Let me explain to you that there are two kinds of programs that provide assistance to the students because a lot of times parents and students themselves misunderstand what a Scholarship actually means.

*1. Scholarships*
*2. Sponsorships*

Scholarships make education *affordable* for the students by reducing their *Tuition Fees*, now a lot of times parents and students consider that a Domestic Scholarship would be the same as an International Scholarship, but to understand the difference between them, consider yourself applying for an education in your own country with the help of a scholarship. Now after the scholarship when your tuition fee would be reduced, eventually your entire cost of education would be reduced because being a citizen of the country, you wouldn't be required to spend any fees on Accommodation and feeding separately since in that case, students would be staying with their families. However, if I personally plan to study in Zimbabwe with the same scholarship, I would have to incur some costs on Accommodation and Feeding because I am not a Zimbabwean Citizen. So a lot of times parents and students consider International Scholarship and Domestic Scholarship one and the same thing, but in reality, they aren't.

Sponsorships, on the other hand, take care entirely of a student's education, but because Sponsorships are provided by only a few organizations, there are a lot of terms and conditions which a student might need to follow in order to get the sponsorship, the most common term is that a student after completion of the course would have to work for the organization providing the sponsorship for a period of time.
16/01/24, 10:38 am - +263 77 737 4326: Ooh okay now l get it
16/01/24, 10:39 am - Harmehak: That's good
16/01/24, 10:39 am - Harmehak: I feel you too are looking for something like this, so that just like these students you can cater for your higher education by your own self and help your parents reduce their financial burden, isn't it?
16/01/24, 10:43 am - +263 77 737 4326: Yes
16/01/24, 10:45 am - Harmehak: *Alright so Tadiwanashe, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.*

I would like to know you better as a student so please go ahead, tell me a bit about yourself, your education, how much USD Gumbonzvanda high charges you every term, along with what do you wish to study, your strengths and weaknesses, and your hobbies, since I honestly don't know a lot about you?

And with that a detailed description of your family background, what do your parents do *(Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work)?*, what is their highest education level along with if you have any siblings, please?
16/01/24, 10:52 am - +263 77 737 4326: Okay at Gumbonzvanda high school we used to pay 300 USD per term then 90 USD for extra lessons ,l wish to study civil engineering or to be an environmental health technician 
My strengths is in studying mostly and praying and l love chatting with different people basically am a free person and a simple one
My weakness is l cry shortly when am hurt even with a small thing 
I really love playing girls soccer and netball l would wish one day to play in a world cup and l sing too

Do you believe it's a life changing decision?
16/01/24, 11:27 am - +263 77 737 4326: Yes l believe
16/01/24, 11:30 am - Harmehak: Very well,

Would you add that you are mentally prepared for a life abroad too?
16/01/24, 11:32 am - +263 77 737 4326: Yes am well prepared for everything

16/01/24, 12:08 pm - Harmehak: May I know about the final support?
16/01/24, 12:08 pm - Harmehak: I am referring to your mother itself.
16/01/24, 12:09 pm - +263 77 737 4326: Okay wait for her she will reply soon
16/01/24, 12:11 pm - Harmehak: I do understand,

However did you discuss regarding the application with your mother earlier?
16/01/24, 12:13 pm - +263 77 737 4326: Yes l did
16/01/24, 12:13 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

16/01/24, 2:21 pm - Harmehak: I am expecting to hear from you Tadiwanashe!
16/01/24, 3:39 pm - +263 77 737 4326: Okay
16/01/24, 3:40 pm - Harmehak: May I know the reason behind such delayed responses, Tadiwanashe?
16/01/24, 3:42 pm - +263 77 737 4326: My phone was off there was no electricity am sorry
16/01/24, 3:43 pm - +263 77 737 4326: O level its 7 subjects 
A level 7 points Crop science B,Economics E and Business studies D
16/01/24, 3:43 pm - Harmehak: I do understand.
16/01/24, 3:43 pm - Harmehak: Received please!
16/01/24, 3:43 pm - Harmehak: So what motivates you to study Civil Engineering?
16/01/24, 3:48 pm - +263 77 737 4326: Jus want to be in engineering industry and constructing roads
16/01/24, 3:49 pm - Harmehak: While that's great,

May I know what all did you research regarding the requirements of Engineering, Tadiwanashe?
16/01/24, 3:50 pm - +263 77 737 4326: Okay
16/01/24, 3:50 pm - Harmehak: Yes please?
16/01/24, 3:53 pm - +263 77 737 4326: Civil engineering is the study of designing, constructing, and maintaining infrastructure such as buildings, roads, bridges, dams, and other large-scale construction projects. It involves the application of scientific and mathematical principles to solve problems related to the built environment. Civil engineers also work to ensure that these structures are safe, sustainable, and environmentally friendly. They may also be involved in urban planning, environmental engineering, and transportation systems.
16/01/24, 3:56 pm - Harmehak: That's very correct,

However I am referring to the requirements of Civil Engineering.

That is the subjects required.
16/01/24, 3:57 pm - +263 77 737 4326: It needs science subjects
16/01/24, 4:04 pm - Harmehak: Very correct!
16/01/24, 4:04 pm - Harmehak: Physics and mathematics are a mandatory requirement.
16/01/24, 4:04 pm - Harmehak: Why didn't you pursue the same in your A level?
16/01/24, 4:13 pm - +263 77 737 4326: Hmmm l couldn't pursue them because l  wasn't that good at sciences
16/01/24, 4:14 pm - Harmehak: I do understand.
16/01/24, 4:14 pm - Harmehak: Since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*. whereas if they want to study any Engineering Course then they should have *Physics and Maths* in their A level mandatorily.
16/01/24, 4:15 pm - Harmehak: Along with the same Physics and Mathematics are a mandatory requirement for Engineering in Zimbabwe too, Tadiwanashe!
16/01/24, 4:15 pm - +263 77 737 4326: Ooh okay
16/01/24, 4:15 pm - +263 77 737 4326: Meaning to say l can't do engineering without these two
16/01/24, 4:18 pm - Harmehak: Unfortunately you cannot either in India or Zimbabwe, Tadiwanashe.
16/01/24, 4:18 pm - +263 77 737 4326: Yes
16/01/24, 4:19 pm - +263 77 737 4326: So is there any other course that l would do
16/01/24, 4:19 pm - Harmehak: May I know why you chose this subject combination, Tadiwanashe!
16/01/24, 4:19 pm - Harmehak: Yes please, we will discuss!
16/01/24, 4:20 pm - +263 77 737 4326: Sure
16/01/24, 4:21 pm - +263 77 963 6509: But in Zimbabwe one can do at polytechnical colleges
16/01/24, 4:22 pm - Harmehak: Physics and Mathematics are a mandatory requirement for Engineering, Mrs Tapiwa.
16/01/24, 4:23 pm - +263 77 737 4326: From my point of view l see it as easy subjects to do
16/01/24, 4:23 pm - +263 77 963 6509: What about Safety health and  Environmental management course ,do u offer it
16/01/24, 4:24 pm - Harmehak: I do understand!

So which other fields are you inclined towards, Tadiwanashe?

As per your results I believe Bachelors in Business administration would be a great choice for you!
16/01/24, 4:24 pm - Harmehak: I will surely regarding that too!
16/01/24, 4:26 pm - Harmehak: Polytechnic college would provide you with diploma level of education, Mrs Tapiwa, isn't it?
16/01/24, 4:26 pm - +263 77 963 6509: Something related to environment not business
16/01/24, 4:26 pm - +263 77 963 6509: Yes
16/01/24, 4:26 pm - +263 77 963 6509: Then 2years BTech at university
16/01/24, 4:29 pm - Harmehak: Mrs Tapiwa, that was a question for Tadiwanashe concerning her interests and results itself.
16/01/24, 4:29 pm - Harmehak: I will brief you about Environmental studies.
16/01/24, 4:55 pm - +263 77 737 4326: I want something related to environment not business
16/01/24, 4:58 pm - Harmehak: That has been noted, Tadiwanashe.

However I can see you have inclination towards science subjects.

The same being the reason I questioned as to why you didn't pursue sciences in A level.

However, now let me assist you with Environmental studies.
16/01/24, 4:58 pm - Harmehak: A Bachelor in Geography degree can provide a solid foundation for a career in the field of geology. Some of the common career paths for Geography graduates with an interest in geology include:

Geologist: Study the physical characteristics and processes of the Earth, including its rocks, minerals, and oil and gas resources.

Environmental Geologist: Assess and manage the impact of human activities on the environment, such as the impact of mining and oil and gas extraction.

Hydrogeologist: Study the distribution and movement of water underground and on the surface of the Earth.

Petroleum Geologist: Explore for and evaluate oil and gas reserves.

16/01/24, 5:17 pm - +263 77 737 4326: Okay noted
16/01/24, 5:18 pm - Harmehak: So far, do you have any queries for me?
16/01/24, 5:35 pm - +263 77 737 4326: No l don't have
16/01/24, 5:36 pm - Harmehak: Duly noted.
