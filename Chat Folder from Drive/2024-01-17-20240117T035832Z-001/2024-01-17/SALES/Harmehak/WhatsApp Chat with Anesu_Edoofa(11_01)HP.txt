We are associated with more than 200 schools in Zimbabwe. Some of the most elite Schools in Zimbabawe example in Harare we are collaborated with St. Dominic’s Chishawasha, Dominican Convent, Christ Ministries and many others.

12/01/24, 10:39 am - Harmehak: Do ensure active participation, Anesu.
12/01/24, 10:44 am - +263 78 120 2514: Sorry about that the network here is a bit slow
12/01/24, 10:45 am - +263 78 120 2514: Ok I'm following
12/01/24, 10:49 am - +263 78 120 2514: *International Student Admission Eligibility Check:*

a) Nature of the Scholarship: Partial Scholarship or Fully Funded
Ans: Fully Funded 

b) Cost of Education after the Edoofa scholarship: $1500-$3000 or $6000-$8000
Ans: $6000-$8000

c) What, in your understanding, is the purpose of the EWYL Program? (Answer in 30-50 words)
Ans: I have understood that the EWYL program serves the purpose of providing under privileged People and people who have have the desire to study abroad with the Opportunity to study abroad and persue their studies in an Environment that is friendly and beneficial 
I also understand that students do not just benefit educationaly but even socially and spiritual through participating in Community events 

d) Why do you believe you should be accepted into the Edoofa Program? (Answer in 50-100 words)
Ans: I believe that I should be part of the Edoofa Program because I am gifted Educationally and I am willing to learn new things from the program and acquire new skills to put them to use in future and I am also keen to get involved in the Educational system of a different environment and It is my desire to study abroad but I always thought there is no window of opportunity for such a thing but The Edoofa Program has given a ray of hope and I hope I qm one of the deserving students 

e) Are your parents aware of the details shared above? If yes, will your parents/guardians be part of the admissions process?
Ans: Yes 

f) Slot for interview session:
12/01/24, 10:57 am - Harmehak: Your answer 1 and 2 are incorrect.
12/01/24, 10:57 am - Harmehak: May I know your understanding of a fully funded scholarship, Anesu?
12/01/24, 11:00 am - +263 78 120 2514: I believe that it is a scholarship that you have all the expenses paid for by the program
12/01/24, 11:07 am - Harmehak: Actually you are mistaken over here, let me explain to you that there are two kinds of programs that provide assistance to the students because a lot of times parents and students themselves misunderstand what a Scholarship actually means.

*1. Scholarships*
*2. Sponsorships*

Scholarships make education *affordable* for the students by reducing their *Tuition Fees*, now a lot of times parents and students consider that a Domestic Scholarship would be the same as an International Scholarship, but to understand the difference between them, consider yourself applying for an education in your own country with the help of a scholarship. Now after the scholarship when your tuition fee would be reduced, eventually your entire cost of education would be reduced because being a citizen of the country, you wouldn't be required to spend any fees on Accommodation and feeding separately since in that case, students would be staying with their families. However, if I personally plan to study in Zimbabwe with the same scholarship, I would have to incur some costs on Accommodation and Feeding because I am not a Zimbabwean Citizen. So a lot of times parents and students consider International Scholarship and Domestic Scholarship one and the same thing, but in reality, they aren't.

Sponsorships, on the other hand, take care entirely of a student's education, but because Sponsorships are provided by only a few organizations, there are a lot of terms and conditions which a student might need to follow in order to get the sponsorship, the most common term is that a student after completion of the course would have to work for the organization providing the sponsorship for a period of time.
12/01/24, 1:20 pm - +263 78 120 2514: Oooj ok thanks for the enlightenment I was completely in the dark and I had the wrong idea of a scholarship
12/01/24, 1:25 pm - Harmehak: I understand
12/01/24, 1:25 pm - Harmehak: Now would you like to ask anything?
12/01/24, 4:55 pm - Harmehak: I was expecting your response, so I would be scheduling your session for *tomorrow at 10 AM CAT*, as my working hours for the day are over and it's already been a long day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
13/01/24, 9:59 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
13/01/24, 1:10 pm - Harmehak: I was expecting your response, so I would be scheduling your session for *Monday at 9:30 AM CAT*, as my working hours for the day are over and it's already been a long day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

15/01/24, 10:17 am - Harmehak: I can understand
15/01/24, 10:17 am - Harmehak: Do you have any queries for me?
15/01/24, 10:18 am - +263 78 120 2514: Right now everything is crystal clear

15/01/24, 1:56 pm - +263 78 120 2514: Thank you Ms. Harmehak
15/01/24, 1:57 pm - Harmehak: Anesu, Senior Academician Mr Piyush were in Zimbabwe for about 90 days, from his experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,

While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time. 

This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year. 

Wouldn't you agree to the same?
15/01/24, 2:02 pm - +263 78 120 2514: Yeah I do agree life in Zimbabwe is quite costly for both working people and even for students 
I do agree it is expensive
15/01/24, 2:04 pm - Harmehak: Very correct!

Now given the costs are less than those in Zimbabwe, are your parents willing to support your higher education in India financially, Anesu?
15/01/24, 2:05 pm - +263 78 120 2514: Financially they are willing to support me
15/01/24, 2:05 pm - Harmehak: Noted.
15/01/24, 2:05 pm - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!
15/01/24, 2:07 pm - +263 78 120 2514: I'm am confident that I will produce good results 3 Alevel passes to be specific
15/01/24, 2:19 pm - Harmehak: So, can you share your what motivates you to study Business Administration, Anesu?
15/01/24, 2:25 pm - +263 78 120 2514: I have always wanted to be a Doctor but as time went on I started having ideas of starting my own side business so I started selling sweets and different types of snacks at school and at home and it was very  successful until I realised that it's actually what I am good at since then I have always wanted to do something that is business related and I have a received a lot of motivation from my brothers who both persued paths that are rooted from commercial subjects
15/01/24, 2:38 pm - Harmehak: That's great and well put across, Anesu.

I am glad you thoroughly realised your interests and you have your siblings to guide you!

Now let me brief you about your desired course.
15/01/24, 2:39 pm - +263 78 120 2514: Okay I'm all ears

15/01/24, 3:29 pm - +263 78 120 2514: That is quite a reputation and I am convinced 💯 that it is quite one of the best education systems
15/01/24, 3:34 pm - Harmehak: I am glad this intrigued you and you found it helpful!

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
15/01/24, 3:45 pm - +263 78 120 2514: I have heard the costs and they are very high
15/01/24, 3:48 pm - Harmehak: I understand
15/01/24, 3:48 pm - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
15/01/24, 3:48 pm - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
15/01/24, 3:48 pm - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
15/01/24, 3:48 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
15/01/24, 3:50 pm - +263 78 120 2514: Ok ok I am following
15/01/24, 3:53 pm - Harmehak: In simple words Anesu, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
15/01/24, 3:53 pm - Harmehak: However as per my experience, I can share with you that *if you are able to perform and clear all these criteria with a high passing grade, you would be eligible for higher quantum of Scholarship*, in which you will just have to pay a minimal fee of *$1200-$1800*, Which would cover your entire fees be it food, accommodation, Tuition etc.
15/01/24, 3:53 pm - Harmehak: What are your thoughts on the same?
15/01/24, 3:55 pm - +263 78 120 2514: I think it is a great opportunity to be under the Edoofa Program
15/01/24, 4:05 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate please.
15/01/24, 4:06 pm - Harmehak: So now are you in a better position to relate how Edoofa is making higher education affordable and accessible for international students in India, Anesu?
15/01/24, 4:07 pm - +263 78 120 2514: I really understand now
15/01/24, 4:10 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

Now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program in detail and how it would assist you.
15/01/24, 4:10 pm - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
15/01/24, 4:10 pm - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
15/01/24, 4:10 pm - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

15/01/24, 4:10 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
15/01/24, 4:29 pm - Harmehak: Did you follow the same?
15/01/24, 4:34 pm - +263 78 120 2514: Yes I did thanks
15/01/24, 4:35 pm - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $1800 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$600 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $50-$60 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
15/01/24, 4:35 pm - Harmehak: Do ensure active participation, Anesu.
15/01/24, 4:45 pm - +263 78 120 2514: Ok ok I understand what you are saying
15/01/24, 4:55 pm - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

15/01/24, 5:06 pm - +263 78 120 2514: I have realized and I have learnt a lot about the Edoofa Program
15/01/24, 5:08 pm - Harmehak: That is great, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes. 

Are you ready?
15/01/24, 5:10 pm - +263 78 120 2514: Yes
15/01/24, 5:12 pm - Harmehak: Anesu, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
15/01/24, 5:12 pm - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
15/01/24, 5:14 pm - +263 78 120 2514: $1500 -   $2250
15/01/24, 5:15 pm - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
15/01/24, 5:15 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
15/01/24, 5:15 pm - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
15/01/24, 5:17 pm - +263 78 120 2514: Ok it is quite affordable
15/01/24, 5:17 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate
15/01/24, 5:17 pm - Harmehak: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
15/01/24, 5:18 pm - +263 78 120 2514: I think so too
15/01/24, 5:19 pm - Harmehak: That's amazing, so now that you have understood how Edoofa makes the application process affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
15/01/24, 5:19 pm - Harmehak: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

Phase 3: Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.
15/01/24, 5:19 pm - Harmehak: *However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
15/01/24, 5:22 pm - +263 78 120 2514: Ok I understand
15/01/24, 5:23 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
15/01/24, 5:23 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
15/01/24, 5:23 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle.
15/01/24, 5:23 pm - Harmehak: Step 5: After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities. 

August 2025 intake, applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from the Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 instalments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.
15/01/24, 5:23 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now, Anesu? <This message was edited>
15/01/24, 5:38 pm - +263 78 120 2514: I have understood properly
15/01/24, 5:39 pm - Harmehak: Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.
15/01/24, 5:39 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
15/01/24, 5:44 pm - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
15/01/24, 5:44 pm - Harmehak: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)
15/01/24, 5:44 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>

15/01/24, 7:30 pm - Harmehak: Sure please
15/01/24, 7:33 pm - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
15/01/24, 7:33 pm - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
15/01/24, 7:33 pm - Harmehak: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

16/01/24, 11:56 am - Harmehak: Did you happen to have a discussion with your parents, Anesu?

16/01/24, 12:03 pm - Harmehak: Can you please elaborate, Anesu?

16/01/24, 12:09 pm - Harmehak: While I completely understand the same, Anesu!

Do you believe the costs that you are offered here in India that is inclusive of Tuition fee, Accomodation and Food,

The same will ever be available in Zimbabwe for a student's higher education?
16/01/24, 12:13 pm - +263 78 120 2514: In Zimbabwe there are some universities that are currently charging $600  per semester
16/01/24, 12:14 pm - Harmehak: I believe you understand that this in the tuition fee only?

Which adds upto how much a year, Anesu?
16/01/24, 12:15 pm - +263 78 120 2514: $1200 per year without transport costs,food and accommodation
16/01/24, 12:17 pm - Harmehak: Very correct!

Now after adding up expenses like transport, food, Accomodation along with internet that's very expensive there!

16/01/24, 5:33 pm - Harmehak: Have you already had the opportunity to connect with Mrs. Ruth? 

You see, her story is truly remarkable. As a single parent, juggling the responsibilities of a small-scale farmer and the mother of two daughters, she has persevered. Her journey with Edoofa is a testament to how dedicated individuals can overcome obstacles.
Mrs. Ruth's experience with Edoofa is a testament to the transformative impact our programs can have. She not only managed her family's needs but also seized the opportunity for her daughters to achieve higher education. The support and guidance she received from Edoofa were instrumental in her success.
The process was challenging, yet incredibly rewarding. Mrs. Ruth's determination, combined with Edoofa's assistance, has paved the way for a brighter future.
16/01/24, 5:36 pm - +263 77 338 5309: Not yet but l will try to connect with her tomorrow
16/01/24, 5:36 pm - Harmehak: Surely,

I shall appreciate if Mrs Kachomba and Anesu can connect as well!
