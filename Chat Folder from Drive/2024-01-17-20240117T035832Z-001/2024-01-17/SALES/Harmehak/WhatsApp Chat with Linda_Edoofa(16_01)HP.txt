What did you learn about the Edoofa Program after interacting with a student beneficiary of the Edoofa Scholarship?

I heard that edoofa is a scholarship program that offers from 50-100 percent scholarships to African students to study at prestigious universities in India. It also provides an opportunity for one  to work and learn at the same time. The money is earned in form of scholarship credits that can be deducted from your annual fee after the scholarship. It also provides webinars that makes one skilled for jobs and other. It also helps you get to know more internship opportunities. 


Why should you be accepted into the Edoofa Program (20-40 Words)?

Because I am a dedicated learner  and I am very passionate about learning new skills and languages that can  open new opportunities in my lfe.
