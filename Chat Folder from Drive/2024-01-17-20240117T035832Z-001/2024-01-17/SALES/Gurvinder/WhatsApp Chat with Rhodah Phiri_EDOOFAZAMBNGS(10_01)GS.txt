I am Mr Gurvinder Singh, Senior Career Counselor at Edoofa

Welcome to the Edoofa Scholarship Counselling Session

Before we begin with the session, I would like to ask you, what prior understanding you have about the Edoofa Scholarship Program
10/01/24, 11:20 am - +260 97 2873802: I think it's program that offers great opportunities to the scholars that want to pursue it
10/01/24, 11:24 am - +260 97 2873802: It provides both accessible and affordable services to learners such as providing them with some of the best internship opportunities which may also lead to job opportunities
10/01/24, 11:43 am - Gurvinder: That is correct, let me brief you more.
10/01/24, 11:44 am - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
10/01/24, 11:44 am - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
10/01/24, 11:44 am - Gurvinder: EDOOFA has commended the new government for its dedicated efforts and positive changes in the education sector, including the elimination of school fees, an increase in the number of teachers, and a focus on protecting vulnerable learners, particularly adolescent girls. *Edoofa is proud to support the government in its mission to transform the education sector and achieve sustainable development, aimed at ensuring quality education that is inclusive and equitable for all by 2030.*
10/01/24, 11:44 am - Gurvinder: With the influx of students from Zimbabwe, we recorded more than 1500 students to the program in each of the last two years. Having a strong network and grasp of more than 100 schools with a panel of Headmasters, teachers, parents, and other educators, we now look to replicate our success in Zambia as well where we have already begun enrolling students since the last 6 months and we have closed 2023 intake with over 1500 students.

10/01/24, 11:44 am - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
10/01/24, 12:12 pm - +260 97 2873802: How much scholarship can I get? and how much do I pay?
10/01/24, 12:18 pm - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
10/01/24, 12:20 pm - +260 97 2873802: Yes but can one also seek employment in India
10/01/24, 12:28 pm - Gurvinder: Please, let us be patient as this a counselling session, I will address your every concern ahead.
10/01/24, 12:30 pm - +260 97 2873802: Okay
10/01/24, 12:31 pm - +260 97 2873802: Thank you
10/01/24, 12:36 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so Rhodah, as we start your counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
10/01/24, 12:37 pm - +260 97 2873802: Yes, I do
10/01/24, 12:39 pm - +260 97 2873802: Though am separated from my parents
10/01/24, 12:42 pm - Gurvinder: Now Rhodah, I would like to know you better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about yourself, your career aspiration do include sharing about:-

*“Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world.”*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
12/01/24, 10:45 am - +260 97 2873802: Yes
12/01/24, 11:52 am - Gurvinder: Since you have understood the course properly can you now tell me in 150 to 200 words that if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself 5 years after the completion of this course and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
12/01/24, 12:47 pm - +260 97 2873802: With the Edoofa's Program by my side and a little bit of extra work I believe I would have a lot of ample job opportunities with the knowledge acquired, I believe I would seek employment from a top notch hospital, clinic or rehabilitation center. After five years I see my self being a real life superhero with skills help patience live longer and healthy lives as well as making close bonds with team mates and patients which I feel is a major benefit. I see myself being one of the best cardiovascular technologist being able to conduct tests on pulmonary or cardiovascular systems of patients for diagnostic  
purposes. Am going to aim higher and further with my studies. I see myself being able to work full time schedules in hospital working fairly during week ends and nights getting familiar to patients by engaging them in small talk and other things which is quite enjoyable
12/01/24, 12:57 pm - +260 97 2873802: I believe I will be satisfied with the line of work I have chosen and I would work hard sense it requires critical thinking quality.
12/01/24, 1:14 pm - Gurvinder: That is really great Rhodah I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations,

However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

Are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way inorder to transform your career dear?
12/01/24, 1:17 pm - +260 97 2873802: Yes, even more than that because I feel over joyed and really interested to know even more about it
12/01/24, 1:32 pm - +260 97 2873802: Thank you for admirations
12/01/24, 1:53 pm - Gurvinder: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
12/01/24, 4:42 pm - +260 97 2873802: Because studying abroad gives me the opportunity to see the world from a different aspect experiencing a brand new country with incredible outlooks, customs and activities. It also gives me a chance to experience different styles of education which may not have been exposed in my own country. I also believe it can also be a way for me to understand and appreciate county's history and people, perhaps even granting me an chance to immerse myself in a new language. It would be easier for me to find employment because I would have gotten used to the unfamiliar environment by meeting new life long friends from different backgrounds
13/01/24, 7:53 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

*“You don't have to be great to start, but you have to start to be great."*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
13/01/24, 10:05 am - +260 97 2873802: Okay
13/01/24, 10:27 am - Gurvinder: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
13/01/24, 11:18 am - +260 97 2873802: Upon returning to my home country, I can share some of the new found knowledge and skills that I have learnt contributing to various sectors which in my case is health. Studying abroad will give a broader perspective on global issues such as climate change and health care as student who has studied abroad I would be able to bring back innovative ideas and approaches to tackle these issues. The values obtained can facilitate collaboration and improve intercultural relations which will also lead to transferring advanced technologies. The other way is by starting education programs, work shops or mentorship initiatives to share the knowledge and skills that I have acquired abroad
13/01/24, 11:41 am - Gurvinder: I appreciate your sense of hardworking for your community Rhodah, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?
13/01/24, 11:43 am - +260 97 2873802: Yes, I do
13/01/24, 12:07 pm - Gurvinder: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
13/01/24, 12:09 pm - +260 97 2873802: Yes, I have
13/01/24, 12:21 pm - Gurvinder: You see Edoofa’s vision to provide every student with an education that is not just affordable but accessible and employable as well can only be achieved by utilizing the infrastructure of Indian Education landscape that has been developed over the last 75+ years since India’s Independence.

13/01/24, 12:51 pm - +260 97 2873802: Okay, thank you. I will
15/01/24, 8:38 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

*“Set your goals high, and don’t stop till you get there.”*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
15/01/24, 9:18 am - +260 97 2873802: Okay
15/01/24, 9:48 am - Gurvinder: So now Rhodah, I hope you must have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead. As of now would you like to ask anything so far?
15/01/24, 9:54 am - +260 97 2873802: No
15/01/24, 10:10 am - Gurvinder: So now moving ahead by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India?
15/01/24, 10:11 am - +260 97 2873802: No, I don't think so
15/01/24, 10:26 am - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
15/01/24, 10:26 am - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
15/01/24, 10:26 am - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
15/01/24, 10:26 am - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
15/01/24, 10:26 am - Gurvinder: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*

*after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
15/01/24, 11:04 am - +260 97 2873802: Can you please tell me more about the Earn While You Learn Program
15/01/24, 11:08 am - Gurvinder: Rhodah, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
15/01/24, 11:10 am - +260 97 2873802: Thank you
15/01/24, 11:10 am - Gurvinder: The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

*1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-_*Africa Global Radio*_ - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

-_*Skooqs*_ - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
15/01/24, 11:10 am - Gurvinder: *2. Recruitment Partners: -*

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
15/01/24, 11:10 am - Gurvinder: *3. Webinars: -*

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
_Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world_ by *Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade*.

15/01/24, 11:11 am - Gurvinder: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase. 

*What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
15/01/24, 11:21 am - +260 97 2873802: Yes,  I do think I do think it will benefit me. After hearing and the gratitude and expressions of various edoofians about the program. It shows how positive the impact of the program is especially on Africans knowing our current position
15/01/24, 11:22 am - Gurvinder: I am delighted to hear that Rhodah, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
15/01/24, 11:27 am - +260 97 2873802: Thank you, am actually overwhelmed to hear that
15/01/24, 11:28 am - Gurvinder: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

15/01/24, 11:28 am - Gurvinder: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
15/01/24, 11:35 am - +260 97 2873802: Indeed it is, without me even realizing it
15/01/24, 11:49 am - +260 97 2873802: Because it is really affordable but only with a lot of hard work put in it
15/01/24, 11:56 am - Gurvinder: Alright Rhodah, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
15/01/24, 11:57 am - +260 97 2873802: Yes
15/01/24, 11:57 am - Gurvinder: Okay so may I know if you have discussed international education plans with them in depth?
15/01/24, 11:59 am - +260 97 2873802: Not that much but for my sake they are willing to do anything
15/01/24, 11:59 am - Gurvinder: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
15/01/24, 12:00 pm - +260 97 2873802: Yes
15/01/24, 12:00 pm - Gurvinder: Rhodah as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
15/01/24, 12:03 pm - +260 97 2873802: $1,500-$2,250
15/01/24, 12:10 pm - +260 97 2873802: Which is close to a edoofa scholarship  tuition fees and what can be earned within a year and some months of the Earn While You Learn Program
15/01/24, 12:37 pm - Gurvinder: Exactly Rhodah, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
15/01/24, 12:37 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
15/01/24, 12:53 pm - +260 97 2873802: Okay
15/01/24, 12:53 pm - Gurvinder: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
15/01/24, 12:56 pm - +260 97 2873802: Yes, I do
15/01/24, 12:59 pm - Gurvinder: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
15/01/24, 12:59 pm - Gurvinder: Basically, there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee, before their Grade 12 result is out).


Phase 3: Once the final grade 12 results are out, if the student would have passed the necessary requirement (of 4 Grade 12 passes.) then start with their University Interaction. If the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents.


The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.

However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
15/01/24, 1:05 pm - +260 97 2873802: Thank you
15/01/24, 1:07 pm - Gurvinder: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.

Are you familiar with the Edoofa Cycle?
15/01/24, 1:07 pm - +260 97 2873802: Not really
15/01/24, 1:09 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
15/01/24, 1:09 pm - Gurvinder: Alright Rhodah, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. <This message was edited>
15/01/24, 1:09 pm - Gurvinder: Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zambia itself.
15/01/24, 1:09 pm - Gurvinder: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
15/01/24, 1:13 pm - +260 97 2873802: Yes, I do
15/01/24, 1:17 pm - Gurvinder: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of the registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
15/01/24, 1:17 pm - Gurvinder: Basically, this registration fee will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August/September 2024 and the remaining in January next year 2025.
15/01/24, 1:17 pm - Gurvinder: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
15/01/24, 1:17 pm - Gurvinder: So now would you like to ask anything?
15/01/24, 1:22 pm - +260 97 2873802: At what amount are the installments
15/01/24, 1:33 pm - Gurvinder: Please the instalment amount will be set by the University.
15/01/24, 1:33 pm - +260 97 2873802: Okay, thank you for the information
15/01/24, 1:33 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check
15/01/24, 1:33 pm - Gurvinder: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
15/01/24, 1:34 pm - Gurvinder: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

16/01/24, 2:00 pm - +260 96 4697017: This is not a scholarship where you have to pay for the student then the child pays when they start working?
