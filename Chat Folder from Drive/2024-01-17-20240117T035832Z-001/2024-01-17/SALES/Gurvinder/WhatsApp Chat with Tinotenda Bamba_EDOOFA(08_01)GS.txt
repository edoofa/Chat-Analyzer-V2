10/01/24, 10:38 am - +263 71 572 9765: I haven't learnt anything about Tatenda's journey and experience with the Edoofa Program yet but according to what he shared with us Edoofa schoolarship program believes in quality education and also it believes that everyone should get a chance to a quality educational experience 
The Edoofa Program is based with work- study models , This program also offers or helps in solving the problem of lack of affordable hight education and also employment
10/01/24, 10:43 am - +263 71 572 9765: The Edoofa Program also stays with students throughout their academic process as their mentor and a caretaker , this program help the students from building applications , applying to college and also training them
10/01/24, 10:53 am - +263 71 572 9765: The program is well-appreciated in African Continents as it offers 50-100% tuition fees and this program has helped over 3000 students  from different countries with affordable , accessible education and also employible driven
10/01/24, 11:31 am - Gurvinder: Noted, let me brief you more.
10/01/24, 11:31 am - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
10/01/24, 11:31 am - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
10/01/24, 11:31 am - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
10/01/24, 11:32 am - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
10/01/24, 11:49 am - +263 71 572 9765: Yes that right sir
10/01/24, 11:50 am - +263 71 572 9765: Thank you for explaining further it's more clearer now
10/01/24, 11:50 am - +263 71 572 9765: Excuse me Mr Gurvinder l might have some questions to ask you so that l understand better
10/01/24, 12:07 pm - Gurvinder: Please share your concerns?
10/01/24, 3:14 pm - +263 71 572 9765: Can you in lighten on how your system works in term of the schoolarship
10/01/24, 3:51 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so Tinotenda, as we start your counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
10/01/24, 9:17 pm - Gurvinder: Well Dear, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you tomorrow again at 10AM CAT to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care.

Have a good day ahead. 
God Bless You!
10/01/24, 9:50 pm - +263 71 572 9765: Thank you so much sir
11/01/24, 8:47 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

13/01/24, 9:59 am - +263 71 572 9765: Why I choose Marketing:
I believe its a theory of human motivation that can be used to develop new products, focus promotional strategies, segment markets, and overall communicate better with consumers while creating an environment conducive for brand engagement to take place.
However studying Marketing gives a unique competitive advantage for me: 
i.e You can learn how to promote yourself and your work. After all, marketing helps in understand the true meaning of value: The value of the product and the value of the person or brand that delivers said product.
13/01/24, 10:17 am - Gurvinder: Tinotenda, your insights into marketing are insightful and demonstrate a clear understanding of the field's significance. Recognizing marketing as a tool for understanding human motivation, developing products, and creating effective communication strategies is a key aspect of success in this field.
13/01/24, 10:17 am - Gurvinder: So if I may ask from your family or known circle has anyone pursued a career in this field?
13/01/24, 12:13 pm - +263 71 572 9765: Noone in my family has pursued in this field nor my known circle Sir

15/01/24, 10:53 am - Gurvinder: After understanding your interests and motivation toward the Subject
According to my expertise, the following course will cater to all your likings and will help you achieve your future goals:

*Bachelor of Commerce (B.com)*
15/01/24, 12:17 pm - +263 71 572 9765: Can you please explain further about this course
15/01/24, 12:47 pm - Gurvinder: Yes I will, but first I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.
15/01/24, 12:47 pm - Gurvinder: Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.
15/01/24, 1:20 pm - +263 77 230 2349: Ok we understand but whats the way forward
15/01/24, 1:20 pm - +263 77 230 2349: So now what are the requirement
15/01/24, 1:27 pm - Gurvinder: So shall I brief you about the course?
15/01/24, 1:43 pm - +263 77 230 2349: Yes sir thank
15/01/24, 1:49 pm - Gurvinder: *Bachelor of Commerce (B.com)* is a three year long undergraduate course that is evenly distributed into 6 half-yearly semesters.

15/01/24, 2:28 pm - Gurvinder: Since you have understood the course properly can you now tell me in 150 to 200 words that if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself 5 years after the completion of this course and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
15/01/24, 6:32 pm - +263 71 572 9765: A Bachelor of Commerce degree opens up a vast array of career opportunities across multiple industries, such as accounting, finance, marketing, and management. It will provide me with a wide range of business skills to have a strong understanding and appreciation of business. By studying different aspects of business, I will be able to work more seamlessly with other professionals in the future, equipping me with the knowledge and skills needed to excel in various roles, and making them marketable to employers. 
So I Tinotenda Bamba. As I hold a Degree in bachelor of commerce, 5 years later do see myself as a community builder. Yes, I do have benefits of my interest but also do not forget my community. The reason is that commerce plays a significant role in the day-to-day running of businesses and, the development of nations and their citizens by simply facilitating trade between nations or within the nation so this allows me to study harder on the degree for my loved ones and me, I thank you.

16/01/24, 10:48 am - +263 77 416 8524: - Universities are very expensive here 
- she stands to gain quite a great deal of exposure outside of the country
16/01/24, 10:50 am - +263 77 230 2349: Name: ‎Tino Buddie‎
Phone1: ‎‎0782559997‎‎

She is a hard working girl
16/01/24, 12:31 pm - Gurvinder: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
16/01/24, 12:41 pm - +263 71 572 9765: Currently  with the economy  in our country  it is very expensive  to study in my county  
Also studying  abroad  will open new opportunities  for me in terms of employment  because  according  to my research  students that obtained  their degrees  abroad have a huge opportunity  to find employment  in our country  
Last but not least the reason  why l want to study  abroad  is because  l want experience  and exposure
16/01/24, 12:58 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
16/01/24, 2:16 pm - +263 71 572 9765: If that happens  then l will  try to share my experience  with my pears
16/01/24, 2:19 pm - Gurvinder: I appreciate your sense of hardworking for your community Tinotenda, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?
16/01/24, 2:20 pm - +263 71 572 9765: Yes l will  be able
16/01/24, 2:23 pm - Gurvinder: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
16/01/24, 2:24 pm - +263 71 572 9765: Yes l wanted to ask that question  stating  why India  from all the countries
16/01/24, 2:27 pm - Gurvinder: You see Edoofa’s vision to provide every student with an education that is not just affordable but accessible and employable as well can only be achieved by utilizing the infrastructure of Indian Education landscape that has been developed over the last 75+ years since India’s Independence.
