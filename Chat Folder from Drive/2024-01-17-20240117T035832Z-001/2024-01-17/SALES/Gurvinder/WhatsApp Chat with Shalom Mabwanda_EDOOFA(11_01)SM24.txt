I am *Mr. Shubham*, The Senior Acadmecian at Edoofa. We also have with us *Mr. Jyotishman, Head Admissions Officer* 


We have received your application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Which was recommended to us by your friend *Thrive*, I hope I have contacted the right person.

I would like you to come online so that I could discuss with you the application form which you submitted and what I was able to understand from the same! <This message was edited>

11/01/24, 11:59 am - +263 78 039 0856: Hie
11/01/24, 1:12 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Hello Shalom. How are you?
11/01/24, 2:13 pm - +263 78 039 0856: Am fine and you
11/01/24, 2:18 pm - Shubham Madhwal: I am doing rgeat please
11/01/24, 2:18 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Welcome to the session, It is good to see that you have taken the time to learn about the program and fill out the application form. Can you please tell me:
*1)  What motivated you to apply for the Edoofa Scholarship program?*
*2) What is your understanding of the program as per your discussions with Thrive?*
11/01/24, 4:01 pm - +263 78 039 0856: 1-It has always been my dream to study abroad especially in India because it gives the opportunity to pursue my passion as the scholarship encourages students to explore their interests
It also motivated me to apply for the scholarship program because it provides financial assistance to students who are interested in pursuing tetiary education
The edoofa scholarship program's goal to increase access to higher education motivated me especially for students from underrepresented groups
The sense of community and support that comes with being part of the scholarship program also motivated me to apply for the program
India is a diverse and culturally rich country and there is the experience of variety of cultures and traditions and this also motivated me to apply for the scholarship program




2-Thrive made the discussion easy to understand therefore l understood that the scholarship program provides assistance in financial situation for example the fee hikes of universities in Zimbabwe has made some students to delay pursuing their dreams by looking for money to go to university unlike the scholarship program in India that gives an opportunity to study and pursue thier dreams
I also understood that there is room for opportunities of being employed after graduating in India
Thrive also made it clear that studying in India is affordable
The earn while you learn is helpful by giving the students a chance to even support the family during the course 
Studying in India makes students to receive a world class education at a fraction of the cost of studying in other countries
11/01/24, 4:05 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Duly Noted, 
I can see that you have a partial understanding of the Edoofa Program, during the course of the session ahead, I will help you and your parents to understand the program and the process to get enrolled for the scholarship in detail

12/01/24, 9:33 am - Shubham Madhwal: Good Morning Everyone, 

*"The greatest glory in living lies not in never falling, but in rising every time we fall."*

With all positive energy, I am here to continue our interactive session.

12/01/24, 10:43 am - Shubham Madhwal: So let me further elaborate to you on the Edoofa Scholarship Program
Edoofa Scholarship Program is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4500 students from different countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability is driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains! <This message was edited>
12/01/24, 10:43 am - Shubham Madhwal: You know we have been helping students from the African nations and the SAARC countries for the past 6 years and in the short span of 6 years, the most common feedback which we hear from the students is how the Edoofa Program makes the higher education affordable through the financial aid and how it helps the students to make a financial plan to make sure that their dream of higher education abroad is fulfilled.

Basically, our motive is that by providing the SEELS (Students of Edoofa Earning and Learning to Success) initiative, we help our students in Planning and Giving them opportunities through which they can help themselves by self-sponsoring their higher education at the least annual Fee Possible.
12/01/24, 10:58 am - +263 78 039 0856: Ohh okay l understand

12/01/24, 3:46 pm - Shubham Madhwal: It is indeed a pleasure to be connected with you, *Mr Mabwanda*, so I hope you know that the Edoofa Program makes higher education affordable through financial aid and how it helps the students make a financial plan to ensure their dream of higher education abroad is fulfilled.

16/01/24, 8:15 am - +263 78 039 0856: Okay my current school is not really one of the best schools in the country. The school doesn't really provide us with textbooks so l have to go an extra mile alone when finishing an assignment or even reading and this helps me in getting good marks in my academics .The best thing l like about my school is that there is a lot of time for study .We go to church almost every Sunday and the preachings we get are really helpful in becoming a better person and knowing God better and not forgetting to work hard as the Lord helps those who help themselves
