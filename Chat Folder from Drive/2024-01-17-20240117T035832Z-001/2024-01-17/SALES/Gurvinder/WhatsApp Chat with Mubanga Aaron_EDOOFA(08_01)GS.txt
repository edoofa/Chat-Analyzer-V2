*I am Mr Gurvinder Singh, Senior Career Counselor at Edoofa*

We have received an application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program from your friend and our student.

I hope I have contacted the right person.

I would like you to come online so that I could discuss with you the form you submitted online and what I was able to understand from the same!
08/01/24, 10:44 am - +260 772287526: Good morning sir,
You have contacted the right person. I am  online and ready to discuss the scholarship.

Your positive response will be highly appreciated.
08/01/24, 10:48 am - Gurvinder: It is a pleasure to connect with you today Aaron,

You can address me as Mr Gurvinder, we do have Mr Shubham, Senior Academician and  Mr Jyotishman, Head of Admissions who will be evaluating your responses for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
08/01/24, 10:50 am - +260 772287526: Thank you very much Mr.Gurvinder, this will be a great opportunity for me to further  my studies. I’m kindly asking if you may assist me with the requirements for the scholarship.
08/01/24, 10:59 am - Gurvinder: Alright, so Aaron, I can see you got to know about the Edoofa Program from Kooji, is that correct?
08/01/24, 11:02 am - +260 772287526: Yes Mr. Gurvinder, I got to know the program from Kooji.
08/01/24, 11:05 am - Gurvinder: Okay, so can you tell me what all did you learn about the Edoofa Program from Kooji, also do tell me whether you learnt about Kooji’s Journey and Experience with the Edoofa Program?
08/01/24, 11:57 am - +260 772287526: So I heard about the Edoofa from Kooji and he told me that it is a program that believes that education is for everyone and so they offer scholarships to those who seek higher education abroad  to receive the best education in another country.
08/01/24, 11:57 am - +260 772287526: And he says his journey with Edoofa has been long but they have taught Him a lot about Edoofa and what it takes to make it in the professional workplace  and that the opportunity is a life changing one
08/01/24, 12:03 pm - Gurvinder: That is correct, let me brief you more.
08/01/24, 12:03 pm - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
08/01/24, 12:03 pm - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
08/01/24, 12:03 pm - Gurvinder: EDOOFA has commended the new government for its dedicated efforts and positive changes in the education sector, including the elimination of school fees, an increase in the number of teachers, and a focus on protecting vulnerable learners, particularly adolescent girls. *Edoofa is proud to support the government in its mission to transform the education sector and achieve sustainable development, aimed at ensuring quality education that is inclusive and equitable for all by 2030.*
08/01/24, 12:03 pm - Gurvinder: With the influx of students from Zimbabwe, we recorded more than 1500 students to the program in each of the last two years. Having a strong network and grasp of more than 100 schools with a panel of Headmasters, teachers, parents, and other educators, we now look to replicate our success in Zambia as well where we have already begun enrolling students since the last 6 months and we have closed 2023 intake with over 1500 students.
08/01/24, 12:03 pm - Gurvinder: *Our strong relationships with educational institutions, such as Penmal Connect Ltd. and Trident College in Zambia, have led to numerous successful outcomes and partnerships with schools including Kamulanga High, Canisius Secondary, Sanjongo Secondary, The Copperbelt University, Chavuma Boarding Secondary, Mutanda Boarding Secondary, Chimwemwe Secondary, National Hillcrest, Matero Boys Secondary, and others. We are also connected with institutions like Njase, Ndola Girls, Fatima Secondary, Torbit, and Zambezi Boarding among others, to provide, expand and build upon the opportunities of the Edoofa Scholarship Program for deserving students throughout Zambia*

10/01/24, 9:23 pm - Gurvinder: Hi Dear, I hope you are doing well.

I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons that I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship. 

I hope to get a positive response from you soon.
11/01/24, 8:48 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

*“Strive not to be a success, but rather to be of value”*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
11/01/24, 8:54 am - +260 772287526: Good morning Mr.Gurvinder.

We may discuss the scholarship further today. I would love to know the requirements for me to be accepted.
11/01/24, 9:06 am - Gurvinder: May I know, why have you been so inactive? <This message was edited>
11/01/24, 9:13 am - +260 772287526: I work part time and it required much of my attention hence I haven’t been active, I’m really sorry and I promise that it won’t happen again going forward.
11/01/24, 9:32 am - Gurvinder: Noted.
11/01/24, 9:33 am - Gurvinder: Please address this.
11/01/24, 9:35 am - +260 772287526: Yes sir this is exactly what I need. 

I am looking for an opportunity to further my education and become a useful person in society. I believe this program may enable my dreams turn into reality
11/01/24, 9:57 am - Gurvinder: Okay so Aaron, as we start your counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
11/01/24, 10:02 am - +260 772287526: Noted.

I believe I have the qualities that will enable me to get a scholarship. I have good leadership skills of which I served as vice head boy for two consecutive years at my previous school, holly cross convent school. My athletic ability is good and my academic performance is consistent.
11/01/24, 10:11 am - Gurvinder: Now Aaron, I would like to know you better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about yourself, your career aspiration do include sharing about:-

1. Your highest education level?
2. The course you would like to study?
3. What do your parents do?
4. What is your parent’s highest education level?
5. Who has been supporting you for your Education so far?
6. Who will be supporting you financially for your higher education abroad?
7. Do you have any siblings? if yes, what do they do?
8. May I know which school do you study at and in which province is it located along with that how much was your per-term fee in Grade 12?

Please elaborate on your answers and answer them in points, so that I can understand your application more briefly and assist you in a better way
11/01/24, 10:38 am - +260 772287526: • I completed my grade 12 last year at holly cross convent school.

I tried to summarize everything, you may ask where I wasn’t clear I shed more light on it.
11/01/24, 11:36 am - Gurvinder: It is a pleasure to know you Aaron.
11/01/24, 11:36 am - Gurvinder: So now as we proceed ahead, I have a question, during your introduction you mentioned you would like to study mechanical engineering, could you please share what motivates you behind this field of study?
11/01/24, 12:18 pm - +260 772287526: Mechanical engineering has been my dream since I was a child, this is because I have always wanted to make inventions that would change the world and make it a better place. Growing up my father always had challenges with his car hence he was fixing it a lot. Therefore I want to come up with better engines that won’t be perfect but close to perfect.
11/01/24, 1:18 pm - Gurvinder: Aaron, your passion for mechanical engineering is truly inspiring. It's wonderful to hear that this field has been your dream since childhood, and your desire to make inventions that can positively impact the world is commendable.
11/01/24, 1:19 pm - Gurvinder: So if I may ask from your family or known circle has anyone pursued a career in this field?
11/01/24, 1:26 pm - +260 772287526: My elder brother who is the third born has succeeded in the mechanical engineering field. He sends me books to study in order for me  to have a broader understanding therefore it will be a walk over when I am into university.
11/01/24, 1:40 pm - +260 97 5116471: I too can say mechanical engineering has been Aaron’s dream since childhood. He would usually come up with small inventions and when it works perfectly the smile he wore on his face you could tell those were one of he’s happiest moments. I believe with hard work, discipline and guidance he will achieve his dream, and this platform may be one of the best opportunities for us.
11/01/24, 1:55 pm - Gurvinder: That is great.
11/01/24, 1:55 pm - Gurvinder: Alright so now can you share your Grade 10 and Grade 12 results for evaluation?
11/01/24, 2:06 pm - +260 772287526: Unfortunately I have only managed to retrieve my grade 10 results. I will have to visit my previous school tomorrow morning for grade 11 and 12 results.

11/01/24, 3:35 pm - Gurvinder: After understanding your interests and motivation toward the Subject
According to my expertise, the following course will cater to all your likings and will help you achieve your future goals:

*B.Tech. Mechanical Engineering*
11/01/24, 4:04 pm - +260 772287526: Kindly shed more light on B. Tech.Mechanical Engineering
11/01/24, 4:12 pm - Gurvinder: *B.Tech. Mechanical Engineering* is a 4-year undergraduate course

First thing any engineering aspirant considers while choosing a branch in Engineering is placement aspect and the course very well caters to it. A few questions which arise when admissions to engineering colleges commence include the branch in demand, highest paid engineering graduates and others such.  Apart from this palcement criteria, there are some other parameters which should be considered while choosing a discipline like- what are the research opportunities, what is scope of career growth etc.

Mechanical Engineering is the evergreen branch of engineering. Market scenario and demand of engineering graduates change every year but the demand of mechanical engineering degree will never be obsolete. Mechanical engineering graduates can find placements in almost every sector, right from construction sector to steel industry and from automobile to software.

Following are the sub disciplines that are associated with mechanical engineering:

*Production Engineering*
*Industrial Engineering*
*Manufacturing Engineering*
*Automobile Engineering*
*Artificial Intelligence*

The field of mechanical engineering can be thought of as a collection of many mechanical engineering science disciplines. Several of these subdisciplines which are typically taught at the undergraduate level are listed below, with a brief explanation and the most common application of each. Some of these subdisciplines are unique to mechanical engineering, while others are a combination of mechanical engineering and one or more other disciplines. Most work that a mechanical engineer does uses skills and techniques from several of these subdisciplines, as well as specialized subdisciplines. Specialized subdisciplines, as used in this article, are more likely to be the subject of graduate studies or on-the-job training than undergraduate research. Several specialized sub disciplines are discussed in this section.

*Mechanics* 

Mechanics is, in the most general sense, the study of forces and their effect upon matter. Typically, engineering mechanics is used to analyze and predict the acceleration and deformation (both elastic and plastic) of objects under known forces (also called loads) or stresses. Subdisciplines of mechanics include Statics, the study of non-moving bodies under known loads, how forces affect static bodies Dynamics the study of how forces affect moving bodies. Dynamics includes kinematics (about movement, velocity, and acceleration) and kinetics (about forces and resulting accelerations). Mechanics of materials, the study of how different materials deform under various types of stress Fluid mechanics, the study of how fluids react to forces Kinematics, the study of the motion of bodies (objects) and systems (groups of objects), while ignoring the forces that cause the motion. Kinematics is often used in the design and analysis of mechanisms. Continuum mechanics, a method of applying mechanics that assumes that objects are continuous (rather than discrete) Mechanical engineers typically use mechanics in the design or analysis phases of engineering. If the engineering project were the design of a vehicle, statics might be employed to design the frame of the vehicle, in order to evaluate where the stresses will be most intense. Dynamics might be used when designing the car's engine, to evaluate the forces in the pistons and cams as the engine cycles. Mechanics of materials might be used to choose appropriate materials for the frame and engine. Fluid mechanics might be used to design a ventilation system for the vehicle (see HVAC), or to design the intake system for the engine

*Mechatronics and Robotics*

Mechatronics is a combination of mechanics and electronics. It is an interdisciplinary branch of mechanical engineering, electrical engineering and software engineering that is concerned with integrating electrical and mechanical engineering to create hybrid systems. In this way, machines can be automated through the use of electric motors, servo-mechanisms, and other electrical systems in conjunction with special software. A common example of a mechatronics system is a CD-ROM drive. Mechanical systems open and close the drive, spin the CD and move the laser, while an optical system reads the data on the CD and converts it to bits. Integrated software controls the process and communicates the contents of the CD to the computer.

Robotics is the application of mechatronics to create robots, which are often used in industry to perform tasks that are dangerous, unpleasant, or repetitive. These robots may be of any shape and size, but all are preprogrammed and interact physically with the world. To create a robot, an engineer typically employs kinematics (to determine the robot's range of motion) and mechanics (to determine the stresses within the robot).

Robots are used extensively in industrial engineering. They allow businesses to save money on labor, perform tasks that are either too dangerous or too precise for humans to perform them economically, and to ensure better quality. Many companies employ assembly lines of robots, especially in Automotive Industries and some factories are so robotized that they can run by themselves. Outside the factory, robots have been employed in bomb disposal, space exploration, and many other fields. Robots are also sold for various residential applications, from recreation to domestic applications.

*Thermodynamics and Thermo-science*

Thermodynamics is an applied science used in several branches of engineering, including mechanical and chemical engineering. At its simplest, thermodynamics is the study of energy, its use and transformation through a system. Typically, engineering thermodynamics is concerned with changing energy from one form to another. As an example, automotive engines convert chemical energy (enthalpy) from the fuel into heat, and then into mechanical work that eventually turns the wheels.

Thermodynamics principles are used by mechanical engineers in the fields of heat transfer, thermofluids, and energy conversion. Mechanical engineers use thermo-science to design engines and power plants, heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems, heat exchangers, heat sinks, radiators, refrigeration, insulation, and others.

*Design and drafting*

Drafting or technical drawing is the means by which mechanical engineers design products and create instructions for manufacturing parts. A technical drawing can be a computer model or hand-drawn schematic showing all the dimensions necessary to manufacture a part, as well as assembly notes, a list of required materials, and other pertinent information. A U.S. mechanical engineer or skilled worker who creates technical drawings may be referred to as a drafter or draftsman. Drafting has historically been a two-dimensional process, but computer-aided design (CAD) programs now allow the designer to create in three dimensions.

Instructions for manufacturing a part must be fed to the necessary machinery, either manually, through programmed instructions, or through the use of a computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) or combined CAD/CAM program. Optionally, an engineer may also manually manufacture a part using the technical drawings. However, with the advent of computer numerically controlled (CNC) manufacturing, parts can now be fabricated without the need for constant technician input. Manually manufactured parts generally consist of spray coatings, surface finishes, and other processes that cannot economically or practically be done by a machine.

Drafting is used in nearly every subdiscipline of mechanical engineering, and by many other branches of engineering and architecture. Three-dimensional models created using CAD software are also commonly used in finite element analysis (FEA) and computational fluid dynamics (CFD).

12/01/24, 2:15 pm - +260 772287526: Engineering has been something I have been interested in since I was young. The thought of designing things is something I would very much like. Given the right path I see my self owing my own company in five years. I want my designs to be used around the world. I don't want to work for someone else, I want to people to work for me .I want to use my skills to create something that has never been done before that would benefit the lives of many people. My contribution to the world through engineering should be something that will help as many people as possible and something that will be remembered for many years to come. Not only this but I want to be an engineer that people will look up to, someone that inspires children every where and let's them know that your dreams are possible if you are willing to put in the hard work to get there.
12/01/24, 2:37 pm - Gurvinder: That is really great Aaron I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations,

However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

Are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way inorder to transform your career dear?

13/01/24, 7:48 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

*“You don't have to be great to start, but you have to start to be great."*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
13/01/24, 8:06 am - +260 772287526: Good morning Mr. Gurvinder
13/01/24, 8:28 am - Gurvinder: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
13/01/24, 8:54 am - +260 772287526: Studying abroad will give me a wider understanding on not only engineering but another country’s culture. That way it will open up my interaction skills hence I can easily interact with others in work places. I also believe that it will Enhance my Academic Experience, Career Advancement and exposure to new opportunities and languages.
13/01/24, 9:13 am - Gurvinder: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
13/01/24, 9:29 am - +260 772287526: Well as since Aspire to be an engineer, I can use my knowledge and skills in this line if work to improve the infrastructure of schools in my country. This would ensure that students would have a clean and safe environment to learn . This would also ensure that they receive the education in infrastructures that are suited to their learning needs. In turn this would creat citizens that are aware and educated properly who can further promote development in the country.
13/01/24, 9:46 am - Gurvinder: I appreciate your sense of hardworking for your community Aaron, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?
13/01/24, 9:58 am - +260 772287526: I totally agree Mr Gurvinder
13/01/24, 10:15 am - Gurvinder: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
13/01/24, 10:47 am - +260 772287526: Yes sir it is
13/01/24, 11:37 am - Gurvinder: You see Edoofa’s vision to provide every student with an education that is not just affordable but accessible and employable as well can only be achieved by utilizing the infrastructure of Indian Education landscape that has been developed over the last 75+ years since India’s Independence.

15/01/24, 10:11 am - Gurvinder: So now Aaron, I hope you must have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead. As of now would you like to ask anything so far?
15/01/24, 9:20 pm - Gurvinder: Dear, I was expecting your response in the counseling session, but you could not get back to me due to some reason so I am about to finish my second counseling slot for the day, I will have to schedule your session for *Tomorrow at 10 am CAT*. 

Please note that I have two counseling slots in a day which are during my working hours from *7:30 am to 4:30 pm CAT Monday to Friday*, so to complete your application you would have to be present during that time. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning. Therefore I would like you to be online at the above-mentioned time for a smooth conversation.

16/01/24, 8:57 am - +260 772287526: Good morning sir
16/01/24, 9:34 am - Gurvinder: Please address this.
16/01/24, 9:37 am - +260 772287526: I would love to find out what it takes for you to be an Edofian
16/01/24, 9:47 am - Gurvinder: Please right now, you just have to focus on the counselling session, for the rest you will be guided by me.
16/01/24, 9:56 am - +260 772287526: Alright thanks
16/01/24, 10:12 am - Gurvinder: So now moving ahead by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India?
16/01/24, 10:49 pm - Gurvinder: Hi Dear, I hope you are doing well.

I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons that I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship. 

I hope to get a positive response from you soon.
