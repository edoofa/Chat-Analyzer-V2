*"The magic in new beginnings is truly the most powerful of them all."*

*Happy New Year to you and your family.*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
02/01/24, 10:42 am - +27 62 700 4023: Morning 

Happy New year
02/01/24, 11:51 am - Gurvinder: Let me now brief you about the program.
02/01/24, 11:52 am - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
02/01/24, 11:52 am - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
02/01/24, 11:52 am - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
02/01/24, 11:52 am - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
02/01/24, 5:05 pm - +27 62 700 4023: Yes it’s exactly what I’m looking for  especially the independent part
02/01/24, 8:03 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
03/01/24, 9:24 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

*“Don't let what you cannot do interfere with what you can do.”*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
03/01/24, 9:25 am - +27 62 700 4023: Morning 
How do we participate actively and engage in the program?
03/01/24, 10:00 am - Gurvinder: Okay so Natalie, as we start your counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
03/01/24, 10:08 am - +27 62 700 4023: Yes I’ll be able to do so
03/01/24, 10:19 am - Gurvinder: Now Natalie, I would like to know you better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about yourself, your career aspiration do include sharing about:-

1. Your highest education level?
2. The course you would like to study?
3. What do your parents do?
4. What is your parent’s highest education level?
5. Who has been supporting you for your Education so far?
6. Who will be supporting you financially for your higher education abroad?
7. Do you have any siblings? if yes, what do they do?
8. May I know which school do you study at and in which province is it located along with that how much was your per-term fee in Grade 12?

Please elaborate on your answers and answer them in points, so that I can understand your application more briefly and assist you in a better way
03/01/24, 4:27 pm - Gurvinder: Dear, I was expecting your response in the counseling session, but you could not get back to me due to some reason so I am about to finish my second counseling slot for the day, I will have to schedule your session for *Tomorrow at 9 am CAT*. 

Please note that I have two counseling slots in a day which are during my working hours from *7:30 am to 4:30 pm CAT Monday to Friday*, so to complete your application you would have to be present during that time. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning. Therefore I would like you to be online at the above-mentioned time for a smooth conversation.
03/01/24, 4:28 pm - +27 62 700 4023: Okay I’ll do so wasn’t aware
04/01/24, 9:07 am - +27 62 700 4023: Morning can we start our sessions tomorrow we’ve had a major power cut in our area which leads to network disruptions
04/01/24, 9:26 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

“*It is only when we take chances, when our lives improve*”

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
05/01/24, 7:01 am - +27 62 700 4023: My name is Natalie Makanakaishe Kurewa. I’m an 18 year old who’s very passionate about school in terms of academics. I absolutely love working under pressure. My highest education level is A level . I did a crash course for my A level I wrote sooner than expected. The course I’m looking forward to studying is mechatronics engineering or chemical engineering I’m stuck between these two though I’m really passionate about both. My dads an Accountant by profession and my moms a stay at home mom who does various things at different times. My dad’s highest level of education was university and my moms was O level. My dad has been supporting me for my education up until now but it hasn’t been consistent our relationship is not stable at all some months he would simply refuse to pay for my fees and I would end up just being at home. My extended family said they would try to make sure I have fees for my higher education as well as my sister because my dad is unpredictable. I have 2 siblings the first is an IT specialist and an author the second is a university student she’s now in her third year. For my last 2 years of highschool I went to a private institution whereby you’re able to have one on one lessons with a tutor since I was doing a crash course per month we payed $220 which meant per term it would be $660.
05/01/24, 9:30 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

“*It is only when we take chances, when our lives improve*”

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
05/01/24, 11:06 am - +27 62 700 4023: I’ve sent the paragraph you had requested
05/01/24, 11:40 am - Gurvinder: It is a pleasure to know you, Natalie.
05/01/24, 11:40 am - Gurvinder: As you know the evaluation of your application begins in this counseling session, followed by the eligibility check by our Academic Board. We make sure the opportunity is provided to deserving students who are well inclined to their career paths. Therefore our Academic Board would also take the remarks on your academics and extracurriculars from your school, required in the process
05/01/24, 11:40 am - Gurvinder: Can you please share the name and contact of your School Headmaster/Head Mistress to receive feedback regarding the same?
05/01/24, 11:48 am - +27 62 700 4023: Brett Kandonzvo.vcf (file attached)
05/01/24, 11:50 am - +27 62 700 4023: That’s Mr brett
05/01/24, 12:09 pm - Gurvinder: Noted.
05/01/24, 12:10 pm - Gurvinder: So now as we proceed ahead, I have a question, during your introduction you mentioned you would like to study mechatronics engineering, could you please share what motivates you behind this field of study?
05/01/24, 12:15 pm - +27 62 700 4023: Before I even decided to do this degree what made me to even look into the engineering field was because I wanted to be something different in my family there are a lot of lawyers and doctors and by nature other people tell their kids to walk the same path they walked because they know they’ll succeed since they did the same . As for me I want to walk my own path and discover everything that I can and explore and figure out life by myself not to be given a journey to walk on a golden platter. That’s how I decided I want to go for engineering. What motivated me to choose mechatronics engineering specifically was because of my love for computers and electrical stuff so this degree is a combination of that it ventures into electromechanical systems which is deeper
05/01/24, 12:32 pm - +27 62 700 4023: +27 61 279 7799
05/01/24, 12:40 pm - Gurvinder: Your determination to chart your own course is truly inspiring. It takes courage to venture into a field different from the familiar paths in your family. The blend of computer science and electrical components in mechatronics engineering perfectly aligns with your passion and curiosity for technology.
05/01/24, 12:40 pm - Gurvinder: So if I may ask from your family or known circle has anyone pursued a career in this field?
05/01/24, 12:42 pm - +27 62 700 4023: No one has pursued the exact degree but one of my cousins has done chemical engineering
05/01/24, 1:02 pm - Gurvinder: Natalie, as you told that you depend on your elder sister for higher education, don't you think, she should be a part of this session?
05/01/24, 1:04 pm - +27 62 700 4023: Yes I do but she would like it to follow under my mom
05/01/24, 1:08 pm - Gurvinder: Noted.
05/01/24, 1:09 pm - Gurvinder: Alright so now can you share your O Level and Form 5 results for evaluation?
05/01/24, 1:29 pm - +27 62 700 4023: I’ll do so
05/01/24, 1:55 pm - +27 62 700 4023: <Media omitted>
05/01/24, 2:00 pm - Gurvinder: Are these Grade 12 results?
05/01/24, 2:01 pm - +27 62 700 4023: These are o level results my A levels are yet to come out
05/01/24, 2:01 pm - +27 62 700 4023: In South Africa this is equivalent to grade 12 though
05/01/24, 2:03 pm - Gurvinder: Can you please share you A-level subjects then?
05/01/24, 4:03 pm - +27 62 700 4023: Mathematics, geography and chemistry
05/01/24, 4:04 pm - Gurvinder: May I know that why did you not take Physics as a subject if you wanted to Mechatronics Engineering?
05/01/24, 4:06 pm - +27 62 700 4023: I decided to not take physics because in terms of maths I did mechanics which is actually physics so my maths was branched into mechanics and statistics so I felt like doing physics would’ve been too much pressure
06/01/24, 9:34 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

*I would like to inform you that today's session is only till 1.30 PM CAT*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
06/01/24, 10:35 am - +27 62 700 4023: Morning have you seen this response?
06/01/24, 11:36 am - Gurvinder: Please, I have read this, if you would have researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which the Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student wants to study any Engineering Course then they should have *Physics, Chemistry and Maths* in their A level mandatorily.
06/01/24, 12:09 pm - +27 62 700 4023: What if it’s chemical engineering
06/01/24, 12:14 pm - Gurvinder: I noticed that you also had an intereset in Computer Science, may I know what do you think about that?
06/01/24, 12:22 pm - +27 62 700 4023: Yes I would also take it as it connects with softwares and electronics
06/01/24, 12:29 pm - Gurvinder: After understanding your interests and motivation toward the Subject
According to my expertise, the following course will cater to all your likings and will help you achieve your future goals:

*Bachelor of Computer Application*
08/01/24, 8:17 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
08/01/24, 8:42 am - +27 62 700 4023: Morning !
08/01/24, 8:59 am - Gurvinder: Please address this.
08/01/24, 9:32 am - +27 62 700 4023: I did my research on Computer Application and how it connects with software engineering. I’m happy with what I’ve researched on it and would do it
08/01/24, 9:44 am - Gurvinder: That is great, did you understand the course or shall I also brief you?
08/01/24, 9:52 am - +27 62 700 4023: It would also be good if you brief me
08/01/24, 10:01 am - Gurvinder: *Bachelor of Computer Application* course graduates have a variety of career options after completion of the course. Apart from pursuing higher study course such as MCA or any related course, students can secure a job in diverse areas such as software development, banks, ITES, government departments, Education, etc.
08/01/24, 10:01 am - Gurvinder: *What is it About?*

BCA Course is a study of computer science and its related applications. It is said to be one of the most sought-after courses for students who wish to make a career in the IT field.

*Job profiles for BCA graduates are:*

	*Programmers*
	*System Analyst*
	*Network Designer*
	*Game Developers and Testers*
	*System Manager*
08/01/24, 10:39 am - +27 62 700 4023: This makes more sense thank you
08/01/24, 10:44 am - Gurvinder: Since you have understood the course properly can you now tell me in 150 to 200 words that if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself 5 years after the completion of this course and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
08/01/24, 11:20 am - +27 62 700 4023: Firstly getting in the endoofa program will help me achieve my dreams In a better way  and calm way because this program will really remove a lot of problems for me knowing that there’s someone who is committed to my fees because for my highschool journey this really affected me and at time’s studying would even be difficult due to this . Going abroad as an African child also gives you somewhere to start after the completion of the course and as for me it would not just be a course because it deals with things that I’m passionate about that I want to explore more into . As you mentioned that it’s also a course for students who want to have a career in the IT field this would also mean dealing with physical devices and computers as well which would also have the same impact I wanted. After the completion of this course the job profile I would choose to be a programmer and I know after 5 years I’ll be a great person due to this course and the knowledge it will give me
08/01/24, 11:27 am - Gurvinder: That is really great Natalie I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations,

However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

Are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way inorder to transform your career dear?
08/01/24, 11:33 am - +27 62 700 4023: Yes I am and definitely will
Throughout my academic life I’ve always lived with the motto make the impossible be possible
08/01/24, 11:39 am - Gurvinder: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
08/01/24, 11:45 am - +27 62 700 4023: For courses that are more practical they’ve got limited resources people here mostly go for stuff like law criminology and economics whereas abroad you have more exposure to stuff required for your degree
08/01/24, 11:47 am - Gurvinder: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
08/01/24, 1:11 pm - +27 62 700 4023: Since I’ll be learning from the technological stuff in my years would be to introduce more software systems in the educational system that are being used abroad and to also help others think big and not limit themselves when it comes to degrees , so that they may know they’re well capable
08/01/24, 1:35 pm - Gurvinder: I appreciate your sense of hardworking for your community Natalie, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?
08/01/24, 1:44 pm - +27 62 700 4023: I do agree but the perspective I view it from is let’s say for instance after you’ve completed your course and have gained so much knowledge and experience and maybe able to develop new things you’re then able to bring that home and give it out to others that did not have the opportunities you had and also the Zimbabwean government it’s very easier than other countries to sort of contribute to the government
08/01/24, 1:45 pm - Gurvinder: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
08/01/24, 1:48 pm - +27 62 700 4023: Yes I am
08/01/24, 1:48 pm - Gurvinder: You see Edoofa’s vision to provide every student with an education that is not just affordable but accessible and employable as well can only be achieved by utilizing the infrastructure of Indian Education landscape that has been developed over the last 75+ years since India’s Independence.
08/01/24, 1:48 pm - Gurvinder: *Following are the reasons as to Why Edoofa Focuses on India for Scholarships: A Quick Look!*

1. *Robust Education System:* India has 1000+ universities and 39,931 colleges offering diverse educational paths.

2. *Renowned Institutions:* Top-rated Indian universities cover a wide array of fields from engineering to journalism.

08/01/24, 2:08 pm - +27 62 700 4023: That was a lot to digest but I do understand everything
08/01/24, 2:09 pm - Gurvinder: So now Natalie, I hope you must have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead. As of now would you like to ask anything so far?
08/01/24, 2:11 pm - +27 62 700 4023: Do you choose the university you want to go to in India or Edoofa chooses
08/01/24, 2:12 pm - Gurvinder: Please, you can choose between any University that send you the acceptance letter.
08/01/24, 2:14 pm - +27 62 700 4023: Okay I understand
08/01/24, 2:16 pm - Gurvinder: So now moving ahead by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India?
08/01/24, 2:37 pm - +27 62 700 4023: For India No
08/01/24, 2:39 pm - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
08/01/24, 2:39 pm - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
08/01/24, 2:39 pm - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
08/01/24, 2:39 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
08/01/24, 2:39 pm - Gurvinder: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*

*after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
08/01/24, 3:17 pm - +27 62 700 4023: Okay it makes sense and affordable
08/01/24, 3:18 pm - Gurvinder: This message was deleted
08/01/24, 3:18 pm - Gurvinder: So now shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?
08/01/24, 3:19 pm - +27 62 700 4023: Yes please
08/01/24, 3:21 pm - Gurvinder: Natalie, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
08/01/24, 3:38 pm - +27 62 700 4023: So the EWYL runs through until you finish your course?
08/01/24, 3:39 pm - Gurvinder: Yes, that is correct.
08/01/24, 3:41 pm - +27 62 700 4023: Okay I understand
08/01/24, 3:46 pm - Gurvinder: The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

*1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-_*Africa Global Radio*_ - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

-_*Skooqs*_ - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
08/01/24, 3:46 pm - Gurvinder: *2. Recruitment Partners: -*

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
08/01/24, 3:47 pm - Gurvinder: *3. Webinars: -*

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
_Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world_ by *Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade*.
_How to network like a boss_ by *Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi*

08/01/24, 3:47 pm - Gurvinder: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase. 

*What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
08/01/24, 8:44 pm - Gurvinder: Dear, I was expecting your response in the counseling session, but you could not get back to me due to some reason so I am about to finish my second counseling slot for the day, I will have to schedule your session for *Tomorrow at 9 am CAT*. 

Please note that I have two counseling slots in a day which are during my working hours from *7:30 am to 4:30 pm CAT Monday to Friday*, so to complete your application you would have to be present during that time. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning. Therefore I would like you to be online at the above-mentioned time for a smooth conversation.
09/01/24, 9:37 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

*“Success is peace of mind, which is a direct result of self-satisfaction in knowing you made the effort to become the best of which you are capable.”*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
09/01/24, 9:42 am - +27 62 700 4023: Morning
09/01/24, 10:10 am - Gurvinder: Please address this.
09/01/24, 12:48 pm - Gurvinder: Well Dear, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but I am under the weather today and unable to continue the sessions today, so, I would connect with you tomorrow again at 9 AM CAT to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care.

Have a good day ahead. 
God Bless You!
10/01/24, 8:37 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

*Excuse me for yesterday, I was under the weather and had a bad fever.*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
10/01/24, 11:28 am - +27 62 700 4023: Apologies for the late reply I was still trying to understand everything before replying and yes I do think this will benefit me
10/01/24, 11:46 am - Gurvinder: Please you should have shared that with me right, that you are still trying to understand that?
10/01/24, 11:47 am - Gurvinder: If a student stops replying to me then I have to put a closure on their application, and I don't think you want that, is that right?
10/01/24, 12:32 pm - +27 62 700 4023: No I don’t
10/01/24, 12:36 pm - Gurvinder: I am delighted to hear that Natalie, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
10/01/24, 12:38 pm - +27 62 700 4023: Now I have a better understanding of the EWYL program
10/01/24, 12:41 pm - +27 62 700 4023: So it’s all online?
10/01/24, 12:41 pm - Gurvinder: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

10/01/24, 12:41 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
10/01/24, 12:41 pm - Gurvinder: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
10/01/24, 12:43 pm - +27 62 700 4023: Yes I now see the difference
10/01/24, 12:44 pm - +27 62 700 4023: Let’s say you get a 100% scholarship can you still be part of the EWYL program?
10/01/24, 12:45 pm - Gurvinder: Yes, that is correct.
10/01/24, 12:48 pm - +27 62 700 4023: It all makes sense now
10/01/24, 12:51 pm - Gurvinder: Alright Natalie, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
10/01/24, 12:54 pm - +27 62 700 4023: Yes they will
10/01/24, 12:58 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so may I know if you have discussed international education plans with them in depth?
10/01/24, 1:35 pm - +27 62 700 4023: Yes I have discussed most of it with them
10/01/24, 1:49 pm - Gurvinder: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
10/01/24, 1:57 pm - +27 62 700 4023: I’m ready
10/01/24, 2:00 pm - Gurvinder: Natalie as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
10/01/24, 2:04 pm - +27 62 700 4023: It would be about $2250 max
10/01/24, 3:37 pm - Gurvinder: Exactly Natalie, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
10/01/24, 3:37 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
10/01/24, 3:39 pm - +27 62 700 4023: Oh okay that really makes it affordable for parents and doesn’t become a strain
10/01/24, 3:57 pm - Gurvinder: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
10/01/24, 4:03 pm - +27 62 700 4023: Yes it really is
10/01/24, 4:08 pm - Gurvinder: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
10/01/24, 4:08 pm - Gurvinder: Basically, there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee, before their Grade 12 result is out).


Phase 3: Once the final grade 12 results are out, if the student would have passed the necessary requirement (of 4 Grade 12 passes.) then start with their University Interaction. If the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents.


The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.

However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
10/01/24, 4:12 pm - +27 62 700 4023: Okay I understand
10/01/24, 4:18 pm - Gurvinder: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.

Are you familiar with the Edoofa Cycle?
10/01/24, 4:21 pm - +27 62 700 4023: <Media omitted>
10/01/24, 4:28 pm - Gurvinder: Yes
10/01/24, 4:29 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
10/01/24, 4:29 pm - Gurvinder: Alright Natalie, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in South Africa itself.
10/01/24, 4:29 pm - Gurvinder: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
10/01/24, 4:33 pm - +27 62 700 4023: Yes I understand
10/01/24, 4:34 pm - Gurvinder: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of the registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
10/01/24, 4:34 pm - Gurvinder: Basically, this registration fee will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August/September 2024 and the remaining in January next year 2025.
10/01/24, 4:34 pm - Gurvinder: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
10/01/24, 4:34 pm - Gurvinder: So now would you like to ask anything?
10/01/24, 4:35 pm - +27 62 700 4023: No everything is clear
10/01/24, 4:35 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check
10/01/24, 4:35 pm - Gurvinder: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
10/01/24, 4:35 pm - Gurvinder: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

Parent participation is mandatory in this session, failure to attend would result in the cancellation of the application.
10/01/24, 4:37 pm - +27 62 700 4023: Okay thank you so much
11/01/24, 10:02 am - Gurvinder: Hello @27627004023 @27845734049 .
