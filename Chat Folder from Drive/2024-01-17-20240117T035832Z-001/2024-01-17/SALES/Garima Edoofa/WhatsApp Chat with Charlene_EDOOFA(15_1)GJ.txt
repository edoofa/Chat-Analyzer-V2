I would like to know you better as a student so please go ahead, tell me a bit about yourself, your education, what course you would like to study, how much was your  every term fee, along with what do you wish to study, your strengths and weaknesses, and your hobbies, since I honestly don't know a lot about you?

15/01/24, 2:17 pm - +263 78 457 9175: I'm sure I would have settled by then
15/01/24, 2:18 pm - Garima Edoofa: Alright, please.
15/01/24, 4:11 pm - +263 78 457 9175: Sorry to keep you waiting
15/01/24, 4:11 pm - +263 78 457 9175: I would describe myself as an honest and open person who tries to be fair in everything I do. I learn new things quickly than others and makes me a good learner. I am hardworking and can face challenges.  

I am 19 years old. I finished my A level at First Choice College in Harare. I wrote Cambridge examinations and I was doing science subjects. I have a D in Chem, E in Maths and E in Biology. From a very young age, science has been my passion. However my interest in science turned into wanting to study medicine. I want to spend time learning about medicine and skills that will let me solve all kinds of medical problems. Even with the challenge of spending a lot of time into becoming a doctor, I know that with this effort I can find it very rewarding and I will never be bored.

My strengths:  I love learning new things and can learn very fast and I feel I will be able to learn about medicine quickly. I am also a good listener and communicator which will help me to listen to patients and communicate with them on the required treatments when I become a doctor. I also have my weaknesses which are I am afraid of speaking in public but while I was in high school I joined a debate club to improve on this area and I have noticed a great improvements. I am also not good at making decisions which may be caused by self criticism but after spending sometime alone it encourages me to rethink on the poor decisions I had made and understand myself better.

My father is an accountant by profession and my mother is an executive assistant at a private company. We are 3 in our family and I am the eldest. I have a sister who is 13 years old and is in form one. The youngest is my brother who is 10years old and in grade six.
15/01/24, 4:11 pm - +263 78 457 9175: For fees. At my current school we were paying $150 per month.

15/01/24, 4:20 pm - Garima Edoofa: Alright, Charlene, I hope your parents are aware that you have applied for the scholarship program that would lead you to study abroad? Along with that may I know are they willing to support you financially in your higher education abroad?
15/01/24, 4:21 pm - +263 77 158 4599: We are aware of her application.It is our desire to assist her to the extent that we can
15/01/24, 4:25 pm - Garima Edoofa: I appreciate that, please may I know if you are financially prepared for the same?
15/01/24, 4:26 pm - Garima Edoofa: @263784579175 As you know the evaluation of your application begins in this counselling session, followed by the eligibility check by our Academic Board.

16/01/24, 9:34 am - Garima Edoofa: Good Morning @263771584599 @263784579175 @263774852710 , hope you are doing well.
16/01/24, 9:34 am - Garima Edoofa: I am here to continue with our session, shall we start?
16/01/24, 9:39 am - +263 78 457 9175: Goodmorning  maam
16/01/24, 9:39 am - +263 78 457 9175: Oh yes we can
16/01/24, 9:40 am - +263 77 158 4599: Good morning to you too
16/01/24, 9:46 am - +263 77 485 2710: Good morning
16/01/24, 9:49 am - Garima Edoofa: Well  as you mentioned that it is your desire to study medicine, but it is very unfortunate that we don't offer medicine as a course because of the following reasons:


1. Affordability: Medicine is one of the most expensive courses everywhere in the world, as it requires high-class facilities and great doctors and mentors to teach that.
 
2. Eligibility: India is a great place to study for higher education as it has both qualities of education and affordability, but for medicine in India, you need to give an entrance exam named NEET, which is very competitive and only 1000 students are selected from millions each year.
 
3. Length of the program: Medicine is a 6-8 years course including the internships(attachment) that are mandatory, so it also contributes to the affordability issue.
 
But I realize that you want to do a course that makes your parents proud and also align with your passion. So you can go ahead with the courses in Medical Field such as
 
1. Bachelor of Science in Nursing
2. Bachelors in  Pharmacy
3. Bachelors in Physiotherapy
4. Bachelor of Science in Medical Lab Technology 
 
These courses have a lesser duration than Medicine and are more affordable for students.
16/01/24, 9:51 am - +263 78 457 9175: I understand physiotherapy as a branch of science that deals with bones and doing physical therapy for that <This message was edited>
16/01/24, 9:52 am - +263 78 457 9175: So how long is that course and what are my take aways from it if I indulge in it.
16/01/24, 10:21 am - Garima Edoofa: May I know if a Bachelor in physiotherapy aligns with you?
16/01/24, 10:22 am - +263 78 457 9175: Not really. But according to the list above I'm taking it into consideration
16/01/24, 10:46 am - Garima Edoofa: Shall I brief you about the course?
16/01/24, 10:50 am - +263 78 457 9175: Yes sure. I need more clarity please
16/01/24, 11:02 am - Garima Edoofa: *Bachelor in Physiotherapy* is a branch of healthcare that applies modes of physical movement such as exercise, massage, besides education, advice, and counselling services to circumstances where movement and function are threatened by ageing, pain, injury, diseases, disorders, conditions, or other environmental factors.

Students enrolled to the course are taught on an advanced level about core physiotherapeutic skills such as manual therapy, therapeutic exercises, and application of electro-physical modalities, which have been proven to cure a range of disabilities and disease related to spine, back, neck, and even stress-related incontinence.

Bachelor of Physiotherapy is a 4-year undergraduate course, including compulsory 6 months of clinical internship, and involving the science of physical movement aimed at preventing disease and disability.

The opportunities for a career in Physiotherapy are excellent, whether in the public health system, private practice or non-government organisations. Career pathways include the disciplines and areas of:

*Healthcare Management*
*Industrial Rehabilitation*
*Research & Academics*
*Special Schools*
*Multinational companies for fitness of their employers*
16/01/24, 11:03 am - +263 78 457 9175: Let me read this
16/01/24, 11:05 am - Garima Edoofa: Yes, please and inform me once you are done.
16/01/24, 11:11 am - +263 78 457 9175: Yes I'm done
16/01/24, 11:14 am - Garima Edoofa: May I know if this course aligns with you?
16/01/24, 11:14 am - +263 78 457 9175: This sounds interesting.. So after doing my 6 months internship am I allowed to advance from there or  I need to work for a certain number of years before I get  to do my masters
16/01/24, 11:22 am - Garima Edoofa: surely let me help you with your concern here. Yes after completing her studies in India she will be employable globally. As you may know, each university offers courses with varying durations. In Zimbabwe, it is referred to as *industrial attachment* or *work internships*. India refers to it as *" placements."* Every university affiliated with the Edoofa Program has its own dedicated placement cell. Their primary mission is to ensure that all students secure placements in their pre-final year of education.
16/01/24, 11:22 am - Garima Edoofa: When students reach their pre-final year, they participate in placement drives conducted by various multinational corporations, startups, and organizations. During these drives, students go through interviews, and if they demonstrate proficiency, they end up receiving job offers from these companies. Depending on the job offer, students have the option to apply for a work permit that allows them to extend their stay in India for the duration of their employment.
16/01/24, 11:22 am - Garima Edoofa: Moreover, the EWYL program for you is specifically designed so that you as a student are able to learn the 21st-century skills which are certainly required for every student to be employable ready. Through EWYL you will boost your confidence which is going to help you in the future and with the skills learned you will definitely be employable ready. It depends upon the student how much they are willing to learn from the program.
16/01/24, 11:22 am - Garima Edoofa: I hope this provides the clarity you were seeking. If you are satisfied, shall we continue with our discussion and move forward?
16/01/24, 11:25 am - +263 78 457 9175: Sure let's continue
16/01/24, 11:25 am - +263 78 457 9175: Thank you for the information
16/01/24, 12:29 pm - Garima Edoofa: Alright, 
Since you have understood the course properly.

Can you now tell me, if you are provided with this career option, how do you see yourself 5 years after the completion of this course?
And if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
16/01/24, 1:24 pm - +263 78 457 9175: Physiotherapy gives me a time advantage of getting into the field early and implement what I have learnt at school much earlier.

After 5 years of completion I see myself :
1: As a person who is now able to be of great help to the social community we live in, by providing basic education to people on the importance of getting physiotherapy without anyone judging my capabilities just from the internet. 
2: I see myself being held in prestigious posts and being an example through the Zimbabwean community as I would have raised the slogan # Girl child in a prominent positions.
3:I  see myself globally networked with other physicians, helping and giving each other suitable add on knowledge that's not just from written work but from experiences in the line of work.
4: I see myself innovating some practices that go well with this program that will help in training people with physical ailments
5: Over whelmed with joy working under such a branch that is connected to getting people better. And I see mysf trying by all means to help in anyway I can to make them feel better.
16/01/24, 1:26 pm - +263 78 457 9175: Getting into Edoofa to me is not just the scholarship for me but it's about how supportive this program is.
For me Edoofa will help me achieve my dreams by :
1: Offering me to learn at good universities and getting knowledge from the best tutors world wide.
2: Growing up I always wanted to be an ambassador of prestigious programs so getting into Edoofa I know I will get that chance to ambassador this name and take it to greater heights.
3: My aim in life was always to make my family proud of me and making the flag high for my family. So as an Edoofa I will get to experience that kind of pride within me.
4: it gives me a well vast connection with other people in different countries allowing me to be connected to different people and learning different culture and teaching me on how to get along with people of different ethnic backgrounds.
16/01/24, 1:26 pm - Garima Edoofa: I appreciate and admire your foresightedness at the same time, Charlene.

However, as your concierge, I would like to share with you that the career path which you have chosen ahead, will require a lot of hard work and dedication.

So are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way in order to transform your career dear?
16/01/24, 1:27 pm - +263 78 457 9175: Thank you maam
16/01/24, 1:27 pm - +263 78 457 9175: I'm willing to give it my all and do my level best
16/01/24, 1:39 pm - Garima Edoofa: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
16/01/24, 1:45 pm - +263 78 457 9175: Studying abroad gives me that advantage to get connected with people with different perspectives and different innovative ideas.
It give that that advantage to get placements in different countries whilst I'm done with school.
Financially learning abroad is cheaper and affordable.
16/01/24, 1:45 pm - +263 78 457 9175: It also give me the opportunity to find myself and discover my capabilities in the world and make new friends <This message was edited>
16/01/24, 2:23 pm - Garima Edoofa: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
16/01/24, 2:49 pm - +263 78 457 9175: I will contribute in the following ways:
•providing the best possible healthcare gained through my studies
•promote inter-cultural integration and tolerance as I will be a product of that thereby promoting peace and harmonious living in the world.Help in doing away with prejudice
•Promote other up and coming generations to embark in the same field as I will exhibit examplary and profession behaviour
•show my fellow countrymen that the world has become a village by showcasing my Indian language prowess and it's diverse and rich cultures
16/01/24, 2:49 pm - +263 78 457 9175: •set up a foundation to assist the disadvantaged to access quality education as I am a product of same assistance
16/01/24, 2:55 pm - Garima Edoofa: I appreciate your sense of hard work for your community charlene, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?
16/01/24, 3:04 pm - +263 78 457 9175: That's very true maam. Environment is one of the biggest determining factor of whether one succeeds or not. I believe that this scholarship program is not only going to provide me with the intricacies of my chosen trade but will provide me with an environment that will make it possible for me to thrive
16/01/24, 3:11 pm - Garima Edoofa: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
16/01/24, 3:12 pm - +263 78 457 9175: Ooh yes that's very true.

16/01/24, 3:16 pm - +263 78 457 9175: Thank you for the information. Let me read it for now
16/01/24, 3:19 pm - Garima Edoofa: Yes, please.

let me know when you are done.
16/01/24, 3:25 pm - +263 78 457 9175: Impressive resume and commendations.One can only wish and dream to be part of the impending Indian awakening
16/01/24, 3:27 pm - Garima Edoofa: Okay well Charlene, since you have understood all the reasons properly as well, can you now tell me:-

1)How would studying in India implement a positive impact on your career?

2)How do you aim to achieve your career aspirations from studying in India?
16/01/24, 3:40 pm - +263 78 457 9175: Studying in India will impact on my career in the following ways:
•I will be tutored and guided by some of the most competent minds in the area
•As there is cross-pollination between class and industry,I get to have first hand practical experience whilst still in class

I expect to achieve my career aspirations in the following ways:
•There are already working structures in place in India which have allowed some to be CEOs of international companies which I will make use of.
•The list of rich women in India shows that gender is no bar in Indian society-you can succeed regardless
•The moving in of big organizations like Tesla into the Indian market means creation of more opportunities for all concerned
16/01/24, 4:00 pm - Garima Edoofa: That is remarkable, Charlene. I see that you understand the quality of higher education that Edoofa seeks to deliver to its students so that after completing the education, the student is capable of achieving their career goals and having a prosperous career ahead of them.

Okay, so are you or any of your family members aware of the expense of a comparable quality higher education for an international student without a scholarship in India?
16/01/24, 4:14 pm - +263 78 457 9175: Thank you. I'm not aware of the cost.
16/01/24, 4:15 pm - Garima Edoofa: Let me help you brief about the cost.
16/01/24, 4:15 pm - +263 78 457 9175: Okay
16/01/24, 4:17 pm - Garima Edoofa: Before moving ahead, could you please send me your A-level result?
16/01/24, 4:18 pm - +263 77 158 4599: <Media omitted>
16/01/24, 4:20 pm - Garima Edoofa: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is *around 6000-8000 USD. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from USD 15000 to USD 35000. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 6-year degree ranging from USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000*.

Now as we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with over 250+ Universities for the last 14 + years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 5 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
16/01/24, 4:20 pm - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
16/01/24, 4:20 pm - Garima Edoofa: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:


*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
16/01/24, 4:20 pm - Garima Edoofa: So, don't you think it is affordable for your family?
16/01/24, 4:24 pm - +263 78 457 9175: It's indeed affordable for my family.
16/01/24, 4:31 pm - Garima Edoofa: In simple words Charlene what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*


*Shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?*
16/01/24, 4:33 pm - +263 78 457 9175: Yes sure I would like to know more about the program.
16/01/24, 4:38 pm - Garima Edoofa: The Earn While You Learn Program or the *EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program*. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
16/01/24, 4:39 pm - Garima Edoofa: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.


1. *Projects with Brands and Companies*: -

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

-Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
16/01/24, 4:39 pm - Garima Edoofa: 2. *Recruitment Partners*: -

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
16/01/24, 4:39 pm - Garima Edoofa: 3. *Webinars*: -

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi
How to be industry ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu
It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje
Decoding the science of personal branding by Mr, Simon Maingi
16/01/24, 4:39 pm - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
16/01/24, 4:39 pm - Garima Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases. 

What are your views on the same? Do you think this will be benefiting you?
16/01/24, 4:51 pm - +263 78 457 9175: Very enlightening and a very innovative way of grooming prospect leaders.I can envision myself already being part of the community
16/01/24, 6:17 pm - Garima Edoofa: That is great to know, so now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food, and accommodation*, which means for the monthly family cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
16/01/24, 6:17 pm - Garima Edoofa: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

16/01/24, 6:41 pm - +263 78 457 9175: This is an ingenious way of helping students fund their own education.Its very innovative
16/01/24, 7:09 pm - Garima Edoofa: Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :

1.*Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*​: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses,which is completely waived off.
 
2.*Employability through practical training*​: We believe Students shouldn't just learn in theory, they should gain real-world experience instead of academic theory. That is why we help them by designing a practical employment oriented curriculum that helps students pick up job skills needed to be employable.
 
 
3.*Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing and involving. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What’s more, students earn scholarship credits in the process, thereby further reducing the burden of the cost of their education.
 
 
4.*Higher Education Concierge*​: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.
16/01/24, 7:10 pm - Garima Edoofa: So, after looking over the facts that distinguish Edoofa, which of the four points did you appreciate the most?
16/01/24, 9:29 pm - Garima Edoofa: I was expecting your response, but it seems you are occupied at the moment, so I will have to schedule your session for tomorrow at 9:30 AM CAT as my working hours are over for the day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above-mentioned time for a smooth conversation*

16/01/24, 9:33 pm - Garima Edoofa: I would want you to go through this video as it will give you more insights of the program from the students itself.
