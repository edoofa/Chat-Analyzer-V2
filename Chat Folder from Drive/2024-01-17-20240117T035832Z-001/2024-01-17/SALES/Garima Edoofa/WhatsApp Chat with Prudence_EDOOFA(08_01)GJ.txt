11/01/24, 2:25 pm - Garima Edoofa: Well,
With your interest in the medical field, may I know why you didn't opt for Biology for A level?
11/01/24, 2:28 pm - +263 78 906 8514: Because at the time i was still caught up between engineering and medicine so I ended up doing physics because it is needed for both programmes
11/01/24, 2:46 pm - Garima Edoofa: I can understand,
Let me tell you ,Biology is a mandatory subject for medical science as it lays the background for medical courses.Therefore I regret to inform you that your combination is not eligible for Medical programs.
But may I know what other career aspirations do you have,please

I do understand ,Since Medical Education and Engineering are two aspects for which the Indian Education System is known, both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are Physics, Chemistry, and Biology. whereas if they want to study any Engineering Course then they should have Physics and Mathematics in their A level mandatorily.

Can you now tell me, if you are provided with this career option, how do you see yourself 5 years after the completion of this course?
And if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
13/01/24, 10:06 am - +263 78 906 8514: After 5years of completing this course i see myself having opened a chemist shop in the rural areas because people there especially the elderly have to travel long distances(3hour-5hour journies) to buy their medication.Edoofa would help me to achieve my dream of being in the medical field and helping out here in my country to make the medicinal facilities more available in places where they are scarce.
13/01/24, 10:07 am - Garima Edoofa: I appreciate and admire your foresightedness at the same time, Prudence

However, as your concierge, I would like to share with you that the career path which you have chosen ahead, will require a lot of hard work and dedication.

So are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way in order to transform your career dear?
13/01/24, 10:08 am - +263 78 906 8514: Yes maam i am willing to put in the needed work and even more if need be
13/01/24, 10:20 am - Garima Edoofa: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
13/01/24, 10:23 am - +263 78 906 8514: Oky in my country most universities donot have most facilities for the science field so we there is less of practical and more of theory
13/01/24, 10:24 am - Garima Edoofa: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
13/01/24, 10:29 am - +263 78 906 8514: By opening chemists shop which will give the students who are studying this side the exposure that i would have gotten abroad.And also try to partner with some universities to help them adopt the education systems of more developed countries
13/01/24, 10:49 am - Garima Edoofa: I appreciate your sense of hard work for your community Prudence, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?
13/01/24, 10:52 am - +263 78 906 8514: Yes it would require alot of dedication and reputation
13/01/24, 11:01 am - Garima Edoofa: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
13/01/24, 11:01 am - Garima Edoofa: Yes, indeed.
13/01/24, 11:17 am - +263 78 906 8514: Yes please enlighten me

13/01/24, 11:28 am - Garima Edoofa: May I know if you understood everything properly?
13/01/24, 11:43 am - +263 78 906 8514: Are these experts which you invite recognised globally or country wide and what are the chances that the students may be employed by them after graduating
13/01/24, 11:58 am - Garima Edoofa: Surely let me help you with your concern here. Yes after completing her studies in India she will be employable globally. As you may know, each university offers courses with varying durations. In Zimbabwe, it is referred to as *industrial attachment* or *work internships*. India refers to it as *" placements."* Every university affiliated with the Edoofa Program has its own dedicated placement cell. Their primary mission is to ensure that all students secure placements in their pre-final year of education.
13/01/24, 11:58 am - Garima Edoofa: When students reach their pre-final year, they participate in placement drives conducted by various multinational corporations, startups, and organizations. During these drives, students go through interviews, and if they demonstrate proficiency, they end up receiving job offers from these companies. Depending on the job offer, students have the option to apply for a work permit that allows them to extend their stay in India for the duration of their employment.
13/01/24, 11:59 am - Garima Edoofa: Moreover, the EWYL program for you is specifically designed so that you as a student are able to learn the 21st-century skills which are certainly required for every student to be employable ready. Through EWYL you will boost your confidence which is going to help you in the future and with the skills learned you will definitely be employable ready. It depends upon the student how much they are willing to learn from the program.
13/01/24, 11:59 am - Garima Edoofa: I hope this provides the clarity you were seeking. If you are satisfied, shall we continue with our discussion and move forward?
13/01/24, 12:02 pm - +263 78 906 8514: Yes please
13/01/24, 12:04 pm - Garima Edoofa: Okay well Prudence, since you have understood all the reasons properly as well, can you now tell me:-

1)How would studying in India have a positive impact on your career?

2)How do you aim to achieve your career aspirations from studying in India?
13/01/24, 12:05 pm - +263 78 906 8514: Sure🙂
13/01/24, 12:06 pm - +263 78 906 8514: It would help me to find employment much quicker as India is a highly ranked country in terms of its education systems
13/01/24, 12:08 pm - +263 78 906 8514: 2).Since India is highly ranked it means being trained there would help me to accomplish my dream of travelling to different countries helping the less privileged in terms of medical assistance and also travelling to those who experince natural disasters to offer medical assistance
13/01/24, 12:26 pm - Garima Edoofa: That is remarkable Prudence. I see that you understand the quality of higher education that Edoofa seeks to deliver to its students so that after completing the education, the student is capable of achieving their career goals and having a prosperous career ahead of them.

Okay, so are you or any of your family members aware of the expense of a comparable quality higher education for an international student without a scholarship in India?
13/01/24, 12:35 pm - +263 77 372 2571: I'm not very knowledgeable about the expenses without a scholarship, may you enlighten me
13/01/24, 12:36 pm - +263 77 372 2571: May you please enlighten me
13/01/24, 12:41 pm - Garima Edoofa: Yes, sure.
13/01/24, 12:42 pm - Garima Edoofa: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is *around 6000-8000 USD. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from USD 15000 to USD 35000. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 6-year degree ranging from USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000*.

Now as we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with over 250+ Universities for the last 14 + years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 5 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
13/01/24, 12:43 pm - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
13/01/24, 12:44 pm - Garima Edoofa: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year, but as some courses are niche in nature like *Bachelor of PHARMCY* itself is a course which has fewer scholarship seats, which is why for you the Annual fee after the scholarship would be between *$2700-$3700*. This cost includes:
	1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)
	2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)
	3. Food
	4. Accommodation
13/01/24, 1:14 pm - +263 78 906 8514: So is the $2700 paid by the parents or a percentage covered for by the edoofa schoolarship
13/01/24, 1:20 pm - Garima Edoofa: In simple words Prudence what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*


*Shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?*
13/01/24, 1:25 pm - Garima Edoofa: Prudence, it will be paid by your parents, but With the help of The Learn While You Earn program students can earn scholarship credits and self carter their annual fee which can also reduce the burden on the parents.
13/01/24, 1:29 pm - +263 78 906 8514: Yes please
13/01/24, 1:29 pm - +263 78 906 8514: Can it get to a point whereby one can pay for themselves through the Learn While You Earn programme
13/01/24, 1:36 pm - Garima Edoofa: The Earn While You Learn Program or the *EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program*. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
13/01/24, 1:36 pm - Garima Edoofa: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.


1. *Projects with Brands and Companies*: -

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4DAP24ZuY4&authuser=0
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0

-Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
13/01/24, 1:37 pm - Garima Edoofa: 2. *Recruitment Partners*: -

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
13/01/24, 1:37 pm - Garima Edoofa: 3. *Webinars*: -

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi
How to be industry ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu
It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje
Decoding the science of personal branding by Mr, Simon Maingi
13/01/24, 1:37 pm - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
13/01/24, 1:37 pm - Garima Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases. 

What are your views on the same? Do you think this will be benefiting you?
13/01/24, 1:43 pm - +263 78 906 8514: Yes especially the one on how to be industry ready before graduating i believe is very essential
13/01/24, 1:44 pm - +263 78 906 8514: So lets say one gets a 100% schoolarship how much of the tuition do they pay
13/01/24, 1:55 pm - Garima Edoofa: Can you please elaborate? What exactly you mean by 100% scholarship?
13/01/24, 2:01 pm - +263 78 906 8514: I am aware that you said that the Edoofa programme offers 50-100% schoolarships.I would like to know if the amount of tuition one pays is different according to the schoolarships they got.
13/01/24, 2:10 pm - Garima Edoofa: let me explain to you that two kinds of programs provide assistance to the students because a lot of times parents and students themselves misunderstand what a Scholarship actually means.

1. Scholarships
2. Sponsorships

Scholarships make education affordable for the students by reducing their Tuition Fees, now a lot of times parents and students consider that a Domestic Scholarship would be the same as an International Scholarship, but to understand the difference between them, consider yourself applying for an education in your own country with the help of a scholarship. Now after the scholarship when your tuition fee would be reduced, eventually your entire cost of education would be reduced because being a citizen of the country, you wouldn't be required to spend any fees on Accommodation and feeding separately since in that case, students would be staying with their families. However, if I personally plan to study in Zimbabwe with the same scholarship, I would have to incur some costs on Accommodation and Feeding because I am not a Zimbabwean Citizen. So a lot of times parents and students consider International Scholarship and Domestic Scholarship one and the same thing, but in reality, they aren't.

Sponsorships, on the other hand, take care entirely of a student's education, but because Sponsorships are provided by only a few organizations, there are a lot of terms and conditions which a student might need to follow in order to get the sponsorship, the most common term is that a student after completion of the course would have to work for the organization providing the sponsorship for a period of time.
13/01/24, 2:20 pm - +263 78 906 8514: Ohh okay i now understand
13/01/24, 2:22 pm - Garima Edoofa: That is great to know, so now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food, and accommodation*, which means for the monthly family cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
13/01/24, 2:22 pm - Garima Edoofa: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.
13/01/24, 2:23 pm - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
13/01/24, 2:29 pm - +263 78 906 8514: Wow dedication really pays. This is really motivational
13/01/24, 2:36 pm - Garima Edoofa: Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :

1.*Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*​: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses,which is completely waived off.
 
2.*Employability through practical training*​: We believe Students shouldn't just learn in theory, they should gain real-world experience instead of academic theory. That is why we help them by designing a practical employment oriented curriculum that helps students pick up job skills needed to be employable.
 
 
3.*Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing and involving. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What’s more, students earn scholarship credits in the process, thereby further reducing the burden of the cost of their education.
 
 
4.*Higher Education Concierge*​: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.
13/01/24, 2:36 pm - Garima Edoofa: So, after looking over the facts that distinguish Edoofa, which of the four points did you appreciate the most?
13/01/24, 2:42 pm - +263 78 906 8514: The employability through practical training because i enjoy more of practical than theory
13/01/24, 2:46 pm - Garima Edoofa: I am delighted to know that you have been looking for the same.


Alright Prudence, basically, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
13/01/24, 2:47 pm - +263 78 906 8514: Yes they will be helping me  in every way they are able to
13/01/24, 2:48 pm - Garima Edoofa: Alright prudence, basically once we complete your counseling session I would give you time to properly discuss about your entire application once again with your family members so that they too could have much better clarity regarding the same. Meanwhile, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
13/01/24, 2:50 pm - +263 78 906 8514: May we shift to another time right now i am preparing to go for lessons
13/01/24, 2:54 pm - Garima Edoofa: Alright prudence, in that case, we will be reconnecting on Monday at 9 AM cat.

15/01/24, 11:56 am - Garima Edoofa: @263773722571 @263772855249 as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
15/01/24, 12:24 pm - +263 77 285 5249: I really understand it becomes very expensive
15/01/24, 12:29 pm - +263 77 372 2571: It'll obviously end up becoming quite expensive I can see
15/01/24, 12:34 pm - Garima Edoofa: Can you please please answer this question specifically?
15/01/24, 12:36 pm - +263 77 372 2571: So maybe with your experience and expertise you can assist us avoid incurring such high expenses
15/01/24, 12:40 pm - Garima Edoofa: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*

Could you please answer this?
15/01/24, 12:42 pm - +263 77 372 2571: At that cost if a student applied to 5 universities he/she would need between $1500-$2250 for applications only
15/01/24, 12:56 pm - Garima Edoofa: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
15/01/24, 12:56 pm - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
15/01/24, 12:56 pm - Garima Edoofa: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
15/01/24, 12:56 pm - Garima Edoofa: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education.

Don’t you think so?
15/01/24, 1:15 pm - +263 77 372 2571: This message was deleted
15/01/24, 1:30 pm - +263 77 372 2571: Yes I think so. But I would also want to know if I would be correct to say the total amount for tuition & program fee would ultimately be $2000-3000+350
15/01/24, 1:39 pm - Garima Edoofa: @263773722571 basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
15/01/24, 1:39 pm - Garima Edoofa: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
15/01/24, 1:53 pm - +263 77 372 2571: Thank you for that clarification. You may lead us to the next item
15/01/24, 1:57 pm - Garima Edoofa: Alright, please.
15/01/24, 1:57 pm - Garima Edoofa: @263773722571 , as we have discussed about the payment policy of the Enrollment fee and other finances of the program as well, so can you share with me what all did you understand about the financial aspect of the program and how Edoofa helps a student arrange and pay his finances all by himself (in 80 to 100 words)?
15/01/24, 2:26 pm - +263 77 372 2571: I hope I got it right... If a student is deemed competent enough after the enrollment check he/she's supposed to pay program fee in 7 days or if circumstances don't permit pay $200 then balance of $150 within 30 days. The tuition amount will be determined after the EWYL credits have been taken into account. Please assist where you think I would have missed it.
15/01/24, 2:28 pm - Garima Edoofa: Let me summarize the financial aspects for you
*Enrollment fee*
The enrollment fee is $350 out of which you need to pay only $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 is to be paid in next 30 days 
 
For all the services and assistance including Applications,SOP,Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection, and sessions etc all you need to pay is $350
 
 
*Cost of education*
The cost of education is reduced from $6000-$8000 to $2000-$3000 per annum which includes Tuition fee,Accommodation,Food,Wifi,Laundry,Library,Gym fee etc!
 
This cost can be further reduced through the earnings from Earn While You Learn program.
15/01/24, 2:29 pm - Garima Edoofa: Yes @263773722571 and I hope that you have understood how it totally depends upon the student to make his/her higher education affordable with the help of the Earn While You Learn Program's Scholarship Credits?
15/01/24, 2:39 pm - +263 77 372 2571: I think I now understand it. For interest's sake, how soon should the tuition fee be paid before a student commences their studies & what's the deadline
15/01/24, 2:51 pm - Garima Edoofa: The enrollment fee is $350 out of which you need to pay only $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 is to be paid in next 30 days.

The tentative dates will be shared with you soon.
15/01/24, 2:58 pm - +263 77 372 2571: Thank you for that info
15/01/24, 3:04 pm - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
15/01/24, 3:04 pm - Garima Edoofa: Let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
15/01/24, 3:08 pm - Garima Edoofa: Well , 
We had also discussed the Acceptance Letter which a student  receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is the stage 4.

*In Step 1:Connect with counselor-* As your counselor, now we are going through the counseling process discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit based Scholarship.                        

*In Step 2:Eligibility Check-* The eligibility check includes the interviews with Academic Board and Test

*Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa-* If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

*Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program-* This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.

We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
15/01/24, 3:13 pm - +263 77 372 2571: Yes please you can go ahead
15/01/24, 3:40 pm - +263 77 372 2571: My apologies, I've just received some visitors & I don't think I'll be able to continue. Can we proceed tomorrow
15/01/24, 3:43 pm - Garima Edoofa: I understand, but I would request you to take out 10 mins from your schedule so that we can finish our today's conuseling session.
15/01/24, 3:44 pm - Garima Edoofa: Step 5: After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities. 

*August 2025 intake, applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from the Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.*

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.

Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.

I hope you are clear with the process?
15/01/24, 3:48 pm - Garima Edoofa: Are we still connected?
15/01/24, 4:56 pm - Garima Edoofa: I was expecting your response, but it seems you are occupied at the moment, so I will have to schedule your session for tomorrow at 9 AM CAT as my working hours are over for the day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above-mentioned time for a smooth conversation*
15/01/24, 5:21 pm - +263 77 372 2571: I'm sorry I'm still entertaining my visitors and I'll do as per your advice as soon as they're gone
15/01/24, 5:23 pm - Garima Edoofa: Alright, @263773722571 , I understand.
16/01/24, 9:19 am - Garima Edoofa: Good Morning @263789068514 @263773722571 @263772855249 , Hope you all are doing well.
16/01/24, 9:20 am - Garima Edoofa: I am here to continue with our session, shall we start?
16/01/24, 9:27 am - +263 77 285 5249: Morning lets start
16/01/24, 9:31 am - +263 77 372 2571: Its ok we can start
16/01/24, 9:41 am - +263 77 372 2571: Morning
16/01/24, 9:52 am - Garima Edoofa: May I know if you have understood till here properly?
16/01/24, 10:36 am - +263 77 372 2571: I think I have understood most of the aspects. I probably would want to know the maximum or total cost before the EWYL is taken into account
16/01/24, 10:44 am - Garima Edoofa: I would want you to go through this message please.
16/01/24, 11:14 am - +263 77 372 2571: I think I now understand it. Enrollment fee is fixed at $350; then cost of education $2000-$3000. So is this the cost of education bracket for a student after EWYL merit? Not less than $2000 but not more than $3000. If you can clarify this for me please
16/01/24, 11:29 am - Garima Edoofa: I would want you to go through this message, please.
16/01/24, 11:45 am - +263 77 372 2571: The way I've just explained above is how I've understood it. I'm focusing on the actual figures, so if I'm wrong you can help me with the correct figs esp. cost of education
16/01/24, 12:13 pm - Garima Edoofa: Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year ( if your annual fee is $2000) which includes the cost of tuition, food, and accommodation*, which means for the monthly family cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
16/01/24, 12:13 pm - Garima Edoofa: I hope you have understood it properly?
16/01/24, 12:23 pm - +263 77 372 2571: I think that answers my question to a great extend. If I may ask, what kind of work merits the highest credit for a student
16/01/24, 12:27 pm - Garima Edoofa: @263773722571 I would like to tell you there is no limit for earning credit, It totally depends on students how much they can earn, we do have some students who have even earned more than $3000 dollars.
16/01/24, 12:32 pm - +263 77 372 2571: Ok I get the point
16/01/24, 12:35 pm - Garima Edoofa: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
16/01/24, 12:35 pm - Garima Edoofa: Mrs.Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)
16/01/24, 12:35 pm - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
16/01/24, 12:36 pm - Garima Edoofa: Please do connect with Mrs. Ruth as she will give you better clarity about the program from a parent perspective.
16/01/24, 12:36 pm - Garima Edoofa: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
16/01/24, 12:36 pm - Garima Edoofa: And for any questions apart from whatever we have explained, I would appreciate it if you refer your family to the FAQ document which has all the answers to most of the queries which generally parents have.
16/01/24, 12:36 pm - Garima Edoofa: Also, have a look at some pictures of the students who came to India recently for their Academic Session.

16/01/24, 12:38 pm - Garima Edoofa: Dear Prudence, 

Your scholarship journey is reaching a crucial juncture. *Wednesday on “17-01-24” at 10:00 AM CAT,* I will meticulously evaluate your application. This session is not just about answering your questions; it includes a vital Eligibility Check Interview.

We strongly recommend parents/guardians join, recognizing that higher education is a family decision. Prepare for a series of interviews, marking a significant phase in finalizing your scholarship application. As your counselor, I wish you the very best. It's been a pleasure guiding you through your career sessions.

If you qualify for the interview, *Senior Career Counselor Mr Sahil would be getting in touch*, we look forward to welcoming you to India. Please be proactive, as everyone's time is valuable. The Senior Counselor and Director will make decisions based on your interview and adhere strictly to the given time. Follow instructions diligently, and if the session is completed within the allotted time, your application will proceed.

Happy Family Discussion!
Stay Blessed!
16/01/24, 12:47 pm - +263 77 372 2571: Its fine thank you so much. I'll try to get in touch with her
16/01/24, 12:52 pm - Garima Edoofa: I would really appreciate that, please.
16/01/24, 1:39 pm - +263 77 372 2571: I had forgotten to tell that you might have a problem to have your session with Prudence anytime before 1pm because she'll be in class.
16/01/24, 1:40 pm - +263 77 372 2571: And they're not allowed to use their phones during lessons
16/01/24, 1:40 pm - Garima Edoofa: In case of Prudence's unavailability, parents must continue the session. Due to the restricted number of slots for interviews and my limited time, it is crucial to promptly conclude your interview, considering the high number of applicants and limited available seats.
