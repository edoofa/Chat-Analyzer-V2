15/01/24, 12:05 pm - +263 71 921 3646: Uhmm growing up I hve only wanted accounting hence I did Accounts and passed that
15/01/24, 12:11 pm - Garima Edoofa: I understand the clarification you're seeking. Let me provide some additional context:

Accounting can be approached in different ways within the context of education. In many countries, including the India, and others, accounting is often offered as a specialization or major within a broader undergraduate program, such as a Bachelor of Commerce (B.Com) or a Bachelor of Business Administration (BBA).

When students pursue a B.Com or a similar business-related degree, they typically have the option to specialize in accounting.
15/01/24, 1:34 pm - +263 71 921 3646: So Accounting is not offered as an individual program!?
15/01/24, 1:43 pm - Garima Edoofa: Yes, exactly, B.Com or a similar business-related degree, they typically have the option to specialize in accounting.
15/01/24, 2:22 pm - +263 71 921 3646: Uhm but why don't you offer Accounting as a separate program
15/01/24, 2:47 pm - Garima Edoofa: As I have informed you in the above message, Accounting is a specialization, and with the help of a bachelor in commerce degree you can further have a specialization in  Accounting.
15/01/24, 3:34 pm - +263 71 921 3646: Ohh If you say so I guess it's perfect that way
15/01/24, 3:44 pm - Garima Edoofa: Since you have understood the course properly.

Can you now tell me, if you are provided with this career option, how do you see yourself 5 years after the completion of this course?
And if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
15/01/24, 5:14 pm - Garima Edoofa: I was expecting your response, but it seems you are occupied at the moment, so I will have to schedule your session for tomorrow at 9 AM CAT as my working hours are over for the day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above-mentioned time for a smooth conversation*

16/01/24, 2:12 pm - +263 71 921 3646: I would be willing to give my 400% to my future as I want to build a successful future for myself n family
16/01/24, 2:25 pm - Garima Edoofa: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
16/01/24, 2:31 pm - +263 71 921 3646: Uhmm I jus like the idea of studying abroad as I see it having many chances of finding jobs abroad too
16/01/24, 3:10 pm - Garima Edoofa: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
16/01/24, 6:28 pm - +263 71 921 3646: Uhmm I'm seeking to help some schools with stationery...and maybe help others too realise their dreams
16/01/24, 7:10 pm - Garima Edoofa: I appreciate your sense of hard work for your community Takura, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?
16/01/24, 7:45 pm - +263 71 921 3646: Yepp I totally agree with you
16/01/24, 8:03 pm - Garima Edoofa: I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you on *tomorrow again at 9:30 AM CAT* to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind.

Have a good night
God Bless You!
16/01/24, 8:04 pm - +263 71 921 3646: Sure Goodnight
16/01/24, 9:28 pm - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
