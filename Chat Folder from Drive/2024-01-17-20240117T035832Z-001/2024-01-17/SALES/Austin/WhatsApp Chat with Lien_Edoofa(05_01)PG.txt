09/01/24, 11:28 am - Pallika Edoofa: Lien, Thank you for sharing this, Let me brief you that, I want to brief you that the criteria before the pandemic was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is *a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it. <This message was edited>

09/01/24, 12:38 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I am sure after seeing all these amazing facts, you will be intrigued to study in India. So can you now tell me, How would studying in India have a positive impact on your career and help you achieve your goals?
09/01/24, 12:47 pm - +263 77 483 7125: Firstly I would be exposed to a different educational system and culture which will broaden my perspective and give me new insights into the world
Secondly Indian universities are well known for their strong focus on research  and innovation which could help me get valuable skills and experience for my future career <This message was edited>
09/01/24, 12:51 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That is amazing, As I can see, you have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead.

*By any chance are you familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship?*
09/01/24, 1:11 pm - +263 77 483 7125: Not really...may you enlighten me
09/01/24, 1:23 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India compared to other global hubs.

In India, international students face an average expense of *$6000-$8000 annually.* While this is very low as compared to the Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc where the cost of education ranges from $15000-$35000 annually, it is still beyond the reach of many.

With the Edoofa Scholarship Program, the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000 per annum* for the students who are found eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility Check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Laundry, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*

09/01/24, 1:29 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Please excuse me for some time as I am heading for my lunch. Let us connect at 2:30 pm CAT for the next part of our session. Let me know if you have any challenge with the schedule. 

Meanwhile you can go through our Social Media pages to learn more about the experiences of Edoofians and the program!

09/01/24, 1:51 pm - +263 77 483 7125: This could be affordable
09/01/24, 2:46 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Thank you for waiting!
09/01/24, 2:46 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Good to know, 
So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians. Looking at this cost of education as well, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits which can help in reducing their fees further.

Do you know how that is done?
09/01/24, 2:51 pm - +263 77 483 7125: How does one earn scholarship credits...I would like to earn them too
09/01/24, 2:57 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Let me tell you how Edoofa helps Edoofians bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the *Earn While You Learn Program*

The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that are equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.The Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies and needs, converting an Individual into a market-ready professional. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
09/01/24, 2:57 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Projects with Brands and Companies: -*
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, such as:
*Africa Global Radio-* The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project and hear from the CEO about the exposures of the Edoofa program.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4DAP24ZuY4&authuser=0
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0
*Skooqs-* This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

*Recruitment Partners:-*
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

*Webinars:-*
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars regularly with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
-Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
-How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi
-How to be industry-ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu
-It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje
-Decoding the science of personal branding by Mr, Simon Maingi
09/01/24, 2:57 pm - Pallika Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field. These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.

*What are your views on the same? Do you think you will be benefiting from the Earn While You Learn Program?*
09/01/24, 3:15 pm - +263 77 483 7125: Well after you enlightened me about the EWYL program I think I will benefit a lot and I will gain a lot of knowledge from the project's I will be assigned to
09/01/24, 3:19 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
09/01/24, 3:19 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Absolutely,
If I have to help you explain how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable compared to Local Universities, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now, if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, bringing the cost further down to $1000 per year including the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month. *This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*

*You can see this even in this scholarship credit certificate where one of our star performers, our Proud Edoodians  Masinire Miriam earned $1965 within a year.* I hope you can now realize the power of the EWYL program to reduce the financial pressure on families.
09/01/24, 3:23 pm - +263 77 483 7125: Yes indeed...so that means that I will be able to give a hand to my parents financially through the credits I earn
09/01/24, 3:31 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Yes, Exactly!
09/01/24, 3:31 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, a few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :

*1. Expert Career Counselling:* We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counsellors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.

*2. Affordability through guaranteed scholarships:* Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off.

*3. Earn While You Learn:* The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing our students for the real world. 

*4.Higher Education Concierge:* A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.*

After going through these facts that make Edoofa different, which one out of the 4 did you feel is the most significant?
09/01/24, 3:58 pm - +263 77 483 7125: Affordability through guaranteed scholarships
09/01/24, 3:59 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Great! 
So now I know you focus more on affordability and maximum exposures
Let me also show you some monthly earnings of students through Earn While You Learn

09/01/24, 4:00 pm - Pallika Edoofa: As you see, there is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it depends upon his/her hard work. However, who will be helping you with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
09/01/24, 4:01 pm - +263 77 483 7125: Oky
09/01/24, 4:05 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Please address this.
09/01/24, 4:22 pm - +263 77 483 7125: The pictures are still downloading
09/01/24, 4:26 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright!
09/01/24, 4:27 pm - Pallika Edoofa: You can address this in the meanwhile
09/01/24, 4:28 pm - +263 77 483 7125: My parents will be helping me with the remaining fee
09/01/24, 4:30 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's completely understandable, I believe you'll be discussing everything with your family after we complete today's session. Also, after our counselling session, I would connect to some of our beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know their experiences and proceedings well.

May I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
09/01/24, 4:31 pm - +263 77 483 7125: They have been support about the whole thing...they are the ones who asked me to give it a try
09/01/24, 4:33 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, as studying Internationally would make your career advance at an even greater pace, as you will be transformed into a professional with a well-paying job, which would help you in uplifting your family there by yourself, and provide a peaceful and hassle-free life to your parents.
09/01/24, 4:34 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *As we move to the last part of the session, let me highlight a few requirements while a student applies alone* 

*1) Application Form* -An online or offline form that asks for your personal details and academic background.

*2) Statement of Purpose-* An essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and your aspirations for your career.

*3) Letter of Recommendation-* from Senior authorities, School Heads or others on why they recommend you to be a right fit for an international university.
Do you know about other requirements?
09/01/24, 4:53 pm - +263 77 483 7125: English proficiency
09/01/24, 4:54 pm - +263 77 483 7125: And also an entrance exam
09/01/24, 5:01 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Also, When a student applies alone for an international University, on average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose costs between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally and act as a major parameter to decide the child’s eligibility. If you apply to 5 Universities, the average costs for the mentioned would be $1350-$1750, *without even receiving a guarantee to be selected*

*Edoofa has identified a solution for this uncertainty and unaffordability.* If a student qualifies after the eligibility check, not only does Edoofa help them draft their statement of purpose but also helps in terms of Visa Documentation Assistance, University Session and selection, Individual mentorship, etc, reducing the costs significantly to $750 which is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
09/01/24, 5:01 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
09/01/24, 5:07 pm - +263 77 483 7125: Yes please
09/01/24, 5:07 pm - Pallika Edoofa: There are 3 phases to the enrollment process.
 
*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation
If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Acceptance Letter. You are supposed to pay the enrollment fee of $350 in 7 days for the scholarship seat reservation and to begin the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2*: Once the students complete Phase 1 they will be starting the Earn While You Learn program session(Each student will have an opportunity to earn scholarship credits that can be used to reduce their fee even before their A-Level result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final A-level results are out and the student has passed the requirement as per Edoofa, then their final university evaluation and Admission will continue. However, if the student wouldn’t meet the requirements as per the university and Edoofa, then the $350 will be refunded to the parent.

The amount of credits earned by the student in phase 2 can be used for the first year’s annual fee itself so that parents are relieved from financial stress paving the way for proper financial planning for higher education.
09/01/24, 5:07 pm - Pallika Edoofa: The enrollment fee is to be paid only if a child is found eligible for the Edoofa Scholarship Program after passing the eligibility check stage, it includes, 

*Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
*Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
*Earn While You Learn Program and training*
*University sessions and selection*
*A guaranteed scholarship seat*
*Visa Documentation Assistance*
*The Foster and Care throughout the course of an Edoofian*
09/01/24, 5:08 pm - Pallika Edoofa: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge due to which parents might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short period of 7 days and for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option wherein if the student is found eligible, instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, *parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days thereby reducing the financial pressure.*
09/01/24, 9:41 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
09/01/24, 9:44 pm - +263 77 483 7125: Noted
10/01/24, 9:09 am - Pallika Edoofa: Good Morning,

*“If there is no struggle, there is no progress.” —Frederick Douglass*

On a positive note, I am here to begin our session
Are you ready?
10/01/24, 9:43 am - +263 77 483 7125: Greetings to you all

Yes we may begin
10/01/24, 9:53 am - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Lien!
10/01/24, 9:53 am - Pallika Edoofa: I hope that you are doing well
10/01/24, 9:53 am - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
10/01/24, 9:57 am - +263 77 483 7125: We have done stage one and two
10/01/24, 10:04 am - Pallika Edoofa: Well Lien,
We also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.

*Step 1:Connect with a counsellor-* As your counsellor, now we are going through the counselling process discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Edoofa Scholarship.                        

*Step 2:Eligibility Check-* The eligibility check includes the interviews with the Academic Board and Scholarship Test.

*Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa-* If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter.

*Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program-* This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.

We are left with steps 5 and 6.
So shall I explain them to you?
10/01/24, 10:07 am - +263 77 483 7125: Yes you may
10/01/24, 10:09 am - Pallika Edoofa: Excellect, so let me now guide you through step 5&6
10/01/24, 10:09 am - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 5:* After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors. They will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. will be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by paying the registration fee within a few weeks.

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education and the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).
10/01/24, 10:09 am - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 6:* Once you are done with the registration fee payment, you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.
 
I hope you are clear with the process.
10/01/24, 10:13 am - +263 77 483 7125: Yes I understood
10/01/24, 10:14 am - Pallika Edoofa: Lien, we have come to the end of your counselling session.

11/01/24, 12:28 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I appreciate the willingness of your family to invest in your career.
11/01/24, 12:28 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Lien, Before we move to the Eligibility Procedures, can you tell me?

1. What is the name of the course that you would be studying through the Edoofa Program?

2. In which country will you be studying through the Edoofa program?

3. What is the average cost of studies in India without a scholarship?

4. What is the annual fee you will pay if found eligible for the program?

5. What is the enrollment fee of the Edoofa Program and in how many days is it paid if you are found eligible?

6. Please elaborate on your understanding of the Earn While You Learn program in 75-100 words.

7. After receiving your offer letter from the University, you will have to pay your registration fee to finalize your university selection and reserve your scholarship seat in a particular university, this registration fee will be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?
11/01/24, 12:48 pm - +263 77 483 7125: 1) BBA-IT
2) India
3) $1350_$1750
4) $2000-$3000 per year
5) part fee of $200 in a week and the remainder of $150 can be paid in the next 30 days
6) The EWYL program is so rogeam that reduces idleness in students as they will be given some projects which they are supposed to complete. After a student completes those projects they are then given some credits
Those credits will then reduce costs for the student since it will be used to cover tuition fees
7) Yes that's clear for me
11/01/24, 12:52 pm - Pallika Edoofa: 3) The average cost of education in India is $6000-$8000
11/01/24, 12:56 pm - +263 77 483 7125: Oky thank you for the clarification
11/01/24, 1:10 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Lien, I'd like to go over the assessment of your application. And I would like to share with you that BBA IT is indeed a NISCHE course offered in specific colleges or universities, it's crucial to highlight that the associated scholarship amount, ranging from 2700 to 3700 dollars per year, might not align with your financial requirements. Considering our earlier conversations, the BCA course emerges as a more viable option for you, and fortunately, you meet all the eligibility criteria for it.

11/01/24, 2:21 pm - +263 77 483 7125: I am with my dad right now...can he send a voice note replying on the above ...
11/01/24, 2:22 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Sure
11/01/24, 2:30 pm - +263 77 483 7125: <Media omitted>
11/01/24, 2:33 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I understand that, Dear Parent!
11/01/24, 2:33 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Our Senior Academician was in Zimbabwe for 4 months last year and let me highlight the importance of this opportunity for Zimbabwean students. I want you to think about this situation, where you are studying at UZ. The Tuition fee at UZ ranges from $1000-$1200 per annum with hikes most of the years. The living expenses in Zimbabwe are much more costly than in India. Even the staple diet sadza costs $1 per meal. So you have to spend around $3 per or more per day for meals. A taxi ride for a short distance costs $1, Wi-Fi costs $120 per month, the living rents are high with hikes and the unemployment rates are increasing. Many students work at petrol pumps, markets, selling SIM cards etc after graduation. You might have observed this. All in all, students studying in Zimbabwe have informed us they have to meet an expense of about $3000 or more per annum.
11/01/24, 2:33 pm - Pallika Edoofa: At the same time, Edoofians are studying here in India at a cost much less than that of Zimbabwe and even self-sponsoring their education through the Earn While You Learn Program. We also ensure they develop employability skills so that they are job-ready by the time they graduate. I believe you are looking forward to such an opportunity for your child’s career, aren't you?
11/01/24, 2:37 pm - +263 77 483 7125: Yes I am looking forward to such an opportunity for my child and you have opened my eyes on some of the facts I had not considered...I will try by all means to meet the due date of payment
11/01/24, 2:43 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Dear Parent!
 If we begin the eligibility check stage of your child today, it would be of 1-2 days after which the results will be out which means if your child qualifies for the Edoofa Scholarship, the due date for the first part of the enrollment fee ($200)will fall on the next week of January. Are you confident and comfortable with the timeframe?
11/01/24, 2:46 pm - +263 77 483 7125: Yah I will try to meet the timeline
11/01/24, 2:48 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Thank you for the acknowledgement, dear parent!
It has been duly noted and we appreciate your support for your child's career
11/01/24, 2:52 pm - +263 77 483 7125: Thank you ma'am...I am signing out
11/01/24, 2:56 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Dear Parent,
I acknowledge your concern, and I understand that attempting this could risk missing out on a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for your child.

How are you doing?
13/01/24, 5:02 pm - +263 77 483 7125: I am doing good
13/01/24, 5:02 pm - +263 77 483 7125: Unfortunately my parents are not available right now they have some errands they are still attending
13/01/24, 5:09 pm - Austin: You are most welcome,Lien. we are really glad that you qualified for the Edoofa Scholarship Program. We look forward to you as a proud Edoofian fulfilling your career goals through this opportunity.
13/01/24, 5:09 pm - Austin: Good to know!
13/01/24, 5:09 pm - Austin: I do understand and when will they be available?
13/01/24, 5:18 pm - +263 77 483 7125: I am not so sure but I think they will be home at 7
13/01/24, 5:19 pm - Austin: Noted Lien, so do you have any questions for me regarding your Acceptance Letter?
13/01/24, 5:25 pm - +263 77 483 7125: Oky may you please clarify on this note...
My annual fee will range from $1200_$1800 annually am I right and if yes is the fee being catered for by my parents and my credits from EWYL
13/01/24, 5:28 pm - Austin: That is right, Lien
This reduced cost of education is supposed to be catered by your parents and can be further reduced through the EWYL program
13/01/24, 5:28 pm - Austin: The cost can be paid in two equal installments, each instalment before a semester. There are two semesters in a year
13/01/24, 5:29 pm - +263 77 483 7125: Oky the other question is who will cater for my travelling expenses from Zimbabwe...
13/01/24, 5:39 pm - Austin: If you understand the concept of International Education, the finances that play a major role is not flight tickets because it is taken a limited number of times, maybe twice or once, because international students don't often travel back to their country.

They look forward to settling down and making sure education is not hampered.So they learn and do internships at breaks. But still, students can definitely visit their family during holidays and spend time with them.

But I personally have seen that students don't often travel,so considering these the traveling fee
*is to be catered by the student* which is mostly a one-time investment.
13/01/24, 5:44 pm - +263 77 483 7125: I mean the traveling expence for me to go there on the intake
13/01/24, 5:45 pm - Austin: Yes please, it is supposed to be catered by your family
13/01/24, 5:46 pm - +263 77 483 7125: Oky thank you for the clarification
13/01/24, 5:48 pm - Austin: You are welcome, what else would you like to ask  me please?
16/01/24, 9:36 am - Austin: Good Day to you all!
How are you doing?
16/01/24, 9:36 am - +263 77 483 7125: Good day
16/01/24, 9:50 am - Austin: Good to hear from you!
16/01/24, 9:50 am - Austin: Did you manage to connect to any of our beneficiaries or their parents from your country to learn their experiences through the Edoofa Scholarship program?
16/01/24, 10:08 am - +263 77 483 7125: Yes I did
16/01/24, 10:09 am - +263 77 483 7125: But after connecting with someone there I had some questions on the EWYL program whether you will honestly give us the credit
16/01/24, 10:33 am - Austin: Good to know!
