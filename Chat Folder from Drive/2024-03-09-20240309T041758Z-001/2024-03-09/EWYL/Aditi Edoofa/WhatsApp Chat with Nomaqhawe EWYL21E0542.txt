2/2/24, 2:15 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Good Afternoon, Nomaqhawe!

I understand that circumstances led you to delay your higher education journey as of last year, after taking a significant step towards building your future through us and I am sure that you must have been in touch with our Admissions team to figure out the best available solutions for you. Since then, Edoofa has been on a journey of innovation, creating new opportunities for learning and growth for students like you!

While I was going through your conversation, It reminded me of how I started my education journey full of questions and aspirations, and therefore I wanted to check in and have a conversation about how you are doing currently. 
May I know how are you planning to move your journey ahead?🚀
7/2/24, 12:48 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Hello Nomaqhawe!
Hope you are doing well.

I was expecting a response from your side. <This message was edited>

While we were having multiple conversations with our students in the past few days for the meet & greet event, we figured that there is a slight confusion in the invitation dates. Hence, I wanted to quickly reach out and ensure that the same is not the case with yo*.

- As per the invitation, *you* are supposed to attend the event along with your parents on *19th of February* which is Mond*y.
 
- If you are recommending any of *your friends (Non Edoofians)* along with their parents to attend the event, as per their choice, the seminar is scheduled for *18th of February (8am/1pm) or 19th February(1pm)*. They should carry a physical copy of their admit cards to enter the event. <This message was edited>
17/2/24, 10:41 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Please ensure that you are present at the venue 30 minutes earlier and are dressed appropriately.

Cannot wait to see you there on Monday! Hope you're excited too! 😃🕺🏻

Your perspective is crucial, and I also encourage you to discuss the event with your parents and gather their feedback. <This message was edited>
