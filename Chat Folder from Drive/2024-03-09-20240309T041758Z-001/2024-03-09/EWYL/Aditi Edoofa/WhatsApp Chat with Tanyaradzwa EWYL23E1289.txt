5/3/24, 2:19 PM - Aditi Edoofa: So Tanyaradzwa, I would like to begin this journey by knowing you beyond the _Statement of Purpose._ Can you share with me what are your long-term goals and how do you think this EWYL Program will help you in achieving them?
5/3/24, 2:32 PM - +263 78 583 1530: My long term goal is to be a successful accountant. I need to pursue on my bachelor's degree in accounting and need some accounting experience .

Yes the EWYL is just a piece of a my puzzle to be chartered accountant and also a business woman .I can also gain knowledge and skills to pass some of my exams and to be a successful chartered accountant
5/3/24, 2:39 PM - Aditi Edoofa: It's fantastic to hear about your long-term goal of becoming a successful accountant. Pursuing a bachelor's degree in accounting and gaining relevant experience in the field are crucial steps toward achieving that goal.

It's great that you see the EWYL program as a valuable piece of the puzzle in your journey to becoming a chartered accountant and a businesswoman. The program can offer you not only practical knowledge and skills but also support in passing exams and advancing in your career.

Keep your focus on your aspirations, and continue to leverage opportunities like the EWYL program to enhance your skills and knowledge. With dedication and determination, you're well on your way to achieving success in your chosen field.
5/3/24, 2:39 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
5/3/24, 2:41 PM - +263 78 583 1530: Not quite
5/3/24, 2:46 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
5/3/24, 2:46 PM - Aditi Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
5/3/24, 2:53 PM - +263 78 583 1530: Noted

Yes
8/3/24, 1:37 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
8/3/24, 1:38 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
8/3/24, 1:39 PM - +27 82 605 7855: Yes
8/3/24, 1:41 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
8/3/24, 1:41 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 10 minutes should be enough.

8/3/24, 2:02 PM - +27 82 605 7855: Yes ,surely I hope so
8/3/24, 2:03 PM - Aditi Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
