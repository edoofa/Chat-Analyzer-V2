22/1/24, 1:40 PM - +263 78 044 7407: Yes I am
22/1/24, 1:42 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Well, I can see that there are some other people who have joined the group besides you. May I learn a little about each of them? I would appreciate it if we could engage in a quick conversation and get to know each other a bit.

22/1/24, 1:45 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I extend a warm welcome to them for the exciting and incredible EWYL journey.

22/1/24, 1:49 PM - Aditi Edoofa: It's okay, I understand.
22/1/24, 1:50 PM - +263 78 044 7407: Thank you
22/1/24, 1:52 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I would like to begin this journey by knowing you beyond the _Statement of Purpose._ Can you share with me what are your long-term goals and how do you think this EWYL Program will help you in achieving them?
22/1/24, 1:54 PM - +263 78 044 7407: I would like to study and become an accomplished computer science engineer and be able to one day start my own software company and employ my fellow youth.
I believe the EWYL program can help me acquire the skillset and experience I need in the future

Becoming a computer science engineer and eventually starting your own software company to empower fellow youth is a commendable vision. The EWYL program indeed offers valuable opportunities for skill development and gaining practical experience, which will undoubtedly contribute to your journey toward achieving this goal.
22/1/24, 1:59 PM - +263 77 364 1505: Thank you
22/1/24, 1:59 PM - +263 78 044 7407: This message was deleted
22/1/24, 1:59 PM - +263 78 044 7407: I agree
22/1/24, 2:00 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
22/1/24, 2:01 PM - +263 78 044 7407: No I do not know what they are
22/1/24, 2:02 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
22/1/24, 2:02 PM - Aditi Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
22/1/24, 2:04 PM - +263 78 044 7407: Noted
Thank you
22/1/24, 2:04 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skillset through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
22/1/24, 2:08 PM - +263 78 044 7407: Thank you for the introductions
22/1/24, 2:09 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
22/1/24, 2:10 PM - +263 78 044 7407: It sounds very interesting
22/1/24, 2:12 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 10 minutes should be enough.

22/1/24, 2:25 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Did you notice the _Edoofa Hall of Inspiration_? I am sure you would one day want yourself to be celebrated in this section, the entire Student community reads this newsletter and it's a great deal to be mentioned by the founder himself, isn't it?
22/1/24, 2:27 PM - +263 78 044 7407: It really is
22/1/24, 2:27 PM - Aditi Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound?
22/1/24, 2:31 PM - Aditi Edoofa: So we are wrapping up for today and look forward to connecting tomorrow with the same enthusiasm.🌺

3. Study the website of the company
4. Check the various social media pages of the company
5. Understanding and studying background of the founder and core members

Hope you are well. 

So are you ready for today's session?🚀

30/1/24, 1:38 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
30/1/24, 1:38 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, so very quickly-can you summarize whatever you learned in the audio for me? Just so we’re on the same page about it.
30/1/24, 1:41 PM - +263 78 044 7407: The term community building refers to the process of establishing and strengthening connections, relationships, and shared identities among individuals with a particular group or community. This involves creating a supportive and inclusive environment where individuals feel a sense of belonging and are able to collaborate, communicate, and work towards common goals. The goal of the community building is to foster a positive and cohesive community that promotes social interaction and participation in a shared sense of responsibility and ownership towards achieving collective success. The shared belief is the core of our second project, which is community building. The primary outcome of this project is for students to develop networking and persuasion skills and learn how to leverage social media to offer African students an opportunity to join Edoofians educational ecosystem and acquire international education that prepares them for the future. By reaching out to personal and extended networks, students will identify motivated youths who are looking to create great careers and direct them towards this opportunity. This project also encourages students to have a mindset of identifying opportunities and sharing them openly to create an impact in the lives of others. To successfully complete this project, students are required to reach out to African students who have recently graduated from senior secondary schools, completed their secondary education, or are currently in the final year of secondary education. As a member of Team EDOOFA, students will be expected to use their networking and persuasion skills to refer the students to the program and help the organization grow. Throughout the project, EDOOFA will provide guidance and support to ensure that the students are successful in their efforts. The reference generation project for EDOOFA provides students with the opportunity to earn scholarship credits by referring their personal and extended networks to the EDOOFA program.
30/1/24, 1:42 PM - Aditi Edoofa: That’s awesome, I’m confident that if you continue to pay attention to the information shared and then respond accordingly, we will make a great team. Now, here are 2 things I’d like to briefly remind you of from the Community Building Project.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
30/1/24, 2:10 PM - Aditi Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)

Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
30/1/24, 2:10 PM - Aditi Edoofa: ADD MENTOR:

Make sure that before you start interacting with the participants in the group that you created for the community-building project, YOU ADD ME.

The purpose of doing this is that:
- I will be able to track your progress and guide you through learning the networking skill
- I will be able to see the concerns raised by students and we can discuss them accordingly.
- I will be able to see whether the right information has been shared with all the students

30/1/24, 2:12 PM - +263 78 044 7407: Noted
30/1/24, 2:13 PM - Aditi Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
30/1/24, 2:13 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I am ____________, a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in Zimbabwe, where tuition fees range from ZWL 650,000 to ZWL 750,000 per term. When considering the yearly cost, including food and accommodation, it exceeds $2,100 in our beloved Zimbabwe.

Today, the internet is a necessity, and I truly realized its importance when preparing for my journey to India. We are all well aware of the expenses we have to bear just to access subpar internet services. During my school days, I used to spend a minimum of $35-$40 a month to ensure I had sufficient internet, which added up to around $450-$500 annually. It's remarkable to discover that in India, students value their educational infrastructure so much that they can access a necessity like the internet for around $40 for the entire year.

Conversely, when speaking to my seniors in Zimbabwe, I realized that I might have to compromise on my choice of course due to limited available seats. Furthermore, many seniors are struggling with unemployment after graduating in Zimbabwe.

I had a strong desire to support my family through part-time employment during my course, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn between $50 and $100 per month throughout the course.

While pursuing tertiary education in India is more affordable than universities in Zimbabwe, it comes with its own challenges. I diligently followed the 5'S, which played a crucial role in helping me qualify for this scholarship. I urge you to go through these Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors will ask you questions based on the information in the flyer I have attached

Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

31/1/24, 2:05 PM - +263 78 044 7407: This project gives students an opportunity to make their teachers proud by telling them how lucky they are to qualify for the EDOOFA  program. As part of this project I will reach out to local schools and headmasters in my region and inform them about the EDOOFA  program. So initially what I can do is I can make a list of all the highest secondary schools in my local area. I can start with my own school, connect with the principal of your school and you can tell them maybe over whatsapp or a call about why I joined EDOOFA in the first place. I can later tell them about how I have planned my future and then share the details about the program. After this I can  ask them if I would like to set up an online meeting with the EDOOFA program director where both of them can explore synergies. After this I can then share the contact details of the principal with my EWYL mentor in the format that shall be provided to me. As I know that in this project I  have to reach out to schools and arrange a meeting between the school headmaster and the EDOOFA program director.

6/2/24, 1:45 PM - +263 78 044 7407: That is of great assistance
6/2/24, 1:49 PM - Aditi Edoofa: When the school’s per-term fees are less than $100, we do not get a school call done by Edoofa's Program Director.
The reason behind this is that it is very much doubt that the students from this school will or will not be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education.
So in such a case, we insist that students to forms a WhatsApp where they add me, Mr. Jyotishman, Ms. Deepali, Mr. Abhinav, and the Headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact from that school. After forming the group they:
1) either ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to specifically add those prospective students who will be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education. After they add, then tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
or
2)ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to share those prospective students' contact details with you, so that you can add them and then educate them about Edoofa. After that, tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them

6/2/24, 2:24 PM - +263 78 044 7407: Yes I will do all those things ma'am with due diligence
6/2/24, 2:24 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Great!

6/2/24, 2:28 PM - Aditi Edoofa: You look lovely, Claire!
6/2/24, 2:29 PM - Aditi Edoofa: So here are a few more important points that I would like to share with you regarding the projects.
There is no deadline for the project.
There is no order in which you have to do the project.
There is no limit on how much you have to do a project.
There is no limit to the number of scholarship credits one can earn through projects.
It's simple, the *more you work on it, the more scholarship credits you earn.*
Moreover, it is important *that you make steady progress every day*.
6/2/24, 2:29 PM - +263 78 044 7407: Thank you miss Aditi
6/2/24, 2:29 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Claire, this concludes our initial orientation.

6/2/24, 2:30 PM - +263 78 044 7407: Ok I understand
6/2/24, 2:30 PM - +263 78 044 7407: Ok thank you ma'am

16/2/24, 5:32 PM - Aditi Edoofa: While we were having multiple conversations with our students in the past few days for the meet & greet event, we figured that there is a slight confusion in the invitation dates.

- If you are recommending any of your friends(Non Edoofians) along with their parents to attend the event, as per their choice, the seminar is scheduled for 18th of February(8am/1pm) or 19th  February(1pm). They should carry a physical copy of their admit cards to enter the event.
