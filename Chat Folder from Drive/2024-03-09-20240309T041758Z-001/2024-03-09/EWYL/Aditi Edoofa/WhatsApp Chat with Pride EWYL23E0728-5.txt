I wanted to share some exciting news with all of you. As you may have noticed, my schedule has been quite packed lately due to work commitments. The reason behind this is something truly special – our team has organized a three-day long industrial visit called *SLICE CON' 24* for our Indian Edoofians! 🚀

During this event, *we are fortunate to have the Co-founders and CEOs of prominent brands* who will be present and sharing their invaluable experiences in one-on-one sessions. Yes, you read that right – they will be there live, right in front of us! What's even more thrilling is that a few of *our students are presenting a presentation directly to these CEOs*, showcasing why Africa, your homeland, is the best market for their products. 🤝
6/1/24, 1:29 PM - Aditi Edoofa: While I am filled with excitement for this event, please note that due to my involvement in the visit on the *8th, 9th, and 10th of January*, our regular sessions won't be taking place on these days.

12/2/24, 8:23 AM - Aditi Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
12/2/24, 8:23 AM - Aditi Edoofa: I am ____________, a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in Zimbabwe, where tuition fees range from ZWL 650,000 to ZWL 750,000 per term. When considering the yearly cost, including food and accommodation, it exceeds $2,100 in our beloved Zimbabwe.

Today, the internet is a necessity, and I truly realized its importance when preparing for my journey to India. We are all well aware of the expenses we have to bear just to access subpar internet services. During my school days, I used to spend a minimum of $35-$40 a month to ensure I had sufficient internet, which added up to around $450-$500 annually. It's remarkable to discover that in India, students value their educational infrastructure so much that they can access a necessity like the internet for around $40 for the entire year.

Conversely, when speaking to my seniors in Zimbabwe, I realized that I might have to compromise on my choice of course due to limited available seats. Furthermore, many seniors are struggling with unemployment after graduating in Zimbabwe.

I had a strong desire to support my family through part-time employment during my course, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn between $50 and $100 per month throughout the course.

While pursuing tertiary education in India is more affordable than universities in Zimbabwe, it comes with its own challenges. I diligently followed the 5'S, which played a crucial role in helping me qualify for this scholarship. I urge you to go through these Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors will ask you questions based on the information in the flyer I have attached

Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

Now, to help the students reduce the financial burden of food and accommodation, Edoofa has its own Earn While You Learn Program, which helps the students to learn skills and earn money in the form of scholarship credits to reduce their expenses.🙌
12/2/24, 8:26 AM - Aditi Edoofa: _Over the past 5 years, after counseling tens of thousands of students, Edoofa has gone in-depth in understanding the problems that students face. The Edoofa Program removes every obstacle standing between your student and his/her higher education dreams. Edoofa as an organization wants to make higher education affordable for every student studying in your school. Coupled with the Earn While You Learn Program, Edoofa wants to make your students employable who are equipped with all the skills that today’s industry needs, so that when a student from your school would return to your country, he/she has got more opportunities to chase him/her as compared to peers and so that you can add value to your school as well as country’s development/growth._
12/2/24, 8:26 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, they have more than 1500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. Edoofa has been associated with more than *100 schools*. This includes collaboration with more than _250 Headmasters, Chairman SDC, and Educationists_ who have been part of our long partnership benefitting the students to accomplish their international dream of studying in India.

Their associate partner, *Mr. Shorwi Kawadza* is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of *Hartzell High School*. Hartzell High School, Mutare has collaborated with them for the past *Four Years* from which more than _80 students_ have enrolled and arrived in India already.
12/2/24, 8:26 AM - Aditi Edoofa: The Child of the *DEO, Manicaland* Sir Abson Mapfumo is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. 
_*United College of Education*_, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and _Respected Sir Adam Luthuli_ has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. 


Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, _*Headmaster of Chibuwe High*_, the son of Ms. Christina Rockson, _The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School_, South Africa, and the child of Mrs. Aleta Makomeke, _DEO at Masvingo province_ are Edoofians and they have many more success stories from _St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, *Advent Hope Academy*, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High_, etc.
12/2/24, 8:26 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Along with this, schools can be benefited in the following way:
1. Free Educational Counseling for Parents of ‘A-Level’/SHS Students looking to Study Abroad.
2. Quality Career Guidance Program for Learners to become eligible for 50-100 percent Scholarship on Tuition Fees in Degree Programs in Top Indian Universities.
3. Opportunities for Collaboration for implementing the best practices of the Indian Education System in progressive African Schools.
4. Facilitating your school-nominated teachers/academicians who have accomplished a Master's degree and want to pursue a higher academic qualification(PHD.)(Part-Time) on a 50-100 percent Scholarship.
12/2/24, 8:26 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Also, When the school’s per-term fees are less than $100, we do not get a school call done by Edoofa's Program Director.
The reason behind this is that it is very much doubt that the students from this school will or will not be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education.
So in such a case, we insist that students to forms a WhatsApp where they add me, Mr. Jyotishman, Ms. Deepali, Mr. Abhinav, and the Headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact from that school. After forming the group they:
1) either ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to specifically add those prospective students who will be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education. After they add, then tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
or
2)ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to share those prospective students' contact details with you, so that you can add them and then educate them about Edoofa. After that, tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them <This message was edited>

21/2/24, 11:11 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Good Morning Pride!
Hope you are well.

I am looking forward for your response on my above message.
21/2/24, 11:30 AM - +263 78 104 6384: Good morning
21/2/24, 11:33 AM - +263 78 104 6384: For me it's an overwhelming event because I got a chance to me meet the founder and get the insights of the edoofa program in person. I thought maybe I would see few people pitching up in the program but I got surprised .I met a lot of people including some whom I learnt with in high school and met some who are yet to do a course like mine in the university.
21/2/24, 11:36 AM - +263 78 104 6384: We watched a short video that made me wish I could go to work India as soon as possible. And I loved was that our parents got a chance to watch it with us. They got to know how the edoofa program was . Their doubts were cleared up. And understood that the EWYL program can help me self supply my fees when I get over there
21/2/24, 11:38 AM - +263 78 104 6384: We wrote an ESAT . And I won't lie I was scared. I was nervous but then I saw people who were around were just like a student aspiring to study abroad wanting to be lawyers and engineers . I felt relieved . The test was a bit tricky because it wasn't something that I expected 😅.
21/2/24, 3:05 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I'm thrilled to hear about your experience at the event! Meeting the founder and gaining firsthand insights into the Edoofa program must have been truly remarkable. It's amazing that the turnout exceeded your expectations and that you had the chance to reconnect with old friends and meet new ones.

Watching the video must have been inspiring, especially knowing that your parents were able to see it too and gain a better understanding of the program. It's great that their doubts were cleared, and they now see the potential for the EWYL program to support your education financially.

As for the ESAT, it's completely normal to feel nervous, but it sounds like you handled it well, especially after seeing others in a similar situation. Tricky tests can be challenging, but they also provide an opportunity to showcase your problem-solving skills.

Overall, it sounds like you had a fulfilling and memorable experience at the event. Thank you for sharing it with me!
21/2/24, 3:24 PM - +263 78 104 6384: You are welcome
21/2/24, 3:24 PM - +263 78 104 6384: But I still have a problem with something
21/2/24, 3:27 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Can you please elaborate on the issue so that I can help you out.
21/2/24, 3:29 PM - +263 78 104 6384: So I do have people who have gone filled in the offline form. What should I do next
22/2/24, 8:19 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Good Morning Pride!
