17/2/24, 9:02 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Good Morning Lenon!

While we were having multiple conversations with our students in the past few days for the meet & greet event, we figured that there is a slight confusion in the invitation dates. Hence, I wanted to quickly reach out and ensure that the same is not the case with you.

- As per the invitation, *you* are supposed to attend the event along with your parents on *19th of February* which is Monday.
 
- If you are recommending any of *your friends (Non Edoofians)* along with their parents to attend the event, as per their choice, the seminar is scheduled for *18th of February (8am/1pm) or 19th February(1pm)*. They should carry a physical copy of their admit cards to enter the event.
17/2/24, 9:02 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Please ensure that you are present at the venue 30 minutes earlier and are dressed appropriately.
Don't forget to carry your admit card!

Hope you are well.

I am looking forward to your response to my above message.

Team Edoofa experienced a whirlwind over the past three days, with activities bustling in both India and Harare for the Meet and Greet '24 event. After a brief moment to collect ourselves, we're ready to return to our original schedule and move forward in our journey. 
*Our session will commence today at 8:30 AM.*
22/2/24, 8:28 AM - Aditi Edoofa: So let's begin with today's session🚀

22/2/24, 2:10 PM - +263 77 399 7978: I see us dealing with two universities here...Desh Bagat & Galgotias universities.

26/2/24, 9:39 AM - Aditi Edoofa: We are concluding today's session. We will reconvene tomorrow for our session.🚀
26/2/24, 10:50 AM - Aditi Edoofa: I've noticed that you've left my message on "Seen" without responding.
Your responsibility as a mentee includes actively engaging in conversations, seeking guidance when needed, and keeping me updated on your progress. Ignoring messages, even unintentionally, can hinder our ability to work together effectively and achieve your goals.
27/2/24, 9:57 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Good Morning Lenon!
Hope you are well.

Please excuse me as I was unable to take your session as it coincided with a team meeting. I apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused. Thank you for your understanding.
28/2/24, 7:57 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Good Morning Lenon!
Hope you are well.

During my discussion with Mr. Angad today, I realized the need for more efficient and effective sessions with my students to expedite our progress.

In light of this, I have decided to reschedule our sessions to Monday through Friday from 1:30 PM to 3:00 PM. This schedule change will ensure more productive sessions, and I look forward to seeing you today at the new time!
28/2/24, 8:34 AM - +263 77 399 7978: Sorry , the boy is today travelling back home from Harare....I think he will contact you as soon as he completes his journey. I hope this will not inconvenience your programs.
28/2/24, 3:11 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, I understand. Thank you for letting me know.
29/2/24, 1:34 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Good Afternoon!☀️
Hope you are well.

Are you ready for the session?🚀
29/2/24, 1:48 PM - +263 78 221 4255: Today I am ready and available
29/2/24, 2:01 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
29/2/24, 2:02 PM - Aditi Edoofa: So, I would like to begin this journey by knowing you beyond the _Statement of Purpose._ Can you share with me what are your long-term goals and how do you think this EWYL Program will help you in achieving them?
29/2/24, 2:17 PM - +263 78 221 4255: In the long term, I look forward to spearheading new advances in improving the effeciency of electrical systems overally to reduce the cost of electricity supply in households and also reduce strain on national and international power supply grids. I think Edoofa will go a long way in helping me to achieve this goal by allowing me to experience, first hand, how other nations, especially large ones like india, are dealing and coping with the power crisis overally around the world.
29/2/24, 2:26 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Your long-term goal of spearheading advancements to enhance the efficiency of electrical systems and reduce the cost of electricity supply is both ambitious and impactful.

Participating in the Edoofa program will indeed provide valuable opportunities for firsthand experience and learning, especially from nations like India, which face similar challenges with power supply and management. Experiencing different approaches and strategies used in various parts of the world will undoubtedly broaden your understanding and perspective, equipping you with the knowledge and insights needed to make meaningful contributions towards your goal.

Your dedication to addressing global issues such as the power crisis is commendable, and I am confident that with the experiences and skills gained through the Edoofa program.
29/2/24, 2:27 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
29/2/24, 2:31 PM - +263 78 221 4255: Please remind me of the same
29/2/24, 2:48 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
29/2/24, 2:48 PM - Aditi Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
29/2/24, 3:11 PM - Aditi Edoofa: The session time has concluded for now, we will meet tomorrow for our session at the same time, so make sure you are on time.⌛
29/2/24, 3:15 PM - +263 78 221 4255: Duly noted
1/3/24, 1:40 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Happy New Month🌸!
Hope you are doing well.

So are you ready for today's session?🚀
1/3/24, 2:39 PM - +263 78 221 4255: Sorry for the delay. I am ready now
1/3/24, 2:49 PM - Aditi Edoofa: @263782214255 May I know why you are late for the session?
1/3/24, 3:06 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Today's session concludes here. 
Please note that there are no sessions scheduled for Saturday and Sunday.
 Our next session will take place on Monday. 
I wish you a wonderful weekend ahead!🌺
5/3/24, 1:39 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Good afternoon!
Hope you are well.

Are you ready for the session?🚀
5/3/24, 1:41 PM - +263 78 221 4255: Yes
5/3/24, 1:51 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skillset through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
5/3/24, 1:52 PM - +263 78 221 4255: Noted
5/3/24, 2:02 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
5/3/24, 2:03 PM - +263 78 221 4255: Very interesting. Carry on
5/3/24, 2:11 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 10 minutes should be enough.

5/3/24, 2:12 PM - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
5/3/24, 2:25 PM - +263 78 221 4255: I have finished reading the newsletters
5/3/24, 2:29 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Great, Did you notice the _Edoofa Hall of Inspiration_? I am sure you would one day want yourself to be celebrated in this section, the entire Student community reads this newsletter and it's a great deal to be mentioned by the founder himself, isn't it?
5/3/24, 2:31 PM - +263 78 221 4255: It is. And I am confident that they will soon be reading about me in that section as well. However, this was not my favorite part of the newsletters... I especially liked the inspirational quotes at the beginning.
5/3/24, 2:37 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Ohh that's nice!
5/3/24, 2:38 PM - Aditi Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound?
5/3/24, 2:42 PM - +263 78 221 4255: That sounds good to me. Thank you
5/3/24, 2:46 PM - Aditi Edoofa: We’re ready to begin your EWYL program now, and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you.

7/3/24, 1:35 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Good afternoon on this beautiful day!
Hope you are well.

Are you ready for today's session?🚀
7/3/24, 1:39 PM - +263 78 221 4255: Ready
7/3/24, 1:46 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
7/3/24, 1:46 PM - Aditi Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
7/3/24, 1:46 PM - Aditi Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)

Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
7/3/24, 1:46 PM - Aditi Edoofa: *ADD MENTOR:*

Make sure that before you start interacting with the participants in the group that you created for the community-building project, YOU ADD ME.

The purpose of doing this is that:
- I will be able to track your progress and guide you through learning the networking skill
- I will be able to see the concerns raised by students and we can discuss them accordingly.
- I will be able to see whether the right information has been shared with all the students

7/3/24, 1:46 PM - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
7/3/24, 2:02 PM - +263 78 221 4255: Understood. Please continue
7/3/24, 2:10 PM - Aditi Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
7/3/24, 2:10 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I am ____________, a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in Zimbabwe, where tuition fees range from ZWL 650,000 to ZWL 750,000 per term. When considering the yearly cost, including food and accommodation, it exceeds $2,100 in our beloved Zimbabwe.

Today, the internet is a necessity, and I truly realized its importance when preparing for my journey to India. We are all well aware of the expenses we have to bear just to access subpar internet services. During my school days, I used to spend a minimum of $35-$40 a month to ensure I had sufficient internet, which added up to around $450-$500 annually. It's remarkable to discover that in India, students value their educational infrastructure so much that they can access a necessity like the internet for around $40 for the entire year.

Conversely, when speaking to my seniors in Zimbabwe, I realized that I might have to compromise on my choice of course due to limited available seats. Furthermore, many seniors are struggling with unemployment after graduating in Zimbabwe.

I had a strong desire to support my family through part-time employment during my course, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn between $50 and $100 per month throughout the course.

While pursuing tertiary education in India is more affordable than universities in Zimbabwe, it comes with its own challenges. I diligently followed the 5'S, which played a crucial role in helping me qualify for this scholarship. I urge you to go through these Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors will ask you questions based on the information in the flyer I have attached

Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

7/3/24, 2:17 PM - +263 78 221 4255: Duly noted
7/3/24, 2:21 PM - Aditi Edoofa: You know, Edoofa is also working closely in collaboration with the Zimbabwean Ambassador to India Dr. G.M Chipare. We have had meetings where Dr. Chipare has recommended the Program offer Scholarships to 10000 Zimbabweans within 3 years. Herewith I have attached the photo from our meetings with him.
7/3/24, 2:22 PM - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
7/3/24, 2:33 PM - +263 78 221 4255: Wow. That's very reassuring. It's great that the ambassador thinks highly of the Edoofa program
7/3/24, 2:36 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Indeed!

 Let me introduce you to the scholarship program that is providing me an opportunity to fulfill all my dreams related to higher education - EDOOFA -Education For All.
7/3/24, 2:36 PM - Aditi Edoofa: To give you an insight about Edoofa, it is a scholarship program initiated by *Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd., INDIA*.

This is an experience that I acknowledge as being a Proud Edoofian!🎉
7/3/24, 2:36 PM - Aditi Edoofa: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees.

3. Ask for support, share your challenges and the things you’re good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make your mentor trust you fully

There is no deadline for the project.
There is no order in which you have to do the project.
There is no limit on how much you have to do a project.

8/3/24, 1:43 PM - Aditi Edoofa: EWYL Line.vcf (file attached)
8/3/24, 1:44 PM - +263 78 221 4255: Okay
8/3/24, 1:44 PM - Aditi Edoofa: You have to come on the EWYL Line and say 'Greetings, Ms. MENTOR NAME, I am <NAME> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....' <This message was edited>

8/3/24, 1:50 PM - +263 78 221 4255: Noted. At 8.30?
8/3/24, 1:52 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Yes!
8/3/24, 1:52 PM - Aditi Edoofa: It serves as a link between every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that most of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.
8/3/24, 1:55 PM - +263 78 221 4255: Understood
8/3/24, 1:56 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Lenon, that concludes our initial orientation. I trust that you've gained valuable insights and anticipate that there will be more to come as we progress towards achieving great success. Our next point of contact will be on the EWYL Line during your scheduled sessions and will follow the Proud Edoofian ritual daily.
8/3/24, 2:00 PM - +263 78 221 4255: I have gained a lot and look forward to our next meeting
8/3/24, 2:11 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I am glad to know that Lenon!
