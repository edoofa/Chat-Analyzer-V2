The EWYL program will indeed play a crucial role in providing you with firsthand professional experience and helping you become self-financed along the way. It's great to see your proactive approach to your education and future career. Keep up the excellent work.
6/2/24, 1:44 PM - +263 71 975 2736: Thank you mam .
6/2/24, 1:45 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
6/2/24, 1:47 PM - +263 71 975 2736: No mam can you tell me .
6/2/24, 1:50 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
6/2/24, 1:50 PM - Aditi Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
6/2/24, 1:58 PM - +263 71 975 2736: Well understood mam, thank you for enlightening me .
6/2/24, 2:00 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skillset through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts. <This message was edited>
6/2/24, 2:09 PM - +263 71 975 2736: I am very proud to know that .
6/2/24, 2:11 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
6/2/24, 2:14 PM - +263 71 975 2736: Yes it does .
6/2/24, 2:16 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 10 minutes should be enough.

26/2/24, 1:30 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Happy Monday!🌺
Hope you are well.

Are you ready for the session?💯
26/2/24, 2:58 PM - Aditi Edoofa: @263719752736 @263774494993 May I know why didn't show Blessing up for today's session?

Hope you are well.

Are you ready for the session?💯
27/2/24, 1:32 PM - +263 71 975 2736: Yes mam .
27/2/24, 1:33 PM - Aditi Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
27/2/24, 1:34 PM - +263 71 975 2736: Ok mam .
27/2/24, 1:35 PM - Aditi Edoofa: -*A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*
  
*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME*
For eg: In your case, it will be-
*BLESSING/ADITI*
27/2/24, 1:35 PM - Aditi Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
27/2/24, 1:35 PM - Aditi Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)

Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
27/2/24, 1:35 PM - Aditi Edoofa: *ADD MENTOR:*

Make sure that before you start interacting with the participants in the group that you created for the community-building project, YOU ADD ME.

The purpose of doing this is that:
- I will be able to track your progress and guide you through learning the networking skill
- I will be able to see the concerns raised by students and we can discuss them accordingly.
- I will be able to see whether the right information has been shared with all the students

27/2/24, 1:40 PM - +263 71 975 2736: Well understood mam .
27/2/24, 1:43 PM - Aditi Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
27/2/24, 1:43 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I am ____________, a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in Zimbabwe, where tuition fees range from ZWL 650,000 to ZWL 750,000 per term. When considering the yearly cost, including food and accommodation, it exceeds $2,100 in our beloved Zimbabwe.

Today, the internet is a necessity, and I truly realized its importance when preparing for my journey to India. We are all well aware of the expenses we have to bear just to access subpar internet services. During my school days, I used to spend a minimum of $35-$40 a month to ensure I had sufficient internet, which added up to around $450-$500 annually. It's remarkable to discover that in India, students value their educational infrastructure so much that they can access a necessity like the internet for around $40 for the entire year.

Conversely, when speaking to my seniors in Zimbabwe, I realized that I might have to compromise on my choice of course due to limited available seats. Furthermore, many seniors are struggling with unemployment after graduating in Zimbabwe.

I had a strong desire to support my family through part-time employment during my course, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn between $50 and $100 per month throughout the course.

While pursuing tertiary education in India is more affordable than universities in Zimbabwe, it comes with its own challenges. I diligently followed the 5'S, which played a crucial role in helping me qualify for this scholarship. I urge you to go through these Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors will ask you questions based on the information in the flyer I have attached

Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

 Let me introduce you to the scholarship program that is providing me an opportunity to fulfill all my dreams related to higher education - EDOOFA -Education For All.
27/2/24, 1:52 PM - Aditi Edoofa: To give you an insight about Edoofa, it is a scholarship program initiated by *Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd., INDIA*. Edoofa believes quality education should be accessible to all and not just the privilege of a few. Through our scholarship program that is based on a work-study model, Edoofa solves both problems, that of *lack of affordability and of employability in higher education.* Edoofa stays with the students throughout their academic life as mentor and caretaker, right from building the application, applying to colleges, training, and making them job-ready. This is an experience that I acknowledge as being a Proud Edoofian!🎉
27/2/24, 1:52 PM - Aditi Edoofa: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, Edoofa has worked with 250+ Universities in India and has a community of *more than 3000 students* from different countries📍
 
Edoofa receives applications from _South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries_. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 2100 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just *affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven* so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains

28/2/24, 2:37 PM - +263 71 975 2736: Q1 : Presbyterian Paraclete college . No.
Q3: Harare .
28/2/24, 2:37 PM - +263 71 975 2736: I am Blessing Ndudzo , a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India . I have always dreamed of studying abroad , especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in Zimbabwe,where tuition fees range from ZWL 650,000 to ZWL 750,000 per term . When considering the yearly cost , including food and accommodation, it exceeds $2,100 in our beloved Zimbabwe. 

Today , the internet is a necessity, and l truly realized it’s important when preparing for my journey to India . We are all well aware of the expenses we have to bear just to access subpar internet services . During my school days , l used to spend a minimum of $35-$40 a month to ensure l had sufficient internet, which added up to around $450-$500 annually. It’s remarkable to discover that in lndia , students value their educational infrastructure so much that they can access a necessity like the internet for around $40 for the entire year . 

Conversely , when speaking to my seniors in Zimbabwe, l realized that l might have to compromise on my choice of course due to limited available seats . Furthermore, many seniors are struggling with unemployment after graduating in Zimbabwe. 

I had a strong desire to support my family through part-time employment during my course , and that’s when l learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn between $50-$1000 per month throughout the course . 

While pursuing tertiary education in India is more affordable than universities in Zimbabwe, it comes with its own challenges . I diligently followed the 5’S , which played a crucial role in helping me qualify for this scholarship. I urge you to go through these Five Pointers with utmost sincerity . The counselors will ask you questions based on the information in the flyer l have attached.
28/2/24, 2:40 PM - Aditi Edoofa: TODAY, I would like you to connect with your School Head. I will be guiding you at every point in this process. Our main aim through this will be to bring the privilege that Edoofa provides to all your schoolmates.

There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to any teacher or student at School with whom you are in touch and ask him/her for your School Head’s Contact.

5/3/24, 1:43 PM - +263 71 975 2736: 👆
5/3/24, 1:54 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I have shared it with the Program Director. <This message was edited>
5/3/24, 1:54 PM - Aditi Edoofa: When the school’s per-term fees are less than $100, we do not get a school call done by Edoofa's Program Director.
The reason behind this is that it is very much doubt that the students from this school will or will not be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education.
So in such a case, we insist that students to forms a WhatsApp where they add me, Mr. Jyotishman, Ms. Deepali, Mr. Abhinav, and the Headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact from that school. After forming the group they:
1) either ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to specifically add those prospective students who will be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education. After they add, then tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
or
2)ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to share those prospective students' contact details with you, so that you can add them and then educate them about Edoofa. After that, tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
5/3/24, 2:00 PM - +263 71 975 2736: Ok mam well understood and am on it .
5/3/24, 2:00 PM - +263 71 975 2736: So it’s possible to go various schools enlightening them about Edoofa right .
5/3/24, 2:08 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Yes!
5/3/24, 2:08 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Now, we’ve come to the end of one part of your onboarding of EWYL. So, I want you to go through this conversation quickly- and highlight any areas, questions, or projects that you may have even the slightest concern with- and let’s resolve them before we move on!
5/3/24, 2:08 PM - +263 71 975 2736: All went well mam .
5/3/24, 2:21 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Awesome!
5/3/24, 2:21 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how you can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-
1. Give your best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss your EWYL sessions without informing your mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share your challenges and the things you’re good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make your mentor trust you fully
5/3/24, 2:42 PM - +263 71 975 2736: Well noted mam .
5/3/24, 2:47 PM - Aditi Edoofa: So here are a few more important points that I would like to share with you regarding the projects.
There is no deadline for the project.
There is no order in which you have to do the project.
There is no limit on how much you have to do a project.
There is no limit to the number of scholarship credits one can earn through projects.
It's simple, the *more you work on it, the more scholarship credits you earn.*
Moreover, it is important *that you make steady progress every day*.
5/3/24, 2:48 PM - +263 71 975 2736: That’s awesome mam , am sure l won’t disappoint .
5/3/24, 2:50 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
5/3/24, 2:51 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Blessing, this concludes our initial orientation. I trust that you've gained valuable insights and anticipate that there will be more to come as we progress toward achieving great success. And I will share the new schedule shortly for your sessions, all the best for your projects
5/3/24, 2:51 PM - +263 71 975 2736: Thank you so much mam , am sure to make progress everyday .
8/3/24, 2:08 PM - +263 71 975 2736: Good afternoon mam .

8/3/24, 2:24 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Blessing, let me clear this out I will only be a silent member in the group monitoring your progress, it's your project and you are supposed to take charge of the conversations in the group.
8/3/24, 2:25 PM - +263 71 975 2736: Ok mam well understood.
8/3/24, 3:59 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Blessing!
