25/1/24, 1:27 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Good Afternoon!✨
Hope you are doing well.

So let's begin with our session🚀
25/1/24, 1:28 PM - +263 71 439 7817: Good afternoon
25/1/24, 1:28 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Well, I can see that there are some other people who have joined the group besides you. May I learn a little about each of them? I would appreciate it if we could engage in a quick conversation and get to know each other a bit.
25/1/24, 1:30 PM - +263 71 439 7817: The other two people are my parents
25/1/24, 1:32 PM - +263 71 439 7817: My mother

25/1/24, 1:56 PM - +263 71 439 7817: Thank you
25/1/24, 2:00 PM - +263 77 837 3731: Thank you
25/1/24, 2:00 PM - +263 71 297 5426: Thank you
25/1/24, 2:04 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
25/1/24, 2:16 PM - +263 71 439 7817: No
25/1/24, 2:18 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
25/1/24, 2:18 PM - Aditi Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
25/1/24, 2:21 PM - +263 77 837 3731: No
25/1/24, 2:25 PM - +263 71 439 7817: I now understand
25/1/24, 2:30 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skillset through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts. 
 S-
25/1/24, 2:33 PM - +263 71 439 7817: It's nice to know you Ms Davi and Ms Sanjana
25/1/24, 2:34 PM - Aditi Edoofa: They are also honored to have you!
25/1/24, 2:35 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I wanted to inform you that tomorrow i.e. 26th January marks Indian Republic Day🇮🇳, a significant occasion celebrating the adoption of our nation's constitution. In observance of this special day, our institution will be closed tomorrow, and there will be no official activities.
Let's reconvene and continue our discussions on Monday🚀
25/1/24, 2:36 PM - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
25/1/24, 2:38 PM - +263 71 439 7817: OK

29/1/24, 1:35 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Embrace the new week with enthusiasm. Your attitude determines your direction, and your positive mindset can turn challenges into opportunities. Make this Monday a stepping stone to success!☀️

So are you ready for the session?🚀

29/1/24, 2:21 PM - +263 71 439 7817: Yes am ready
29/1/24, 2:22 PM - Aditi Edoofa: @263714397817 May I know why you are late for the session?
29/1/24, 2:23 PM - +263 71 439 7817: I was at school the lesson ended late
29/1/24, 2:24 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Okay.
29/1/24, 2:24 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
29/1/24, 2:25 PM - +263 71 439 7817: Yes <This message was edited>
29/1/24, 2:27 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 10 minutes should be enough.

How does that sound?
30/1/24, 2:31 PM - +263 71 439 7817: Fantastic
30/1/24, 2:32 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I would like to ask you a few questions to understand how much from our discussion you could retain and if there is anything for us to discuss again.

If the connection has specific questions, the student should refer them to a manager. The goal of this activity is to arrange for a meeting between the organization and Edoofa, and to facilitate the signing of a contract. It is important to note that there will be follow-up required throughout the process.
9/2/24, 1:42 PM - +263 71 439 7817: This from activity 3
9/2/24, 1:43 PM - +263 71 439 7817: The student's role is to identify and engage with potential employers and partner organizations in their region. The student will use their networking and communication skills to arrange meetings and facilitate the signing of contracts. The outcome of this project is to create a professional network and generate scholarship credits for the student. The activity is broken down into smaller steps to help the student complete the project. We have created a template for students to follow. This will help the student successfully complete the project and understand how to reach out to organizations on behalf of Edoofa . this is about project 1
9/2/24, 1:43 PM - +263 71 439 7817: In summation, Edoofa is emphasizing the importance of its Earn While You Learn (EWYL) program.

9/2/24, 1:44 PM - +263 71 439 7817: **For the sake of brevity, I have kept my summary to the following 4 points.**

in your career and employment.

3. Become future proof by developing transversal skills, that will help you learn new technologies
and also give you flexibility to adapt.

9/2/24, 1:44 PM - Aditi Edoofa: You know what, this is fantastic! This is the kind of comprehension needed in an Edoofian, and voila! You are already so good at it.
9/2/24, 1:45 PM - +263 71 439 7817: Thank you
9/2/24, 1:55 PM - +263 71 439 7817: The primary outcome of this project is to build a network of students and to inspire and help them achieve their educational and career goals.

*Our session will commence today at 1:30 PM.*
22/2/24, 1:27 PM - Aditi Edoofa: So let's begin with today's session🚀
22/2/24, 2:16 PM - +263 71 439 7817: Good afternoon
22/2/24, 2:16 PM - +263 71 439 7817: I deeply apologise am not available today

26/2/24, 2:06 PM - +263 71 439 7817: Good afternoon
26/2/24, 2:12 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I would appreciate it if you can briefly summarize your understanding of it.
26/2/24, 2:14 PM - +263 71 439 7817: Overall, the main takeaway from this is that the best companies to work for are ones that have a strong founder with a relevant background, a stable financial situation, and a reasonable amount of size. These factors will ensure that the company is reputable, well-funded, and likely to provide a good experience for interns. Some of the best places to find information on startups include Google, LinkedIn, Crunchbase, and Inc4media. In addition, platforms like Techzim, Nigeria Startups, and Ghanayello are great resources for finding startups in specific countries.
26/2/24, 2:15 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Amazing, I’m happy with your understanding.
26/2/24, 2:15 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Okay- now here are 2 things I would like to briefly summarize –

26/2/24, 2:18 PM - +263 71 439 7817: Does this project have to be done now
26/2/24, 2:18 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I would like to tell you that currently, *this project is on hold* due to a high volume of ongoing projects and commitments.

I would have to find a student

26/2/24, 2:42 PM - Aditi Edoofa: That’s awesome, I’m confident that if you continue to pay attention to the information shared and then respond accordingly, we will make a great team. Now, here are 2 things I’d like to briefly remind you of from the Community Building Project.


1-  I’m sharing a form with you below, you can share that with the students whom you speak with and think that they truly deserve to be an Edoofian and fulfill their dreams of higher education!

I will be appearing for my Advance Level Examination in (Year):-

Preferred year of Admission:- 
August 2024 or August 2025
26/2/24, 2:42 PM - Aditi Edoofa: And #2 – Back to the exciting part- your *Scholarship Credits*. So, here’s a quick recap of what’s the opportunity for you here-
 1. For every student that enrolls in our Edoofa Program and pays the first part of the enrolment fee, you will be awarded *$20 worth of Scholarship credits*.
2. Similarly, upon completing the Admission Formalities of the university à you will be awarded *$30 worth of Scholarship credits*.
3. There is an additional opportunity to earn $5 worth of Scholarship credits by connecting with students to provide clarity to them about the Edoofa Scholarship, which the Edoofa team will share with you!
26/2/24, 2:43 PM - +263 71 439 7817: Ok
26/2/24, 2:43 PM - Aditi Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
26/2/24, 2:44 PM - +263 71 439 7817: Go ahead
26/2/24, 2:44 PM - Aditi Edoofa: -*A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*
  
*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME*
For eg: In your case, it will be-
*NICOLE/ADITI*
26/2/24, 2:44 PM - Aditi Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
26/2/24, 2:45 PM - Aditi Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)

Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
26/2/24, 2:45 PM - Aditi Edoofa: *ADD MENTOR:*

Make sure that before you start interacting with the participants in the group that you created for the community-building project, YOU ADD ME.

The purpose of doing this is that:
- I will be able to track your progress and guide you through learning the networking skill
- I will be able to see the concerns raised by students and we can discuss them accordingly.
- I will be able to see whether the right information has been shared with all the students

26/2/24, 2:45 PM - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
26/2/24, 2:48 PM - +263 71 439 7817: OK
26/2/24, 2:51 PM - Aditi Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
26/2/24, 2:51 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I am ____________, a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in Zimbabwe, where tuition fees range from ZWL 650,000 to ZWL 750,000 per term. When considering the yearly cost, including food and accommodation, it exceeds $2,100 in our beloved Zimbabwe.

Today, the internet is a necessity, and I truly realized its importance when preparing for my journey to India. We are all well aware of the expenses we have to bear just to access subpar internet services. During my school days, I used to spend a minimum of $35-$40 a month to ensure I had sufficient internet, which added up to around $450-$500 annually. It's remarkable to discover that in India, students value their educational infrastructure so much that they can access a necessity like the internet for around $40 for the entire year.

Conversely, when speaking to my seniors in Zimbabwe, I realized that I might have to compromise on my choice of course due to limited available seats. Furthermore, many seniors are struggling with unemployment after graduating in Zimbabwe.

I had a strong desire to support my family through part-time employment during my course, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn between $50 and $100 per month throughout the course.

While pursuing tertiary education in India is more affordable than universities in Zimbabwe, it comes with its own challenges. I diligently followed the 5'S, which played a crucial role in helping me qualify for this scholarship. I urge you to go through these Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors will ask you questions based on the information in the flyer I have attached

Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

8/3/24, 2:13 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
8/3/24, 2:14 PM - Aditi Edoofa: When the school’s per-term fees are less than $100, we do not get a school call done by Edoofa's Program Director.
The reason behind this is that it is very much doubt that the students from this school will or will not be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education.
So in such a case, we insist that students to forms a WhatsApp group where they add me. After forming the group they:
1) either ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to specifically add those prospective students who will be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education. After they add, then tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
or
2)ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to share those prospective students' contact details with you, so that you can add them and then educate them about Edoofa. After that, tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them

There is no deadline for the project.
There is no order in which you have to do the project.
There is no limit on how much you have to do a project.
There is no limit to the number of scholarship credits one can earn through projects.
It's simple, the *more you work on it, the more scholarship credits you earn.*
Moreover, it is important *that you make steady progress every day*.

8/3/24, 2:50 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Sure @263778373731 in this case we do not want to pressure families who cannot afford education abroad even after a scholarship, that is the reason only a few students out of these schools whose families can afford or who have a sponsor apply for education abroad
