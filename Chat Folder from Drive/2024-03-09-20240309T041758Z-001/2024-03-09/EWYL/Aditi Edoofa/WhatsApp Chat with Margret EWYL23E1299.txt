Yes I am ma'am
29/2/24, 1:41 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
29/2/24, 1:41 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Well, I can see that there are some other people who have joined the group besides you. May I learn a little about each of them? I would appreciate it if we could engage in a quick conversation and get to know each other a bit.
29/2/24, 1:43 PM - +263 77 485 5312: Ok let me arlert them so that you can talk to them, they're my parents.
29/2/24, 1:47 PM - +263 77 485 5312: Seems they are all unavailable, l tried to call Dad his phone is not available ma'am.
29/2/24, 2:00 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, I understand. It's wonderful to have them. I extend a warm welcome to them for the exciting and incredible EWYL journey
29/2/24, 2:00 PM - Aditi Edoofa: So Margret, I would like to begin this journey by knowing you beyond the _Statement of Purpose._ Can you share with me what are your long-term goals and how do you think this EWYL Program will help you in achieving them?
29/2/24, 2:05 PM - +263 77 485 5312: My long term goals is to archive a degree in law and then move on to learn more up until l become a judge. This program will help me through getting experience and through my expenses
29/2/24, 2:15 PM - Aditi Edoofa: It's admirable to hear about your long-term goals of pursuing a degree in law and eventually becoming a judge. The determination and dedication you have towards achieving these aspirations are commendable. The EWYL will undoubtedly provide valuable experience and support towards reaching these goals, both in terms of gaining practical experience and helping with expenses along the way. Keep focused on your dreams, and with hard work and perseverance, you can surely achieve them.
29/2/24, 2:16 PM - +263 77 485 5312: I promise I will ma'am.
29/2/24, 2:18 PM - +263 77 430 4040: Hello ma'am, l'm Margaret's mother. I am happy to be with you,
29/2/24, 2:29 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I am also glad that you are actively participating in her EWYL journey. <This message was edited>
29/2/24, 2:29 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
29/2/24, 2:31 PM - +263 77 485 5312: No ma'am may you please shed light on the two.
29/2/24, 2:48 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
29/2/24, 2:48 PM - Aditi Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
29/2/24, 2:58 PM - +263 77 349 9806: I am Margret father.l am fyn and how are you.
29/2/24, 3:10 PM - Aditi Edoofa: It's wonderful to connect with you. I extend a warm welcome to you for the exciting and incredible EWYL journey
29/2/24, 3:10 PM - Aditi Edoofa: The session time has concluded for now, we will meet tomorrow for our session at the same time, so make sure you are on time.⌛

1/3/24, 1:44 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skillset through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts. <This message was edited>
1/3/24, 1:46 PM - +263 77 485 5312: I am glad to have them here
1/3/24, 2:01 PM - +263 77 349 9806: Good afternoon madam.
1/3/24, 2:40 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Great, please excuse me for the delay in reply as I was facing some network challenges.
1/3/24, 2:40 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
1/3/24, 2:42 PM - +263 77 485 5312: Yes ma'am.
1/3/24, 2:52 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 10 minutes should be enough.

5/3/24, 1:48 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Awesome! Did you notice the _Edoofa Hall of Inspiration_? I am sure you would one day want yourself to be celebrated in this section, the entire Student community reads this newsletter and it's a great deal to be mentioned by the founder himself, isn't it?
5/3/24, 1:49 PM - +263 77 485 5312: It is a very big deal, l hope and believe that one day l will be in the newsletter also.
5/3/24, 2:01 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I am sure you will be featured one day!
5/3/24, 2:01 PM - Aditi Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound?
5/3/24, 2:04 PM - +263 77 485 5312: It sounds very interesting.
5/3/24, 2:12 PM - Aditi Edoofa: We’re ready to begin your EWYL program now, and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects you can and will be a part of. Once you’ve gone through it thoroughly- we can discuss your understanding and then help you get started with the projects! Is it clear?
5/3/24, 2:13 PM - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
5/3/24, 2:13 PM - +263 77 485 5312: Yes ma'am.
5/3/24, 2:23 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, that’s wonderful. I want you to share your understanding of the document with me. I just want to ensure we don’t miss anything!
5/3/24, 2:25 PM - +263 77 485 5312: Ok I will do that as soon as I am done reading it ma'am
5/3/24, 2:25 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Sure!

6/3/24, 1:53 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Awesome!
6/3/24, 1:53 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Additionally, I want to inform you that at present, the first project is on hold owing to the substantial number of projects and commitments we are currently managing. We are prioritizing our efforts to ensure the successful completion of existing tasks before resuming work on this project. Till that time you may focus on the projects that I am going to explain.
6/3/24, 1:54 PM - +263 77 485 5312: Ok ma'am
6/3/24, 2:02 PM - Aditi Edoofa: *I think we’re ready to move to the community building project!* This project is quite possibly a student favorite! So, now I am going to share an audio file from our mentorship team and you ensure you don’t miss anything in it and use this time to play this audio more than once, let’s get to it!
6/3/24, 2:02 PM - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
6/3/24, 2:05 PM - +263 77 485 5312: Very interesting.
6/3/24, 2:16 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, so very quickly-can you summarize whatever you learned in the audio for me? Just so we’re on the same page about it.
6/3/24, 2:23 PM - +263 77 485 5312: I have learnt that the edoofians has a sense of community building which strengthen relationships . And they work towards one goal. They are have a sense of belonging in the community which builds the sense of responsibility. The project wants us to have a mindset of identify opportunities and create an impact in the lives of others. And to complete the project we have to reach the students who are in their last year of senior secondary or those who graduated from secondary.
6/3/24, 2:28 PM - Aditi Edoofa: That’s awesome, I’m confident that if you continue to pay attention to the information shared and then respond accordingly, we will make a great team. Now, here are 2 things I’d like to briefly remind you of from the Community Building Project.


1-  I’m sharing a form with you below, you can share that with the students whom you speak with and think that they truly deserve to be an Edoofian and fulfill their dreams of higher education!

6/3/24, 2:29 PM - Aditi Edoofa: And #2 – Back to the exciting part- your *Scholarship Credits*. So, here’s a quick recap of what’s the opportunity for you here-
 1. For every student that enrolls in our Edoofa Program and pays the first part of the enrolment fee, you will be awarded *$20 worth of Scholarship credits*.
2. Similarly, upon completing the Admission Formalities of the university à you will be awarded *$30 worth of Scholarship credits*.
3. There is an additional opportunity to earn $5 worth of Scholarship credits by connecting with students to provide clarity to them about the Edoofa Scholarship, which the Edoofa team will share with you!
6/3/24, 2:31 PM - +263 77 485 5312: That's great ma'am.
6/3/24, 2:34 PM - Aditi Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
6/3/24, 2:35 PM - Aditi Edoofa: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*
  
*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME*
For eg: In your case, it will be-
*MARGRET/ADITI*
6/3/24, 2:35 PM - Aditi Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
6/3/24, 2:35 PM - Aditi Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)

Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
6/3/24, 2:35 PM - Aditi Edoofa: *ADD MENTOR:*

Make sure that before you start interacting with the participants in the group that you created for the community-building project, YOU ADD ME.

The purpose of doing this is that:
- I will be able to track your progress and guide you through learning the networking skill
- I will be able to see the concerns raised by students and we can discuss them accordingly.
- I will be able to see whether the right information has been shared with all the students

6/3/24, 2:39 PM - +263 77 485 5312: Noted ma'am, so now I will start looking for the students who can suit for the EDOOFA scholarship
6/3/24, 2:43 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Yes!
6/3/24, 2:44 PM - Aditi Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
6/3/24, 2:44 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I am ____________, a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in Zimbabwe, where tuition fees range from ZWL 650,000 to ZWL 750,000 per term. When considering the yearly cost, including food and accommodation, it exceeds $2,100 in our beloved Zimbabwe.

Today, the internet is a necessity, and I truly realized its importance when preparing for my journey to India. We are all well aware of the expenses we have to bear just to access subpar internet services. During my school days, I used to spend a minimum of $35-$40 a month to ensure I had sufficient internet, which added up to around $450-$500 annually. It's remarkable to discover that in India, students value their educational infrastructure so much that they can access a necessity like the internet for around $40 for the entire year.

Conversely, when speaking to my seniors in Zimbabwe, I realized that I might have to compromise on my choice of course due to limited available seats. Furthermore, many seniors are struggling with unemployment after graduating in Zimbabwe.

I had a strong desire to support my family through part-time employment during my course, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn between $50 and $100 per month throughout the course.

While pursuing tertiary education in India is more affordable than universities in Zimbabwe, it comes with its own challenges. I diligently followed the 5'S, which played a crucial role in helping me qualify for this scholarship. I urge you to go through these Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors will ask you questions based on the information in the flyer I have attached

Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

6/3/24, 2:51 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Along with this share the following information ABOUT Edoofa with them:

 Let me introduce you to the scholarship program that is providing me an opportunity to fulfill all my dreams related to higher education - EDOOFA -Education For All.
6/3/24, 2:51 PM - Aditi Edoofa: To give you an insight about Edoofa, it is a scholarship program initiated by *Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd., INDIA*. Edoofa believes quality education should be accessible to all and not just the privilege of a few. Through our scholarship program that is based on a work-study model, Edoofa solves both problems, that of *lack of affordability and of employability in higher education.* Edoofa stays with the students throughout their academic life as mentor and caretaker, right from building the application, applying to colleges, training, and making them job-ready. This is an experience that I acknowledge as being a Proud Edoofian!🎉
6/3/24, 2:51 PM - Aditi Edoofa: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, Edoofa has worked with 250+ Universities in India and has a community of *more than 3000 students* from different countries📍
 
Edoofa receives applications from _South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries_. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 2100 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just *affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven* so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains

Hope you are well.

I am doing well thank you.
Yes I am
7/3/24, 1:38 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I am well. Thanks for asking. <This message was edited>
7/3/24, 1:39 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Now, we’ve come to the end of one part of your onboarding of EWYL. So, I want you to go through this conversation quickly- and highlight any areas, questions, or projects that you may have even the slightest concern with- and let’s resolve them before we move on!
7/3/24, 1:41 PM - +263 77 485 5312: My only question is while I form the groups for the students who are suit for the program, do l have to create one group for everyone l found or l create it for the individual student, so far l have 2 students who are willing to apply though currently they are not online ma'am.
7/3/24, 1:48 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Yes, Margret you create one group for all of the students and add them and share the information about Edoofa Scholarship program there.
7/3/24, 1:51 PM - +263 77 485 5312: Ok thank you.
There's a student who asked me that, for they're facing problems yet she seat for her A level last year in November 2023, but she is looking forward to go to university next year if things are stable, and wish to study in lndia also, so can she apply now or she will apply next year.
7/3/24, 1:54 PM - Aditi Edoofa: She can apply now. Get the form filled out by her.
7/3/24, 1:56 PM - +263 77 485 5312: Ok ma'am thank.
For now that's are the questions l have. If l have some l will come back to you ma'am.
7/3/24, 2:05 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Sure!
7/3/24, 2:05 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how you can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-
1. Give your best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss your EWYL sessions without informing your mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share your challenges and the things you’re good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make your mentor trust you fully
7/3/24, 2:06 PM - +263 77 485 5312: Noted ma'am.
7/3/24, 2:11 PM - Aditi Edoofa: So here are a few more important points that I would like to share with you regarding the projects.
There is no deadline for the project.
There is no order in which you have to do the project.
There is no limit on how much you have to do a project.
There is no limit to the number of scholarship credits one can earn through projects.
It's simple, the *more you work on it, the more scholarship credits you earn.*
Moreover, it is important *that you make steady progress every day*.
7/3/24, 2:12 PM - +263 77 485 5312: Noted ma'am. Thank you 😊
7/3/24, 2:13 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Margret, this concludes our initial orientation. I trust that you've gained valuable insights and anticipate that there will be more to come as we progress toward achieving great success. And I will share the new schedule shortly for your sessions, all the best for your projects
7/3/24, 2:14 PM - +263 77 485 5312: Thank you ma'am.
