22/2/24, 3:42 PM - +263 77 263 2746: Ashy is at school. Phones not allowed. Us we will be at work during the day sometimes out of town on work
22/2/24, 4:03 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Thank you for informing me about Ashley's situation. It's understandable that phones are not allowed at school and that you'll be occupied with work, sometimes even out of town. We appreciate your communication regarding these constraints. But I would recommend you to make efforts and complete the initial orientation on Ashley's behalf.
23/2/24, 7:09 AM - +263 77 263 2746: In that case send the messages then will go through them during the any available free time

27/2/24, 2:36 PM - Aditi Edoofa: @263772632746 @263718813922 @263776579673 I'm expressing profound disappointment over your absence from our planned session today, with no prior notification. I have faith that you understand the significance of these sessions and the vital need to consistently attend them.
27/2/24, 2:39 PM - +263 77 263 2746: We are employees who has difficult to be on phones at every moment. Ashley is at school where they do not allow phones. Hence have made a request that you send the tasks and will attend to them after 1700hrs . You are then able to see them following day
28/2/24, 3:12 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Good afternoon @263772632746

29/2/24, 1:40 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I am well. Thanks for aksing.
29/2/24, 1:41 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Moving ahead, I'd like to tell you about the *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
29/2/24, 1:53 PM - +263 77 263 2746: Interested to know more
29/2/24, 2:06 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring that *Ashley* is prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach his professional goals.
29/2/24, 2:06 PM - Aditi Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of the student’s tuition fees.
29/2/24, 2:10 PM - +263 77 263 2746: Well understood
29/2/24, 2:19 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skillset through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
29/2/24, 2:23 PM - +263 77 263 2746: Noted
29/2/24, 2:35 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
29/2/24, 2:37 PM - +263 77 263 2746: Yes , we can proceed
29/2/24, 2:52 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 10 minutes should be enough.

1/3/24, 2:23 PM - +263 77 263 2746: Very true
1/3/24, 2:41 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Indeed!

1/3/24, 2:41 PM - Aditi Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound?

8/3/24, 1:38 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Sure! <This message was edited>
8/3/24, 1:38 PM - Aditi Edoofa: We’re ready to begin your EWYL program now, and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects you can and will be a part of. Once you’ve gone through it thoroughly- we can discuss your understanding and then help you get started with the projects! Is it clear?
8/3/24, 1:38 PM - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
8/3/24, 1:54 PM - +263 77 263 2746: Gone through the document the whole purpose of this is to empower the Child with Knowledge and skills, preparing for his carrier right???
8/3/24, 1:55 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Indeed, did you notice the three projects mentioned in the document?
8/3/24, 1:57 PM - +263 77 263 2746: I noticed and unfortunately. We can only wait for Ashley to be back from school. He is the right candidate to do the given projects there by aquiring skills for his carrier. If I do that means it's me getting the skills which I see becomes non beneficial to the student
8/3/24, 1:59 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Indeed, Ashley will be the one working on projects.
8/3/24, 2:00 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how *Ashley* can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-
1. Give best in the projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss EWYL sessions without informing the mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share challenges and the things *Ashley* is good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make mentor trust the student fully
8/3/24, 2:03 PM - +263 77 263 2746: The best dates is from the 27th of March as he will be on school break. At moment he won't be able to participate as cellphones are not permitted at his school.

Kindly schedule these sessions from the 27th of March 2024
8/3/24, 2:04 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I understand! <This message was edited>
8/3/24, 2:05 PM - Aditi Edoofa: As per our Academic Board terms, you need to draft a mail to Ms. Sanjana, Head of Department, and me stating that:
Greetings of the day,
I, <NAME>, from <SCHOOL> and Group name <EWYL GROUP NAME> won't be able to continue with my EWYL program till _ (date) because I am having my classes from _ to __ (date) and I will reach out to my mentor, Ms. Aditi as soon as I am available.
