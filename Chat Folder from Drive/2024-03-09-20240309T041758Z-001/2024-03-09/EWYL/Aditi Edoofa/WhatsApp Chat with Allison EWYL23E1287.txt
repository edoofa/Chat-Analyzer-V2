Hope you are well.

It's a pleasure to meet you, Allison Grace Banda! Thank you for sharing a bit about yourself. Your aspirations to study law, particularly corporate law, are admirable. Your qualities as a good listener, goal-oriented individual, and someone who can craft persuasive arguments will undoubtedly serve you well in your chosen field. It's inspiring to hear that you want to be a voice for the voiceless and advocate for those who may not have a platform to express their rights. Your determination to pursue your goals and make a positive impact on society is commendable. Keep nurturing those qualities and pursuing your dreams with dedication. <This message was edited>

Hope you are well.

Are you ready for the session?🚀
29/2/24, 1:42 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Well, I can see that there are some other people who have joined the group besides you. May I learn a little about each of them? I would appreciate it if we could engage in a quick conversation and get to know each other a bit.
29/2/24, 1:45 PM - +263 71 669 8958: Ok...,  both my parents joined the group. My father is a commissioner of oaths and my mother is a Church secretary.
29/2/24, 1:50 PM - +263 77 872 0711: Good afternoon how are you. I am Allison's father and am very much eager to assist in any way for my daughter to pursue her dreams.

29/2/24, 2:18 PM - Aditi Edoofa: That's great!
29/2/24, 2:18 PM - Aditi Edoofa: So Allison, I would like to begin this journey by knowing you beyond the _Statement of Purpose._ Can you share with me what are your long-term goals and how do you think this EWYL Program will help you in achieving them?
29/2/24, 2:29 PM - +263 71 669 8958: My long term goals are I want to get a degree in BA-LLB and focus on co operate law. By the time I attain my goals and a degree in BA-LLB I will be able to deal with the formation and operation of business and and the laws that must be followed. The EWYL program will help me in the sence that I will gain experience in the business and the affordability of fees.
29/2/24, 2:42 PM - Aditi Edoofa: It's fantastic to hear about your long-term goals of obtaining a degree in BA-LLB and specializing in corporate law. Your aspirations to navigate the complexities of business formation and operation, while ensuring adherence to legal regulations, demonstrate a clear focus and determination.
Participating in the EWYL program will undoubtedly be beneficial towards achieving your goals.

With your dedication and the support of EWYL and I will be there for you at every step, there's no doubt that you'll be well-prepared to make significant contributions in the field of corporate law. Keep pursuing your dreams with determination and enthusiasm!
29/2/24, 2:45 PM - +263 71 669 8958: Ok..., thank you.
29/2/24, 2:46 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
29/2/24, 2:47 PM - +263 71 669 8958: No..., you can explain.
29/2/24, 2:48 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
29/2/24, 2:48 PM - Aditi Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
29/2/24, 2:50 PM - +263 71 669 8958: Ooooh, ok. I understand.
29/2/24, 3:02 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skillset through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
29/2/24, 3:03 PM - +263 71 669 8958: Ok...., so they are in this group as well?
29/2/24, 3:04 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Yes!
29/2/24, 3:05 PM - Aditi Edoofa: The session time has concluded for now, we will meet tomorrow for our session at the same time, so make sure you are on time.⌛
29/2/24, 3:06 PM - +263 71 669 8958: Ok..., seize the day.
1/3/24, 1:34 PM - +263 71 669 8958: Good afternoon...., I am ready for the session, we can proceed.
1/3/24, 1:38 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Happy New Month🌸!
Hope you are doing well.

So are you ready for today's session?🚀
1/3/24, 1:39 PM - +263 71 669 8958: Thank you and same..... Yes I am ready for the session.
1/3/24, 1:46 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Thank you and Great!
1/3/24, 1:46 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
1/3/24, 1:50 PM - +263 71 669 8958: Yeah.., it sounds very interesting.
1/3/24, 2:28 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 10 minutes should be enough.

5/3/24, 1:38 PM - +263 71 669 8958: Yes I am.
5/3/24, 1:45 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Did you notice the _Edoofa Hall of Inspiration_? I am sure you would one day want yourself to be celebrated in this section, the entire Student community reads this newsletter and it's a great deal to be mentioned by the founder himself, isn't it?
5/3/24, 1:49 PM - +263 71 669 8958: Yeah it's good. I  really did get inspired to work.
5/3/24, 2:00 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Awesome!
5/3/24, 2:00 PM - Aditi Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound?
5/3/24, 2:06 PM - +263 71 669 8958: It sounds great.., that's good. Thank you.
5/3/24, 2:15 PM - Aditi Edoofa: We’re ready to begin your EWYL program now, and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects you can and will be a part of. Once you’ve gone through it thoroughly- we can discuss your understanding and then help you get started with the projects! Is it clear?
5/3/24, 2:15 PM - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
5/3/24, 2:17 PM - +263 71 669 8958: Yes it's understandable.
5/3/24, 2:27 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I would appreciate it if you can briefly summarize your understanding of it.
5/3/24, 2:56 PM - +263 71 669 8958: I have finished reading the document.
5/3/24, 3:00 PM - Aditi Edoofa: The current session has come to an end. Let's reconvene tomorrow at the same time for our next session. Please ensure that you're punctual. ⌛
5/3/24, 3:02 PM - +263 71 669 8958: Ok...., thank you.
6/3/24, 1:02 PM - +263 71 669 8958: Good afternoon...., we can proceed with our lesson.
6/3/24, 1:35 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Good afternoon!☀️
Hope you are well.

Are you ready for today's session?🚀
6/3/24, 1:39 PM - +263 71 669 8958: Yes.
6/3/24, 1:53 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Additionally, I want to inform you that at present, the first project is on hold owing to the substantial number of projects and commitments we are currently managing. We are prioritizing our efforts to ensure the successful completion of existing tasks before resuming work on this project. Till that time you may focus on the projects that I am going to explain.
6/3/24, 1:55 PM - +263 71 669 8958: Ok.., I understand.
6/3/24, 1:55 PM - Aditi Edoofa: *I think we’re ready to move to the community building project!* This project is quite possibly a student favorite! So, now I am going to share an audio file from our mentorship team and you ensure you don’t miss anything in it and use this time to play this audio more than once, let’s get to it!
6/3/24, 1:55 PM - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
6/3/24, 2:25 PM - +263 71 669 8958: I'm done.
6/3/24, 2:29 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, so very quickly-can you summarize whatever you learned in the audio for me? Just so we’re on the same page about it.
6/3/24, 2:36 PM - +263 71 669 8958: The main point is you are expecting me to use your networking skills to refer other students to the Edoofa program so that I can earn scholarship credits through referring others to their Edoofa program.
6/3/24, 2:37 PM - +263 77 872 0711: These are your networking skills
6/3/24, 2:38 PM - +263 77 872 0711: Kutaura nevanhu to join and study through Edoofa.
6/3/24, 2:39 PM - +263 77 872 0711: Bringing students to them so that the Edoofa program can grow
6/3/24, 2:39 PM - +263 71 669 8958: And you also want me to  grow the Edoofa program by  referring other prospective students . Every successful student I bring will earn your points and I will earn the points as well.
6/3/24, 2:43 PM - Aditi Edoofa: That’s awesome, I’m confident that if you continue to pay attention to the information shared and then respond accordingly, we will make a great team. Now, here are 2 things I’d like to briefly remind you of from the Community Building Project.


1-  I’m sharing a form with you below, you can share that with the students whom you speak with and think that they truly deserve to be an Edoofian and fulfill their dreams of higher education!

I will be appearing for my Advance Level Examination in (Year):-

Preferred year of Admission:- 
August 2024 or August 2025
6/3/24, 2:43 PM - Aditi Edoofa: And #2 – Back to the exciting part- your *Scholarship Credits*. So, here’s a quick recap of what’s the opportunity for you here-
 1. For every student that enrolls in our Edoofa Program and pays the first part of the enrolment fee, you will be awarded *$20 worth of Scholarship credits*.
2. Similarly, upon completing the Admission Formalities of the university à you will be awarded *$30 worth of Scholarship credits*.
3. There is an additional opportunity to earn $5 worth of Scholarship credits by connecting with students to provide clarity to them about the Edoofa Scholarship, which the Edoofa team will share with you!
6/3/24, 2:44 PM - +263 71 669 8958: The process is establishing and strengthening relationships and shared identities among individuals within a particular group.
6/3/24, 2:45 PM - +263 71 669 8958: Ok.....,thank you.
6/3/24, 2:48 PM - Aditi Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
6/3/24, 2:48 PM - Aditi Edoofa: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*
  
*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME*
For eg: In your case, it will be-
*ALLISON/ADITI*
6/3/24, 2:48 PM - Aditi Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
6/3/24, 2:48 PM - Aditi Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)

Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
6/3/24, 2:48 PM - Aditi Edoofa: *ADD MENTOR:*

Make sure that before you start interacting with the participants in the group that you created for the community-building project, YOU ADD ME.

The purpose of doing this is that:
- I will be able to track your progress and guide you through learning the networking skill
- I will be able to see the concerns raised by students and we can discuss them accordingly.
- I will be able to see whether the right information has been shared with all the students
6/3/24, 2:54 PM - +263 71 669 8958: This therefore create a supportive environment a to work towards common goals. To successfully complete this project I am supposed to reach out to other African students who have recently graduated from the University or who are on the final year. Throughout the project Edoofa will provide guidance to ensure that the students are successful in their efforts.
6/3/24, 2:55 PM - +263 71 669 8958: As a person coming from an African experience where we need educational growth and access to quality and affordable education, I believe I am required to use my networking skills to develop the Edoofa program by referring other prospective students who have either completed their secondary education or who are about to finish. This way, I will be contributing in team building as well as assisting in the growth of the Edoofa program
6/3/24, 2:55 PM - +263 71 669 8958: Resultantly earning me scholarship credit points.
6/3/24, 2:55 PM - +263 71 669 8958: Ok..., thank you.
6/3/24, 2:58 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Superb!!!
