16/2/24, 5:36 PM - Aditi Edoofa: While we were having multiple conversations with our students in the past few days for the meet & greet event, we figured that there is a slight confusion in the invitation dates.

The past three days flew by in a whirlwind for Team Edoofa – both for those in India and those in Harare for the Meet and Greet '24. Now that we've had a chance to catch our breath, I want to extend my sincere gratitude to you for being a part of the event and contributing to its success.

Your insights from the event are highly valued, and I'm keen to hear about your experience. Would you be open to sharing your thoughts, including your interest in attending similar events in the future and any suggestions for improvement? Additionally, if you have captured any memorable moments in photos, we would greatly appreciate you sharing them.

Your perspective is crucial, and I also encourage you to discuss the event with your parents and gather their feedback.
20/2/24, 4:53 PM - +263 77 756 5352: Hello Ms Aditi. I'm sorry I failed my daughter. I was admitted in hospital since Thursday with hyper glycemia. I was discharged on Monday so we failed to attend the event. I hope she will not fail to attend the next event.
22/2/24, 7:58 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Good Morning Pearl!
Hope you are well.

Team Edoofa experienced a whirlwind over the past three days, with activities bustling in both India and Harare for the Meet and Greet '24 event. After a brief moment to collect ourselves, we're ready to return to our original schedule and move forward in our journey. 
*Our session will commence today at 8:30 AM.*
22/2/24, 7:59 AM - Aditi Edoofa: I'm truly sorry to hear about your health struggles and the inconvenience caused by your hospitalization. Your daughter's absence at the event is completely understandable given the circumstances. Your health is paramount, and I hope you're feeling better now.

Rest assured, there will be future events, and we look forward to having your daughter join us then. In the meantime, please take good care

1/3/24, 3:00 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Today's session concludes here.

6/3/24, 1:39 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
6/3/24, 1:40 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring that *Pearl* is prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach her professional goals.
6/3/24, 1:40 PM - Aditi Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of the student’s tuition fees.
6/3/24, 1:44 PM - +263 77 756 5352: Following
6/3/24, 1:59 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
6/3/24, 2:03 PM - +263 77 756 5352: Welcome ladies
6/3/24, 2:15 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates *Pearl* to connect with us over a minimum of 4 times a week i.eThe student will be having 2 sessions on either *Monday/Thursday* or *Tuesday/Friday*. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that the students practically execute what they learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
6/3/24, 3:02 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Concluding our session, I want to say it's been an amazing conversation, and I can't wait for our next one.
6/3/24, 3:23 PM - +263 77 756 5352: Good day
7/3/24, 1:34 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Good afternoon on this beautiful day!
Hope you are well.

Are you ready for today's session?🚀
7/3/24, 1:36 PM - +263 77 756 5352: I am well thank you. I'm ready for the session.
7/3/24, 1:37 PM - +263 77 756 5352: Pearl is in school and they are prohibited from taking cellphones to school. She can only access her phone around 5pm when she gets home
7/3/24, 1:44 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Sure, I understand.
7/3/24, 1:44 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once *Pearl* forms a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 05 minutes should be enough.

7/3/24, 2:00 PM - +263 77 756 5352: I am through
7/3/24, 2:08 PM - Aditi Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the three goals I have set for myself for *Pearl*’S EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure *Pearl* is given enough opportunities to self-finance higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that is learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare for the real-world workplace and grow holistically!
7/3/24, 2:43 PM - +263 77 756 5352: That's brilliant
7/3/24, 2:46 PM - Aditi Edoofa: For the most part of the EWYL journey, the students would work on three major projects to learn & earn as many scholarship credits as they can and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects that *Pearl* will be a part of. Let me know once you have gone through the same.
7/3/24, 2:46 PM - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
7/3/24, 3:01 PM - Aditi Edoofa: So we are concluding today's session and we will connect tomorrow!🌸
8/3/24, 1:36 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Happy Friday!🌸
