6/2/24, 1:43 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I am well. Thanks for asking!
6/2/24, 1:44 PM - +263 78 723 1295: That's great,,,,,, now in the mood to begin our session
6/2/24, 1:48 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
6/2/24, 1:48 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Well, I can see that there are some other people who have joined the group besides you. May I learn a little about each of them? I would appreciate it if we could engage in a quick conversation and get to know each other a bit.
6/2/24, 1:58 PM - +263 78 723 1295: The other 2, that's my mom and dad, and the remaining l think they are from Edoofa
6/2/24, 1:59 PM - Aditi Edoofa: It's wonderful to connect with your parents. I extend a warm welcome to them for the exciting and incredible EWYL journey
6/2/24, 2:00 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I would like to begin this journey by knowing you beyond the _Statement of Purpose._ Can you share with me what are your long-term goals and how do you think this EWYL Program will help you in achieving them?
6/2/24, 2:02 PM - +263 78 723 1295: It is also our pleasure for connecting with you
6/2/24, 2:12 PM - +263 78 723 1295: Goals are set in life so that one can set an example and also to put their whole forcus and effort towards their gaols.

This is what l have done and l have already made my mind completely that one day my goals will be fulfilled. My long term goal is to become a successful and trustworthy young Bio Technological doctor in the future. Having a degree in medicine is one of my dreams because l have loved to become one from the beginning.  And with this l am doing my best to achieve and fulfill this since it does not come on a silver plate but rather requires maximum effort.
6/2/24, 2:15 PM - Aditi Edoofa: It's truly inspiring to hear about your determination and commitment to your goals! Setting clear objectives is essential for paving the path to success and making a positive impact. Your ambition to become a trustworthy young Bio Technological doctor is commendable, and pursuing a degree in medicine aligns perfectly with your passion and aspirations. Your proactive approach and dedicated efforts are key ingredients for achieving this dream, and I have no doubt that with your perseverance, you'll excel in your journey towards becoming a successful professional in the field. Keep up the incredible work, and may your unwavering determination guide you to the fulfillment of your aspirations!
6/2/24, 2:15 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
6/2/24, 2:16 PM - +263 78 723 1295: No you can say a little bit about the two key objectives
6/2/24, 2:17 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
6/2/24, 2:17 PM - Aditi Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
6/2/24, 2:18 PM - +263 78 723 1295: That's so incredible and very helpful
6/2/24, 2:18 PM - +263 73 242 8998: Greetings to everyone,  sorry joining you a bit late,  as parent to Shalom, I'm happy that all is progressing well and I am happy to offer you my maximum support to ensure our daughter achieves her desired goals in life.
6/2/24, 2:20 PM - +263 73 242 8998: We will connect whenever we manage in terms time
6/2/24, 2:21 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Hello and welcome! It's wonderful to have you join us, and your support means a great deal to us all. Shalom is fortunate to have such a supportive parent like you, dedicated to her success and aspirations. With your encouragement and our collective efforts, I have no doubt that she will accomplish remarkable things and achieve her goals in life. Thank you for your unwavering support, and let's work together to empower Shalom on her journey to success!
6/2/24, 2:22 PM - +263 73 242 8998: Thank you very much
6/2/24, 2:23 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skillset through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
6/2/24, 2:31 PM - +263 78 723 1295: It is so lovely to meet you
6/2/24, 2:31 PM - Aditi Edoofa: They are also honored to have you!
6/2/24, 2:31 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Concluding our session, I want to say it's been an amazing conversation.
Have a good day!
6/2/24, 2:35 PM - +263 78 723 1295: Well appreciated the most
Be blessed
7/2/24, 1:30 PM - +263 78 723 1295: Greetings everyone
7/2/24, 1:31 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Good Afternoon!☀️
Hope you are well.

Are you ready for the session?🚀
7/2/24, 1:32 PM - +263 78 723 1295: Yes we can begin
7/2/24, 1:33 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
7/2/24, 1:34 PM - +263 78 723 1295: Yeah sounds very brilliant indeed
7/2/24, 1:39 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 10 minutes should be enough.
7/2/24, 1:39 PM - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
7/2/24, 1:39 PM - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
7/2/24, 2:01 PM - +263 78 723 1295: I have gone through the letters
7/2/24, 2:02 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Did you notice the _Edoofa Hall of Inspiration_? I am sure you would one day want yourself to be celebrated in this section, the entire Student community reads this newsletter and it's a great deal to be mentioned by the founder himself, isn't it?
7/2/24, 2:04 PM - +263 78 723 1295: Yes I would love that too
7/2/24, 2:04 PM - Aditi Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound?
7/2/24, 2:06 PM - +263 78 723 1295: It is so amazing and l feel very safe in your hands
7/2/24, 2:07 PM - Aditi Edoofa: That's such a kind compliment, thank you!
7/2/24, 2:07 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Now, I would like to ask you a few questions to understand how much from our discussion you could retain and if there is anything for us to discuss again.
7/2/24, 2:07 PM - Aditi Edoofa: So here are the questions, answer them in detail:

1. Share a small introduction of everyone on your  EWYL team.
2. What goals has your mentor set for your EWYL journey?
3. How does Mr. Angad Singh, founder of Edoofa, interact with all students?
A. Newsletter       B. Youtube

4. Explain in your own words what the Hall of Inspiration is.
7/2/24, 2:33 PM - Aditi Edoofa: We're finishing up our session now! 😊 It's been awesome, and I can't wait for our next one! 🚀
7/2/24, 2:38 PM - +263 78 723 1295: 1. My EWYL Mentor is Ms Aditi and l'm very great indeed to have her as my mentor. Not forgetting Ms. Sanjana who is the Head of the Department and all group conservations will be monitored. We also have Ms. David who is the Head couch and they will ensure that l achieve the desired skillet through the EWYL course. I very pleased to have them as my team.

2. My mentor has set goals for me and this includes making sure that my academic journey is GREAT. Also she will ensure that l have been given enough opportunities to self-finance my higher education and most importantly to work towards attaining the main objective, that l am learning and evolving with the relevant 21st century skills.

3. Through the Newsletter

4. The hall of inspiration was written by one of the Edoofians and it has truly explained that going to school is not all about being a legend in academics or sports but rather should also be able to interact with your society. One should be kind and generous to help the needy  and the privileged.This helps you to feel better and you will be grateful to raise someone for his/her better standards.

Meeting people you have been communicating with on social media platforms is such a relief and we really appreciate. This helps us to each other even better regardless the interaction before and it also helps us to get more detailed information.

5/3/24, 6:32 PM - +263 73 242 8998: Good day, how are you everyone.

6/3/24, 1:44 PM - +263 78 723 1295: Yes l'm ready
6/3/24, 1:55 PM - +263 78 723 1295: l'm great this side,, how are you
6/3/24, 2:02 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I am well. Thanks for asking.
6/3/24, 2:09 PM - Aditi Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
6/3/24, 2:10 PM - Aditi Edoofa: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*
  
*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME*
For eg: In your case, it will be-
*SHALOM/ADITI*
6/3/24, 2:10 PM - Aditi Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
6/3/24, 2:10 PM - Aditi Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)

Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
]
6/3/24, 2:10 PM - Aditi Edoofa: *ADD MENTOR:*

Make sure that before you start interacting with the participants in the group that you created for the community-building project, YOU ADD ME.

The purpose of doing this is that:
- I will be able to track your progress and guide you through learning the networking skill
- I will be able to see the concerns raised by students and we can discuss them accordingly.
- I will be able to see whether the right information has been shared with all the students

6/3/24, 2:10 PM - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
6/3/24, 2:21 PM - +263 78 723 1295: Oky thanks for sharing the information so this means l have to create a WhatsApp group with these students right???
6/3/24, 2:24 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Yes!
6/3/24, 2:24 PM - Aditi Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
6/3/24, 2:24 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I am ____________, a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in Zimbabwe, where tuition fees range from ZWL 650,000 to ZWL 750,000 per term. When considering the yearly cost, including food and accommodation, it exceeds $2,100 in our beloved Zimbabwe.

Today, the internet is a necessity, and I truly realized its importance when preparing for my journey to India. We are all well aware of the expenses we have to bear just to access subpar internet services. During my school days, I used to spend a minimum of $35-$40 a month to ensure I had sufficient internet, which added up to around $450-$500 annually. It's remarkable to discover that in India, students value their educational infrastructure so much that they can access a necessity like the internet for around $40 for the entire year.

Conversely, when speaking to my seniors in Zimbabwe, I realized that I might have to compromise on my choice of course due to limited available seats. Furthermore, many seniors are struggling with unemployment after graduating in Zimbabwe.

I had a strong desire to support my family through part-time employment during my course, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn between $50 and $100 per month throughout the course.

While pursuing tertiary education in India is more affordable than universities in Zimbabwe, it comes with its own challenges. I diligently followed the 5'S, which played a crucial role in helping me qualify for this scholarship. I urge you to go through these Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors will ask you questions based on the information in the flyer I have attached

Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!
6/3/24, 2:24 PM - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
6/3/24, 2:46 PM - +263 78 723 1295: Oky noted and understood
6/3/24, 2:49 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Along with this share the following information ABOUT Edoofa with them:

 Let me introduce you to the scholarship program that is providing me an opportunity to fulfill all my dreams related to higher education - EDOOFA -Education For All.
6/3/24, 2:49 PM - Aditi Edoofa: To give you an insight about Edoofa, it is a scholarship program initiated by *Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd., INDIA*. Edoofa believes quality education should be accessible to all and not just the privilege of a few. Through our scholarship program that is based on a work-study model, Edoofa solves both problems, that of *lack of affordability and of employability in higher education.* Edoofa stays with the students throughout their academic life as mentor and caretaker, right from building the application, applying to colleges, training, and making them job-ready. This is an experience that I acknowledge as being a Proud Edoofian!🎉
6/3/24, 2:49 PM - Aditi Edoofa: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, Edoofa has worked with 250+ Universities in India and has a community of *more than 3000 students* from different countries📍
 
Edoofa receives applications from _South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries_. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 2100 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just *affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven* so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains

7/3/24, 1:34 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Good afternoon on this beautiful day!
Hope you are well.

Are you ready for today's session?🚀
7/3/24, 1:35 PM - +263 78 723 1295: Yes please 😍☺️
7/3/24, 1:36 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
7/3/24, 1:36 PM - Aditi Edoofa: You know, Edoofa is also working closely in collaboration with the Zimbabwean Ambassador to India Dr. G.M Chipare. We have had meetings where Dr. Chipare has recommended the Program offer Scholarships to 10000 Zimbabweans within 3 years. Herewith I have attached the photo from our meetings with him.
7/3/24, 1:36 PM - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
7/3/24, 1:46 PM - +263 78 723 1295: Ohh that is so wonderful and great indeed
7/3/24, 1:51 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Now, we’ve come to the end of one part of your onboarding of EWYL. So, I want you to go through this conversation quickly- and highlight any areas, questions, or projects that you may have even the slightest concern with- and let’s resolve them before we move on!
7/3/24, 2:06 PM - +263 78 723 1295: So far so good all went well throughout our conversations
7/3/24, 2:11 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Awesome!
7/3/24, 2:11 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how you can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-
1. Give your best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss your EWYL sessions without informing your mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share your challenges and the things you’re good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make your mentor trust you fully
7/3/24, 2:18 PM - +263 78 723 1295: Thank you and l promise to stick to that for earning my scholarship credits
7/3/24, 2:21 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Awesome!
7/3/24, 2:21 PM - Aditi Edoofa: So here are a few more important points that I would like to share with you regarding the projects.
There is no deadline for the project.
There is no order in which you have to do the project.
There is no limit on how much you have to do a project.
There is no limit to the number of scholarship credits one can earn through projects.
It's simple, the *more you work on it, the more scholarship credits you earn.*
Moreover, it is important *that you make steady progress every day*.
7/3/24, 3:00 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Shalom , this concludes our initial orientation. I trust that you've gained valuable insights and anticipate that there will be more to come as we progress toward achieving great success. And I will share the new schedule shortly for your sessions, all the best for your projects
8/3/24, 4:03 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Shalom!
I'm thrilled to get back on track and continue our journey together.
