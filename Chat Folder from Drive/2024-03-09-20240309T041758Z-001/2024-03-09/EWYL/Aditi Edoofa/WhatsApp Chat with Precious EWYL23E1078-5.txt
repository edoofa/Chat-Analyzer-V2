12/1/24, 1:34 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Well, I can see that there is someone else who has joined the group besides you. May I learn a little about them? I would appreciate it if we could engage in a quick conversation and get to know each other a bit.
12/1/24, 1:36 PM - +263 78 724 4398: That was my mother , she is a sells lady and a mother of three including I and two other siblings after me
12/1/24, 1:36 PM - Aditi Edoofa: It's great to connect with her! I extend a warm welcome to her for the exciting and incredible EWYL journey.
12/1/24, 1:38 PM - +263 78 724 4398: Thank you
12/1/24, 1:38 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I would like to begin this journey by knowing you beyond the _Statement of Purpose._ Can you share with me what are your long-term goals and how do you think this EWYL Program will help you in achieving them?
12/1/24, 1:41 PM - +263 78 724 4398: My long term goals are to graduate from university and get a professional paying job ....the EWYL program will help me in Aiding my tuition fees hence making my education cost bearable
12/1/24, 1:42 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your long-term goals. Graduating from university and securing a professional paying job are excellent aspirations. It's great to hear that you see the EWYL program as a valuable support in achieving these goals by aiding with tuition fees. Education is a powerful tool, and your commitment to making it more accessible is commendable.🚀❤️
12/1/24, 1:43 PM - +263 78 724 4398: Yes ....thank you
12/1/24, 1:52 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
12/1/24, 1:55 PM - +263 78 724 4398: Affordable but quality education
12/1/24, 1:56 PM - +263 78 724 4398: I am not sure of the second
12/1/24, 1:58 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
12/1/24, 1:58 PM - Aditi Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
12/1/24, 2:01 PM - +263 78 724 4398: Understood
12/1/24, 2:03 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skillset through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
12/1/24, 2:05 PM - +263 78 724 4398: I am pleased to meet them
12/1/24, 2:05 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Awesome, I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
12/1/24, 2:08 PM - +263 78 724 4398: Yes it does
12/1/24, 2:08 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 10 minutes should be enough.

12/1/24, 2:28 PM - +263 78 724 4398: Indeed it is ....I would love for that to be me some day
12/1/24, 2:28 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Awesome!

How does that sound?

12/1/24, 2:32 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I would like to ask you a few questions to understand how much from our discussion you could retain and if there is anything for us to discuss again.

I will be appearing for my A Level (Year):-

Preferred year of Admission:- 
(August 2024 or August 2025)
20/1/24, 1:54 PM - Aditi Edoofa: And #2 – Back to the exciting part- your *Scholarship Credits*. So, here’s a quick recap of what’s the opportunity for you here-
 1. For every student that enrolls in our Edoofa Program and pays the first part of the enrolment fee, you will be awarded *$20 worth of Scholarship credits*.
2. Similarly, upon completing the Admission Formalities of the university à you will be awarded *$30 worth of Scholarship credits*.
3. There is an additional opportunity to earn $5 worth of Scholarship credits by connecting with students to provide clarity to them about the Edoofa Scholarship, which the Edoofa team will share with you!
20/1/24, 1:54 PM - +263 78 724 4398: Okay noted
20/1/24, 1:55 PM - Aditi Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
20/1/24, 1:55 PM - Aditi Edoofa: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*
  
*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME*
For eg: In your case, it will be-
*PRECIOUS/ADITI*
20/1/24, 1:55 PM - +263 78 724 4398: So I have a question....am I starting these projects right away?
20/1/24, 1:55 PM - Aditi Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
20/1/24, 1:56 PM - Aditi Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)

Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
20/1/24, 1:56 PM - Aditi Edoofa: ADD MENTOR:

Make sure that before you start interacting with the participants in the group that you created for the community-building project, YOU ADD ME.

The purpose of doing this is that:
- I will be able to track your progress and guide you through learning the networking skill
- I will be able to see the concerns raised by students and we can discuss them accordingly.
- I will be able to see whether the right information has been shared with all the students
20/1/24, 1:58 PM - +263 78 724 4398: Okay noted

20/1/24, 1:59 PM - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
20/1/24, 2:00 PM - +263 78 724 4398: Okay
20/1/24, 2:00 PM - Aditi Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
20/1/24, 2:00 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I am ____________, a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in Zimbabwe, where tuition fees range from ZWL 650,000 to ZWL 750,000 per term. When considering the yearly cost, including food and accommodation, it exceeds $2,100 in our beloved Zimbabwe.

Today, the internet is a necessity, and I truly realized its importance when preparing for my journey to India. We are all well aware of the expenses we have to bear just to access subpar internet services. During my school days, I used to spend a minimum of $35-$40 a month to ensure I had sufficient internet, which added up to around $450-$500 annually. It's remarkable to discover that in India, students value their educational infrastructure so much that they can access a necessity like the internet for around $40 for the entire year.

Conversely, when speaking to my seniors in Zimbabwe, I realized that I might have to compromise on my choice of course due to limited available seats. Furthermore, many seniors are struggling with unemployment after graduating in Zimbabwe.

I had a strong desire to support my family through part-time employment during my course, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn between $50 and $100 per month throughout the course.

While pursuing tertiary education in India is more affordable than universities in Zimbabwe, it comes with its own challenges. I diligently followed the 5'S, which played a crucial role in helping me qualify for this scholarship. I urge you to go through these Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors will ask you questions based on the information in the flyer I have attached

Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

So in such a case, we insist that students to forms a WhatsApp where they add me, Mr. Jyotishman, Ms. Deepali, Mr. Abhinav, and the Headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact from that school. After forming the group they:
1) either ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to specifically add those prospective students who will be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education. After they add, then tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
or
2)ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to share those prospective students' contact details with you, so that you can add them and then educate them about Edoofa. After that, tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them

I believe we are on the same page about the three points of contact and their roles. Feel free to reach out in case you have any queries
29/1/24, 2:08 PM - +263 78 724 4398: I thought you said my admissions officer will be addressing my admission queries
29/1/24, 2:09 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Yes, you are right and it's written your EWYL mentor will *not* be addressing your admission queries
29/1/24, 2:10 PM - +263 78 724 4398: Ohhw okay thank you for the clarification
29/1/24, 2:11 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Sure!
29/1/24, 2:14 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Precious, that concludes our initial orientation. I trust that you've gained valuable insights and anticipate that there will be more to come as we progress toward achieving great success. And I will shortly provide you with the new schedule for the sessions, alright?
29/1/24, 2:15 PM - +263 78 724 4398: Yes that is alright
29/1/24, 2:15 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
7/2/24, 10:22 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Precious, As the countdown to your India journey ticks away, with just a quarter left (approximately 3 to  4 months! 😀) before you step into this new adventure, I understand that the chaos and preparations might be swirling around you. Let's navigate through this excitement together. Here is an amazing opportunity for you as our Founder & CEO Mr. Angad, along with the admission officers and counselors (whom you have only met virtually until now) are coming to Zimbabwe for an exclusive annual meet & greet! Sounds amazing, right? 🤩

With more than 5000 people participating, this meet & greet is going to be truly unique that Harare has ever seen. We present to you a fantastic opportunity for you to ask questions, address your concerns/queries, fast-track your admission process, and gain clarity about your journey to India.🇮🇳
7/2/24, 10:22 AM - Aditi Edoofa: I strongly advise bringing your parents and guardians; they play a vital role in your life journey and education decisions. As you're on the verge of starting your higher education, this event allows them to actively participate, understand the program, and witness the experiences of your senior Edoofians.

Prepare for this adventure! I'm genuinely thrilled that you'll be part of this phenomenal event!✨
To secure your seats, kindly let us know how many seats shall be reserved for you.
7/2/24, 12:51 PM - +263 78 724 4398: Where will it be held?
7/2/24, 1:18 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Precious, it would be held in Harare.
7/2/24, 1:19 PM - +263 78 724 4398: I would have loved to attend but I wouldn't be able to make it..... We'll all be at work
7/2/24, 1:19 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Well, as your mentor I truly appreciate your commitment and effort to attend the event. We understand that travel logistics can sometimes be challenging, and we want to make attending our event as convenient as possible for you but making travel arrangements at such a scale is not possible for us. So, you would be required to make your travel arrangements by yourself. 

However, I want to emphasize that this event is not just a gathering; it's an investment toward your future education. Our founders, who have traveled all the way from India, covering a distance of over 5000 miles, are coming specifically to meet you and share insights about your higher education and numerous opportunities.

So, as your mentor, I would strongly suggest that you make the necessary arrangements and attend the event as it’s going to be a life-changing experience for you. <This message was edited>
