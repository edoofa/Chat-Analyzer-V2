26/2/24, 2:11 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Well, I can see that there is someone else who has joined the group besides you. May I learn a little about them? I would appreciate it if we could engage in a quick conversation and get to know each other a bit.
26/2/24, 2:18 PM - +263 78 483 1208: I did not recently add someone in the group. I only shared the group link to my parents as instructed by the Admission officer.
26/2/24, 2:19 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, noted!
26/2/24, 2:19 PM - Aditi Edoofa: So Runyararo, I would like to begin this journey by knowing you beyond the _Statement of Purpose._ Can you share with me what are your long-term goals and how do you think this EWYL Program will help you in achieving them?
26/2/24, 2:44 PM - +263 78 483 1208: I want to be an Aeronautical Engineer- a specialised field that focuses on the operations of air vehicle particularly that travel in the atmosphere.

26/2/24, 3:01 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Awesome!
27/2/24, 1:31 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Runyararo!
Hope you are well.

Are you ready for the session?💯
27/2/24, 1:32 PM - +263 78 483 1208: Good afternoon Ms Aditi,I am ready for the session
27/2/24, 1:34 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
27/2/24, 1:35 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
27/2/24, 1:43 PM - +263 78 483 1208: No Ms Aditi. You can explain in detail.
27/2/24, 1:44 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
27/2/24, 1:44 PM - Aditi Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
27/2/24, 1:49 PM - +263 78 483 1208: Well Explained Ms Aditi. I have clearly understood the two objectives.
27/2/24, 1:49 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
27/2/24, 1:49 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skillset through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
27/2/24, 1:58 PM - +263 78 483 1208: Thank you for the introductions about my EWYL team. I would like to share my warm greetings to Ms Sanjana and Ms Davi. It's an honour to be in collaboration with the EWYL team.
27/2/24, 2:00 PM - Aditi Edoofa: You're welcome!
27/2/24, 2:01 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
27/2/24, 2:09 PM - +263 78 483 1208: Noted. It sounds intriguing Ms Aditi.
27/2/24, 2:12 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Superb!
27/2/24, 2:12 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 10 minutes should be enough.

28/2/24, 1:48 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
28/2/24, 1:48 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Did you notice the _Edoofa Hall of Inspiration_? I am sure you would one day want yourself to be celebrated in this section, the entire Student community reads this newsletter and it's a great deal to be mentioned by the founder himself, isn't it?
28/2/24, 1:55 PM - +263 78 483 1208: Absolutely great.
28/2/24, 2:05 PM - Aditi Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound?
28/2/24, 2:07 PM - +263 78 483 1208: It sounds incredible Ms Aditi.
28/2/24, 2:19 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
28/2/24, 2:19 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I would like to ask you a few questions to understand how much from our discussion you could retain and if there is anything for us to discuss again.
28/2/24, 2:19 PM - Aditi Edoofa: So here are the questions, answer them in detail:

1. Share a small introduction of everyone on your  EWYL team.
2. What goals has your mentor set for your EWYL journey?
3. How does Mr. Angad Singh, founder of Edoofa, interact with all students?
A. Newsletter       B. Youtube

4. Explain in your own words what the Hall of Inspiration is.
28/2/24, 3:06 PM - Aditi Edoofa: We are concluding today's session. We will reconvene tomorrow for our session.🚀
29/2/24, 1:12 PM - +263 78 483 1208: 1) Firstly there is you Ms Aditi, my EWYL mentor.

You also provide information on the objectives and goals for my EWYL journey.Then secondly l have Ms Sanjana. She is the head of the department. Her role is mainly to supervise all group interactions whenever in need for her guidance.Lastly, l have also Ms Davi, the Head Coach, she will be my mentor as well.She will be mainly an educator about her content and structured syllabus.

2)My mentor actually provided three quality goals and these are:

*Working towards attaining the objective- learning and evolving with the necessary 21st century skillset to prepare for the real world workplace and be helped to grow
*Aiming for a good  academic journey. <This message was edited>
29/2/24, 1:32 PM - +263 78 483 1208: 3) A. Newsletter
4)The Edoofa Hall of Inspiration is a platform for Edoofians to be heard on quality roles there partaking in the social environment concerning social issues like inequities. It is platform meant for us to provide our solutions and give a word of advice to the youth to instill justice , peace and a balanced society. Edoofians use the Hall of Inspiration to give testimonials and their experience since childhood.
The Edoofa Hall of Inspiration is a powerful tool to those in need of assistance and motivation.

1/3/24, 1:48 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Great! So may I have a response now. <This message was edited>
1/3/24, 2:03 PM - +263 78 483 1208: The EWYL program is a fantastic opportunity for gaining relevant 21st century skills. Skills necessary to prepare a student for "jobs of the future".The document listed the required skills and these are emerging skills ,enduring skills and other skills deemed necessary. 
The Edoofa Ewyl program also initiated programs/activities expected for every student. There are three most effective programs and these are corporate alliance, community building and African schools educating reform program. In each of the programs there are certain objectives that must be accomplished for a student to gain  scholarship credits. This helps students to self sponsor and manage their own tuition fee. The programs are very beneficial in boosting networking, self confidence and persistence
1/3/24, 2:42 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Please excuse me for the delay in reply as I was facing some network challenges.
1/3/24, 2:42 PM - Aditi Edoofa: You know what, this is fantastic! This is the kind of comprehension needed in an Edoofian, and voila! You are already so good at it.
1/3/24, 2:42 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Additionally, I want to inform you that at present, the first project is on hold owing to the substantial number of projects and commitments we are currently managing. We are prioritizing our efforts to ensure the successful completion of existing tasks before resuming work on this project. Till that time you may focus on the projects that I am going to explain.
1/3/24, 3:01 PM - +263 78 483 1208: Thank you. Your response has made me happy.
1/3/24, 3:02 PM - +263 78 483 1208: You can proceed
1/3/24, 3:02 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Today's session concludes here.

Hope you are well.

Let's begin with our today's session?🚀 <This message was edited>
7/3/24, 1:37 PM - Aditi Edoofa: *I think we’re ready to move to the community building project!* This project is quite possibly a student favorite! So, now I am going to share an audio file from our mentorship team and you ensure you don’t miss anything in it and use this time to play this audio more than once, let’s get to it!
7/3/24, 1:37 PM - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
7/3/24, 2:03 PM - +263 78 483 1208: I am fine today.
7/3/24, 2:06 PM - +263 78 483 1208: I played the audio more than once. It was quite loaded with information based on community building project. I loved the clarity. It was well explained.
7/3/24, 2:11 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, so very quickly-can you summarize whatever you learned in the audio for me? Just so we’re on the same page about it.
7/3/24, 2:52 PM - +263 78 483 1208: Alright then, let me give just a brief of what l learnt from the audio. The main emphasis was specifically on community building project- one of the task under the EWYL program.   Community building  is one of the major skills for an Edoofian- establishing and reinforcing connection ,relationships and sharing identity within his/ her geographical location and eventually ensuring a supportive and inclusive environment. Through community building, Edoofians are able to socially interact with others in their community giving them an insight of what Edoofa is specifically to secondary students who are in their final year or who recently finished their secondary education. Fortunately this whole process you are guided and supported by the Edoofa team.This initiative is also quite good as it offers scholarship credits if an Edoofian manages to accomplish the objectives. Networking and persuading an individual to be part of the Edoofa's exciting journey is worth its on scholarship credit of about $20. If the individual continues and successfully manage to be admitted by one of the Universities an extra scholarship credit is offered worth $30.
7/3/24, 2:55 PM - Aditi Edoofa: That’s awesome, I’m confident that if you continue to pay attention to the information shared and then respond accordingly, we will make a great team. Now, here are 2 things I’d like to briefly remind you of from the Community Building Project.


1-  I’m sharing a form with you below, you can share that with the students whom you speak with and think that they truly deserve to be an Edoofian and fulfill their dreams of higher education!

Hope you are well.

Are you ready for today's session?
8/3/24, 1:45 PM - +263 78 483 1208: Yes Ms Aditi.
8/3/24, 1:45 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
8/3/24, 1:46 PM - Aditi Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
8/3/24, 1:46 PM - Aditi Edoofa: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*
  
*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME*
For eg: In your case, it will be-
*RUNYARARO/ADITI* <This message was edited>
8/3/24, 1:46 PM - Aditi Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
8/3/24, 1:46 PM - Aditi Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)

Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
8/3/24, 1:46 PM - Aditi Edoofa: *ADD MENTOR:*

Make sure that before you start interacting with the participants in the group that you created for the community-building project, YOU ADD ME.

The purpose of doing this is that:
- I will be able to track your progress and guide you through learning the networking skill
- I will be able to see the concerns raised by students and we can discuss them accordingly.
- I will be able to see whether the right information has been shared with all the students

8/3/24, 1:50 PM - Aditi Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
8/3/24, 1:50 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I am ____________, a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in Zimbabwe, where tuition fees range from ZWL 650,000 to ZWL 750,000 per term. When considering the yearly cost, including food and accommodation, it exceeds $2,100 in our beloved Zimbabwe.

Today, the internet is a necessity, and I truly realized its importance when preparing for my journey to India. We are all well aware of the expenses we have to bear just to access subpar internet services. During my school days, I used to spend a minimum of $35-$40 a month to ensure I had sufficient internet, which added up to around $450-$500 annually. It's remarkable to discover that in India, students value their educational infrastructure so much that they can access a necessity like the internet for around $40 for the entire year.

Conversely, when speaking to my seniors in Zimbabwe, I realized that I might have to compromise on my choice of course due to limited available seats. Furthermore, many seniors are struggling with unemployment after graduating in Zimbabwe.

I had a strong desire to support my family through part-time employment during my course, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn between $50 and $100 per month throughout the course.

While pursuing tertiary education in India is more affordable than universities in Zimbabwe, it comes with its own challenges. I diligently followed the 5'S, which played a crucial role in helping me qualify for this scholarship. I urge you to go through these Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors will ask you questions based on the information in the flyer I have attached

Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

 Let me introduce you to the scholarship program that is providing me an opportunity to fulfill all my dreams related to higher education - EDOOFA -Education For All.
8/3/24, 2:01 PM - Aditi Edoofa: To give you an insight about Edoofa, it is a scholarship program initiated by *Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd., INDIA*. Edoofa believes quality education should be accessible to all and not just the privilege of a few.

This is an experience that I acknowledge as being a Proud Edoofian!🎉
8/3/24, 2:01 PM - Aditi Edoofa: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees.

8/3/24, 2:05 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Now, we’ve come to the end of one part of your onboarding of EWYL. So, I want you to go through this conversation quickly- and highlight any areas, questions, or projects that you may have even the slightest concern with- and let’s resolve them before we move on!
8/3/24, 2:11 PM - +263 78 483 1208: All my questions are  clearly answered.
8/3/24, 2:13 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
8/3/24, 2:13 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how you can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-
1. Give your best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss your EWYL sessions without informing your mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share your challenges and the things you’re good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make your mentor trust you fully

8/3/24, 2:17 PM - Aditi Edoofa: So here are a few more important points that I would like to share with you regarding the projects.
There is no deadline for the project.
There is no order in which you have to do the project.
There is no limit on how much you have to do a project.
There is no limit to the number of scholarship credits one can earn through projects.
It's simple, the *more you work on it, the more scholarship credits you earn.*
Moreover, it is important *that you make steady progress every day*.
