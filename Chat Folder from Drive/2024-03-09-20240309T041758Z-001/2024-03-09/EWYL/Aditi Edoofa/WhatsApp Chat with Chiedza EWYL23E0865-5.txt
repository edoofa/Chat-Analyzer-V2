26/12/23, 11:11 AM - Aditi Edoofa: @263787790133 May I know the reason for your absence in today's session?
27/12/23, 8:31 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Happy Wednesday!🌻
Hope you are well.

So let's dive into our session🚀
27/12/23, 8:35 AM - +263 78 779 0133: I am sorry for yesterday  had some family emergency...so I wasn't online
27/12/23, 8:35 AM - +263 78 779 0133: Yes I am doing well ...let's continue
27/12/23, 8:38 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, I hope everything is okay?
27/12/23, 8:44 AM - +263 78 779 0133: Yeah...it is now
27/12/23, 8:44 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
27/12/23, 8:45 AM - Aditi Edoofa: There are a few more skills that the entire EWYL team and myself believe can add immense value to your holistic growth and give you an additional opportunity to earn, while simultaneously interacting with live projects!

*So, are you excited to find out what this is?*
27/12/23, 8:47 AM - +263 78 779 0133: Yes I am
27/12/23, 8:49 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Edoofa took it upon itself to have Edoofians interact with Live and Real-time projects. This was only possible when we onboarded our future employment partners to give us access to projects for our students!
 Now, as I was mentioning, TEAM EWYL and I want you to learn the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely included research, content writing, SEO, digital marketing, creative content, influencer marketing, social media engagement, blog writing – just to name a few.
27/12/23, 8:49 AM - +263 78 779 0133: Okay
27/12/23, 8:51 AM - Aditi Edoofa: So here is a brief about these terms:


Research: Thorough research forms the foundation of our work, ensuring accuracy and credibility in every piece of content we produce.

Content Writing: Our team excels in crafting engaging and informative content that resonates with our target audience, conveying our messages effectively.

SEO (Search Engine Optimization): Implementing effective SEO strategies ensures that our content reaches a wider online audience, improving visibility and engagement.

Digital Marketing: Through strategic digital marketing initiatives, we're expanding our reach and creating meaningful connections with our audience across various online platforms.

Creative Content: We're committed to delivering content that stands out – creative, original, and valuable, leaving a lasting impact on our audience.

Influencer Marketing: Collaborating with influencers allows us to tap into their engaged followers, enhancing our brand's credibility and outreach.

Social Media Engagement: Actively engaging on social media platforms fosters a sense of community, encourages conversations, and keeps our audience connected.

Blog Writing: Our blogs serve as a platform to share in-depth insights, industry trends, and valuable information that our readers find valuable.
27/12/23, 8:52 AM - +263 78 779 0133: Okay
27/12/23, 8:54 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how you can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-
1. Give your best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss your EWYL sessions without informing your mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share your challenges and the things you’re good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make your mentor trust you fully
27/12/23, 8:57 AM - Aditi Edoofa: There are a few additional things that are required for you to be selected for a project. I want you to share the following with me
1. Instagram Username
2. Facebook Username
3. A smiling photo of yours ✨ 
→ IN case you do not have an Instagram/Facebook account- I want you to create one, and then send it in the next 24-36 hours.
27/12/23, 8:58 AM - +263 78 779 0133: Okay
27/12/23, 8:59 AM - Aditi Edoofa: So now we are ready to begin our new journey.
Please note a few things:
FIRST- Please choose your batch for your sessions. Either it has to be 
*MONDAY and THURSDAY*
or 
*TUESDAY and FRIDAY*
27/12/23, 9:01 AM - +263 78 779 0133: I guess Tuesday and Friday  is okay
27/12/23, 9:03 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, noted.
27/12/23, 9:03 AM - Aditi Edoofa: SECOND- In our sessions (that will be happening on the days you will choose), we will discuss the weekend activity or the Wednesday lesson plus the projects and the newsletter.
27/12/23, 9:03 AM - Aditi Edoofa: THIRD- All our conversations from now on will take forward in the EWYL Line.
27/12/23, 9:04 AM - Aditi Edoofa: EWYL Line.vcf (file attached)
27/12/23, 9:04 AM - Aditi Edoofa: FOURTH- You have to come on the EWYL Line and say 'Greetings, Ms. Aditi, I am <NAME> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....'
27/12/23, 9:04 AM - Aditi Edoofa: FIFTH- Every day you have to come and say *"I am a proud EDOOFIAN'* on the EWYL line.
27/12/23, 9:04 AM - Aditi Edoofa: It serves as a link between every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that most of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.
27/12/23, 9:05 AM - +263 78 779 0133: Okay
27/12/23, 9:08 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Your session is on Tuesday and Friday from 09:30-11:00 AM. In your session, you are required to:
▪️Active participation in most of the sessions by being punctual and actively engaging in the discussions
▪️Follow the daily ritual of saying 'I am a proud Edoofian' on the EWYL Line every day, every morning before 12 PM.
▪️Share your lesson and activity response before your session commences
▪️Sharing project updates
27/12/23, 9:08 AM - Aditi Edoofa: So here are a few more important points that I would like to share with you regarding the projects.
There is no deadline for the project.
There is no order in which you have to do the project.
There is no limit on how much you have to do a project.
There is no limit to the number of scholarship credits one can earn through projects.
It's simple, the *more you work on it, the more scholarship credits you earn.*
Moreover, it is important *that you make steady progress every day*.
27/12/23, 9:10 AM - +263 78 779 0133: Okay
27/12/23, 9:11 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Chiedza, that concludes our initial orientation. I trust that you've gained valuable insights and anticipate that there will be more to come as we progress towards achieving great success. Our next point of contact will be on the EWYL Line during your scheduled sessions and will follow the Proud Edoofian ritual daily.
27/12/23, 9:13 AM - +263 78 779 0133: Okay
29/12/23, 10:08 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Greetings @263787790133 
Hope you are well

I am waiting for you at the EWYL Line. Follow the PROUD EDOOFIAN ritual on the EWYL line to begin your session. Make sure to incorporate it into your daily routine.🕛
29/12/23, 3:00 PM - Aditi Edoofa: As we are going to embark on a new chapter at the dawn of the New Year, I wanted to take a moment to send my warmest wishes your way. May this coming year be filled with joy, laughter, and moments of profound happiness. 🌈

Along with you, the Edoofa Family will also be occupied in *New Year Celebrations from tomorrow till 1 January 2024* and we will *resume from 2 January onwards*🎉

Wishing you a year ahead filled with love, prosperity, and the fulfillment of your heart's desires. May every day be a chance for you to shine and make a positive impact. ✨

5/1/24, 3:53 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Please follow it daily, okay?
5/1/24, 10:18 PM - +263 78 779 0133: Yes
6/1/24, 1:36 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Hello Chiedza

I wanted to share some exciting news with all of you. As you may have noticed, my schedule has been quite packed lately due to work commitments. The reason behind this is something truly special – our team has organized a three-day long industrial visit called *SLICE CON' 24* for our Indian Edoofians! 🚀

During this event, *we are fortunate to have the Co-founders and CEOs of prominent brands* who will be present and sharing their invaluable experiences in one-on-one sessions. Yes, you read that right – they will be there live, right in front of us! What's even more thrilling is that a few of *our students are presenting a presentation directly to these CEOs*, showcasing why Africa, your homeland, is the best market for their products. 🤝
6/1/24, 1:36 PM - Aditi Edoofa: While I am filled with excitement for this event, please note that due to my involvement in the visit on the *8th, 9th, and 10th of January*, our regular sessions won't be taking place on these days. When we connect on the 11th of January, I'll share my students' experiences and pictures with you. 📸✨
6/1/24, 3:42 PM - +263 78 779 0133: Oolk...Ms Tushti...so my next session is on the 11thof January??
11/1/24, 3:31 PM - +263 77 277 0177: Good afternoon,  l am parent to Joice and she is now back at Chibuwe high school to do her U6. There may be communication breakdown because the school is running without power and hence no WiFi.  Liason will have to be done through the HOD ICT to utilise the school ICT facility with a power back up to communicate with Edoofa team. We hope Mr Maposa will come to our rescue.
11/1/24, 4:19 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Hellooooo!!!!

I quickly just wanted to share the scoop on *Slice Con'24—it was seriously awesome!* The event was nothing short of extraordinary, providing students with a wealth of exposure and valuable insights. 🚀
Throughout the event, students actively engaged with CEOs, asking insightful questions and gaining a deeper understanding of various industries. The *AI sessions* were particularly enlightening, offering a glimpse into the cutting-edge advancements in technology and some amazing AI Tools🤖

But wait, there's more! They also played games and made some great memories. It was a total win-win—fun and educational at the same time. Here is a glimpse of how it went, looking forward to when you will also get this chance to be here and experience these amazing things🤩❤️

I have been expecting to hear from you for the past couple of days, but I can see you have not been able to get back to me due to certain reasons I am not aware of. You see, I was looking forward to having you at the event as I know how beneficial it is going to be for you. Most of my students have already quite enthusiastically reserved seats for themselves and their family and friends.

Is everything alright? Are you facing any challenges? Is there something you'd like to share?

9/2/24, 2:44 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Good Afternoon!
Hope you are well.

Sure, but I am afraid that this is an offline event, so you would have to be present there to be a part of it.
14/2/24, 6:53 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Hi,Joice Chiedza Masanzi.! 

Warm greetings from India! While we would like to believe you might be dreaming of visiting us soon, we couldn't wait any longer to meet you!

8/3/24, 5:05 PM - +263 77 277 0177: Good afternoon,  am Joice's father. Unfortunately the school authorities at Chibuwe where Joice is a full tym boarding learner has issued a notice that learners are no longer allowed to use cellphones.  Henceforth all communication should now be directed to me. Alternatively if Edoofa has the power it can liaise with the school authorities to allow Edoofa learners to be given opportunity to use cellphones
