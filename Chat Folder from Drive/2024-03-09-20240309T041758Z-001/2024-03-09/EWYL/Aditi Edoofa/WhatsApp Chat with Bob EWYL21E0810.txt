Bob, guess what? I'm super excited to share some awesome news – next month, we're planning a trip to Africa! 🌍 Yep, you heard it right! Our team is coming to your town. Just like last year, our students will be helping us organize the event, and we're looking for volunteers to join in and help manage everything! 🙌

Trust me, it's going to be an amazing experience with lots to learn! 🌈 Since planning this big event takes proper time and effort, our team will be occupied so tight. Therefore, I was thinking of connecting only once a week for the time being.

Therefore, your new session timing will be *Every Tuesday, 9:30 a.m*. ⏰

Can't wait for this adventure together! 🚀
23/1/24, 9:44 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Good Morning on this beautiful day!✨
Hope you are well.

I am Ms. Aditi, your EWYL mentor at Edoofa! I hope you are having a great time and you are doing well in your academic journey. 
While I was going through your conversation, It reminded me of how I started my education journey full of questions and aspirations, and therefore I wanted to check in and have a conversation about how you are doing currently. Have you started with your higher educational journey?
