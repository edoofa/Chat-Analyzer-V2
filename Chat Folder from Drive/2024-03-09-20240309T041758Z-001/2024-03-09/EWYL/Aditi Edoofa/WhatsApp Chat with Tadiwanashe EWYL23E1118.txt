Team Edoofa experienced a whirlwind over the past three days, with activities bustling in both India and Harare for the Meet and Greet '24 event. After a brief moment to collect ourselves, we're ready to return to our original schedule and move forward in our journey. 
*Our session will commence today at 8:30 AM.*
22/2/24, 8:28 AM - Aditi Edoofa: So let's begin with today's session🚀
22/2/24, 9:35 AM - Aditi Edoofa: @263717351885 @27729470473 May I know why Tadiwanashe didn't show up for today's session?
22/2/24, 3:42 PM - +27 72 947 0473: Goodday..Tadiwanashe failed to attend although she had a representative because she is currently at a boarding school far away from Harare..so with the short notice logistically it was a hustle ...considering again the network challenges caused by power shortages.
22/2/24, 4:00 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Good day! 
Hope you are doing well.

Thank you for letting us know. I understand that Tadiwanashe couldn't attend the event in person due to being at a boarding school far from Harare. Logistically, it can be challenging, especially with short notice and network issues caused by power shortages.
22/2/24, 4:10 PM - +27 72 947 0473: Thank you maam
26/2/24, 8:37 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Happy Monday!🌺
Hope you are well.

Are you ready for the session?💯
26/2/24, 9:37 AM - Aditi Edoofa: @263717351885 @27729470473 I noticed you missed the session again, and I wanted to check in to make sure everything is okay. It's important to attend these sessions as your contributions are valued. If there are any issues preventing your attendance, please inform me. Your presence is crucial, and I expect your participation moving forward
26/2/24, 10:01 AM - +263 71 735 1885: Sometimes l will be in class lessons so it will be hard for me to participate as phones are not allowed during classes
26/2/24, 10:34 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, may I know if you would be available from 1:30 PM to 2:30 PM for our sessions.
26/2/24, 1:45 PM - +27 72 947 0473: Goodday ma'am..yes I missed the first part because of work maam
26/2/24, 2:25 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I understand, so may I know which time suits you better for your sessions?
26/2/24, 2:31 PM - +27 72 947 0473: I understand Tadiwanashe will be done with school waiting for study from 4pm and her mother finishes work at4 pm so I think 4pm  is more convenient
26/2/24, 2:43 PM - Aditi Edoofa: @27729470473 I am afraid that I won't be able to accommodate that time as it does not align with me working hours.
26/2/24, 2:45 PM - +27 72 947 0473: What time is convenient to you
26/2/24, 2:47 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I have two batches one id from 8:30 AM to 9:30 AM CAT and the other batch is from 1:30 PM to 2:30 PM CAT.
26/2/24, 2:49 PM - +27 72 947 0473: 1:30  to 2:30 PM is better
26/2/24, 3:01 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, great.
So from now on our sessions will be held at this time, looking forward to our sessions.
26/2/24, 3:25 PM - +27 72 947 0473: Thank you
27/2/24, 1:30 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Tadiwanashe!
Hope you are well.

Are you ready for the session?💯
27/2/24, 1:35 PM - +27 72 947 0473: Goodday
27/2/24, 1:35 PM - +27 72 947 0473: We are ready
27/2/24, 1:36 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
27/2/24, 1:36 PM - Aditi Edoofa: So Tadiwanashe, I would like to begin this journey by knowing you beyond the _Statement of Purpose._ Can you share with me what are your long-term goals and how do you think this EWYL Program will help you in achieving them?
27/2/24, 1:49 PM - +27 72 947 0473: I would love to be own a law firm so that I will be able to help other disadvantaged people in my community so as assisting my parents financially. EWYL will help me to lighten the load my parents have by paying for my own tuition
27/2/24, 1:49 PM - Aditi Edoofa: That's a wonderful aspiration! Owning a law firm would not only enable you to make a positive impact by assisting disadvantaged individuals in your community but also provide financial support to your parents. Participating in EWYL sounds like a great step towards achieving your goals, as it will help alleviate the financial burden on your parents by covering your tuition expenses. Keep working hard towards your dreams, and I'm sure you'll achieve them!
27/2/24, 1:50 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
27/2/24, 1:52 PM - +27 72 947 0473: Not yet maam
27/2/24, 1:52 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
27/2/24, 1:52 PM - Aditi Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
27/2/24, 2:34 PM - Aditi Edoofa: We are concluding today's session. We will reconvene tomorrow for our session.🚀
27/2/24, 2:40 PM - +27 72 947 0473: Thank you
28/2/24, 1:39 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Happy Wednesday!✨

28/2/24, 2:59 PM - +27 72 947 0473: Sorry ma'am I had challenges with my power this side ma'am
28/2/24, 2:59 PM - +27 72 947 0473: My apologies but we are sorted now

29/2/24, 1:33 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Good Afternoon!☀️
Hope you are well.

Are you ready for the session?🚀
29/2/24, 1:58 PM - +27 72 947 0473: Good afternoon now
29/2/24, 2:11 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skillset through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
29/2/24, 2:12 PM - +27 72 947 0473: Thank you
29/2/24, 2:20 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
29/2/24, 2:33 PM - +27 72 947 0473: Very interesting
29/2/24, 2:48 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 10 minutes should be enough.

1/3/24, 2:40 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Did you notice the _Edoofa Hall of Inspiration_? I am sure you would one day want yourself to be celebrated in this section, the entire Student community reads this newsletter and it's a great deal to be mentioned by the founder himself, isn't it?

8/3/24, 1:55 PM - Aditi Edoofa: And #2 – Back to the exciting part- your *Scholarship Credits*. So, here’s a quick recap of what’s the opportunity for you here-
 1. For every student that enrolls in our Edoofa Program and pays the first part of the enrolment fee, you will be awarded *$20 worth of Scholarship credits*.
2. Similarly, upon completing the Admission Formalities of the university à you will be awarded *$30 worth of Scholarship credits*.
3. There is an additional opportunity to earn $5 worth of Scholarship credits by connecting with students to provide clarity to them about the Edoofa Scholarship, which the Edoofa team will share with you!
8/3/24, 1:57 PM - +27 72 947 0473: Thank I will go through it
8/3/24, 1:57 PM - Aditi Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
8/3/24, 1:57 PM - Aditi Edoofa: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*
  
*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME*
For eg: In your case, it will be-
*TADIWANASHE/ADITI*
8/3/24, 1:57 PM - +27 72 947 0473: Ok thank you
8/3/24, 1:58 PM - Aditi Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
8/3/24, 1:58 PM - Aditi Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)
8/3/24, 1:58 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
8/3/24, 1:58 PM - Aditi Edoofa: *ADD MENTOR:*

Make sure that before you start interacting with the participants in the group that you created for the community-building project, YOU ADD ME.

The purpose of doing this is that:
- I will be able to track your progress and guide you through learning the networking skill
- I will be able to see the concerns raised by students and we can discuss them accordingly.
- I will be able to see whether the right information has been shared with all the students <This message was edited>

 Let me introduce you to the scholarship program that is providing me an opportunity to fulfill all my dreams related to higher education - EDOOFA -Education For All.
8/3/24, 2:02 PM - Aditi Edoofa: To give you an insight about Edoofa, it is a scholarship program initiated by *Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd., INDIA*. Edoofa believes quality education should be accessible to all and not just the privilege of a few. Through our scholarship program that is based on a work-study model, Edoofa solves both problems, that of *lack of affordability and of employability in higher education.* Edoofa stays with the students throughout their academic life as mentor and caretaker, right from building the application, applying to colleges, training, and making them job-ready. This is an experience that I acknowledge as being a Proud Edoofian!🎉
8/3/24, 2:02 PM - Aditi Edoofa: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, Edoofa has worked with 250+ Universities in India and has a community of *more than 3000 students* from different countries📍
 
Edoofa receives applications from _South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries_. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 2100 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just *affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven* so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains
