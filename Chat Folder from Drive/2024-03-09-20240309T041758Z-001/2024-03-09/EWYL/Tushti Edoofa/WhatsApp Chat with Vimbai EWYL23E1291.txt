27/2/24, 3:07 PM - Tushti Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well.

The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
27/2/24, 4:10 PM - +263 71 838 9027: No
27/2/24, 4:10 PM - Tushti Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
27/2/24, 4:11 PM - Tushti Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
27/2/24, 4:12 PM - +263 71 838 9027: Ok , I get you very well
27/2/24, 4:13 PM - Tushti Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skillset through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
27/2/24, 4:14 PM - +263 71 838 9027: Ok , thank you very much madam. I will be glad to work with them.
27/2/24, 4:15 PM - Tushti Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
27/2/24, 4:17 PM - +263 71 838 9027: Yes very interesting

28/2/24, 2:17 PM - Tushti Edoofa: Great to hear!
28/2/24, 2:17 PM - Tushti Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 10 minutes should be enough.

28/2/24, 2:28 PM - Tushti Edoofa: So may I know which section from the newsletter you *liked the most*, personally for me, it is very difficult to tell, each section has its taste and interest.
28/2/24, 2:29 PM - +263 71 838 9027: The section which had three quotes and the sections which students where telling about what they do anda their talents
28/2/24, 2:31 PM - Tushti Edoofa: That is amazing Vimbai.
28/2/24, 2:31 PM - Tushti Edoofa: Did you notice the _Edoofa Hall of Inspiration_? I am sure you would one day want yourself to be celebrated in this section, the entire Student community reads this newsletter and it's a great deal to be mentioned by the founder himself, isn't it?

28/2/24, 2:49 PM - +263 71 838 9027: This sounds great
28/2/24, 2:50 PM - Tushti Edoofa: I enjoyed our conversation, I am certain, you would have a better understanding of what your EWYL journey is going to look like, full of knowledge and opportunities to grow and develop yourself. Before we end our discussion for the day,I would like to ask you a few questions to understand how much from today’s discussion you could retain and if there is anything for us to discuss again.*Are you ready for the questions?*

1/3/24, 2:25 PM - +263 71 838 9027: The document describes about how the EWYL program will assist the students  . From the document I've understood about the Awareness, skills and the skills that are Emerging   ..Awareness is being able to know about upcoming events and how they will affect the business environment positively and negatively.i also understood about acquiring skills . I learnt that being aware is not enough but acquiring the skills on how to run the business process is also required .These skills should be in line with the goals to be attained in the future .I also caught up with the statement which says , skills that are Emerging, skills are emerging due to various outbreaks like the coronavirus pandemic that hit the a number of countries in the past . This pandemic caused most business to be held  online .for example some meetings had to be done on video calls or zoom calls . Some skills that are emerging are online digital skills, online content creative writing, Data analytics and remote teamwork. Then there were to projects shown , namely corporate alliances and community networking . Both projects have the primary outcome, the skill set and the mindset outcomes .
1/3/24, 2:28 PM - Tushti Edoofa: Great Job Vimbai! The document has multiple projects that you are assigned to do. The EWYL program will help you acquire skills such as Awareness, literacy and Digital skills, Social media literacy, Data analysis, and Remote team working amongst other skills that will help you acquire. These skills will help you become employable whenever you approach the job.
1/3/24, 2:28 PM - Tushti Edoofa: I will start by explaining the projects in detail. I am sharing an audio file with you. Here’s my suggestion- listen to it at least twice, you know- to make sure we don’t miss anything out, and then get back to me when you are finished with the process!
1/3/24, 2:29 PM - Tushti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
1/3/24, 2:37 PM - +263 71 838 9027: Thank you I've understood
1/3/24, 2:38 PM - Tushti Edoofa: Okay, so very quickly-can you summarize whatever you learned in the audio for me? Just so we’re on the same page about it.
1/3/24, 2:42 PM - +263 71 838 9027: The audio explains about the corporate alliance that it is a project that assists people by doing Business online . The objective of this project is to undersign the market to be effective in the future and the community networking helps to communicate and discuss the business with individuals through LinkedIn. This application helps to communicate with individuals for business purposes.

I am sure that you must have had a chance to go through the conversations that I had with Vimbai until now and that must have given you a certain clarity towards the program.

4/3/24, 1:56 PM - Tushti Edoofa: And #2 – Back to the exciting part- your *Scholarship Credits*. So, here’s a quick recap of what’s the opportunity for you here-
 1. For every student that enrolls in our Edoofa Program and pays the first part of the enrolment fee, you will be awarded *$20 worth of Scholarship credits*.
2. Similarly, upon completing the Admission Formalities of the university à you will be awarded *$30 worth of Scholarship credits*.
3. There is an additional opportunity to earn $5 worth of Scholarship credits by connecting with students to provide clarity to them about the Edoofa Scholarship, which the Edoofa team will share with you!
4/3/24, 2:02 PM - +263 71 838 9027: Ok I get you
4/3/24, 2:03 PM - Tushti Edoofa: Perfect Vimbai!
4/3/24, 2:03 PM - Tushti Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
4/3/24, 2:04 PM - +263 71 838 9027: Ok
4/3/24, 2:06 PM - Tushti Edoofa: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*
4/3/24, 2:06 PM - +263 71 838 9027: Should I share with the students as of now
4/3/24, 2:06 PM - Tushti Edoofa: *STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME*
For eg: In your case, it will be-
*VIMBAI/JULIA*
4/3/24, 2:07 PM - +263 71 838 9027: Ok
4/3/24, 2:08 PM - Tushti Edoofa: Yes you can share, but before that let me share some more information with you, so that it will be much effective for you.
4/3/24, 2:10 PM - +263 71 838 9027: Ok madam
4/3/24, 2:11 PM - Tushti Edoofa: Okay
4/3/24, 2:12 PM - Tushti Edoofa: Moving on with this.
4/3/24, 2:12 PM - Tushti Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
4/3/24, 2:12 PM - +263 71 838 9027: Ok
4/3/24, 2:12 PM - Tushti Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)

Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
4/3/24, 2:12 PM - Tushti Edoofa: Make sure that before you start interacting with the participants in the group that you created for the community-building project, YOU ADD ME.

The purpose of doing this is that:
- I will be able to track your progress and guide you through learning the networking skill
- I will be able to see the concerns raised by students and we can discuss them accordingly.
- I will be able to see whether the right information has been shared with all the students

4/3/24, 2:14 PM - Tushti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
4/3/24, 2:15 PM - Tushti Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
4/3/24, 2:15 PM - Tushti Edoofa: I am ____________, a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in Zimbabwe, where tuition fees range from ZWL 650,000 to ZWL 750,000 per term. When considering the yearly cost, including food and accommodation, it exceeds $2,100 in our beloved Zimbabwe.

Today, the internet is a necessity, and I truly realized its importance when preparing for my journey to India. We are all well aware of the expenses we have to bear just to access subpar internet services. During my school days, I used to spend a minimum of $35-$40 a month to ensure I had sufficient internet, which added up to around $450-$500 annually. It's remarkable to discover that in India, students value their educational infrastructure so much that they can access a necessity like the internet for around $40 for the entire year.

Conversely, when speaking to my seniors in Zimbabwe, I realized that I might have to compromise on my choice of course due to limited available seats. Furthermore, many seniors are struggling with unemployment after graduating in Zimbabwe.

I had a strong desire to support my family through part-time employment during my course, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn between $50 and $100 per month throughout the course.

While pursuing tertiary education in India is more affordable than universities in Zimbabwe, it comes with its own challenges. I diligently followed the 5'S, which played a crucial role in helping me qualify for this scholarship. I urge you to go through these Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors will ask you questions based on the information in the flyer I have attached

Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

May I know if you have the Whatsapp contact of the School Head whom you want us to reach out to? And if not I would suggest you find it today so that we can move ahead soon.
There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to any teacher or student at School with whom you are in touch and ask him/her for your School Head’s Contact.
5/3/24, 1:47 PM - +263 71 838 9027: This might be difficult as Im no longer in the area as I've said above ..I've no access
5/3/24, 1:52 PM - Tushti Edoofa: I understand Vimbai! but you can contact your friends or teachers and ask them the School Heads number.

5/3/24, 2:02 PM - Tushti Edoofa: Alright Vimbai! To help you ease out the process, we could do a small activity. Why don't you share the list of at least 8-10 schools in your area.
5/3/24, 2:03 PM - Tushti Edoofa: So that you can connect with the other school heads which are near to you.
5/3/24, 2:03 PM - Tushti Edoofa: I can help you identify the ones that are partnered with us.  This will help us save the resolution time and you can go about connecting with the headmasters of the schools that are yet to be connected with us.

5/3/24, 2:50 PM - Tushti Edoofa: Now that you have the School Head’s Contact, It is time for us to reach out to the school head in a professional manner. With poor communication, it's easy for messages to get misunderstood. By mastering the professional touch, the potential for misunderstandings occurring can be minimized.

The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career.
5/3/24, 2:50 PM - Tushti Edoofa: So, This is what the First message should look like:_

5/3/24, 3:02 PM - Tushti Edoofa: When the school’s per-term fees are less than $100, we do not get a school call done by Edoofa's Program Director.
The reason behind this is that it is very much doubt that the students from this school will or will not be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education.
So in such a case, we insist that students to form a WhatsApp where they can add me, Mr. Jyotishman, Ms. Deepali, Mr. Abhinav, and the Headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact from that school. After forming the group they:
1) either ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to specifically add those prospective students who will be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education. After they add, then tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
or
2)ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to share those prospective students' contact details with you, so that you can add them and then educate them about Edoofa. After that, tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them

7/3/24, 12:20 PM - +263 71 838 9027: Good afternoon madam Julia, I've managed to get one headmaster from Mutimwi Highschool and I've had a chat with them
7/3/24, 12:42 PM - Tushti Edoofa: Okay Vimbai!
Were you able to explain about the edoofa scholarship program.
7/3/24, 12:43 PM - Tushti Edoofa: The program director will contact with the headmaster if head is ready for a call.
7/3/24, 12:44 PM - Tushti Edoofa: *When the school’s per-term fees are less than $100, we do not get a school call done by Edoofa's Program Director.
The reason behind this is that it is very much doubt that the students from this school will or will not be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education*
7/3/24, 12:45 PM - Tushti Edoofa: I hope you read our african school reform project details.
7/3/24, 12:45 PM - +263 71 838 9027: Yed

7/3/24, 12:45 PM - Tushti Edoofa: Once you go through all the information, and see that this can be a million opportunities for your school, then please help me fill out the form so that the Program Director of Edoofa can contact you.

8/3/24, 11:17 AM - +263 71 838 9027: The fourth student has filled in the application form

8/3/24, 11:20 AM - Tushti Edoofa: Okay. I will send the form to counseling team.
8/3/24, 11:20 AM - +263 71 838 9027: But the third project is becoming a challenge all the head masters I'm connecting seem not to be interested I'm trying to convince them but at the end they aren't replying
8/3/24, 11:20 AM - +263 71 838 9027: Ok
8/3/24, 11:33 AM - Tushti Edoofa: I completely understand your situation, Vimbai! My suggestion is to concentrate primarily on the community building project, given the challenges you are encountering in connecting with headmasters. However, simultaneously, you can work on the African school reform project too, as working on both projects will increase your chances of earning more credits. All the best Vimbai!!
8/3/24, 11:34 AM - +263 71 838 9027: Ok ma'am thank you
