25/12/23, 5:07 PM - Saloni Edoofa added you
28/12/23, 8:05 AM - Saloni Edoofa: Hello Tadiwanashe,
I hope this message finds you well.

As we approach the end of the year, I am filled with excitement about the upcoming new year. It's a time for optimism, hope, and the opportunity to nurture beautifully curated relationships. However, upon reflection on our journey so far, I recognize a bit of inconsistency and irregularity.

I understand that the holiday season, including Christmas celebrations and New Year enjoyment, may be keeping you occupied. Despite this, I believe it's important for us to consider how we can strengthen our relationship in the EWYL Program. I am eager to hear your thoughts on how we can restart and enhance our collaboration.
28/12/23, 10:55 AM - +263 71 239 0648: Is it possible to move our sessions to Saturday only where we can use more time
29/12/23, 8:43 AM - Saloni Edoofa: Good morning Tadiwanashe,
How are you?
29/12/23, 8:45 AM - Saloni Edoofa: For me to accommodate that schedule, I would have to know the reason behind shifting it to Saturday, you availability and purpose?
29/12/23, 1:57 PM - +263 71 239 0648: Good afternoon Ms Saloni, How are you?
29/12/23, 1:59 PM - +263 71 239 0648: Oh yes the reason I want to shift the schedule is because I found a part time job where I am currently working during the day for 5 days a week. At times I even go to work on Saturdays so if possible we can shift them to Sundays where I promise to be there all day.
2/1/24, 3:59 PM - Saloni Edoofa: _Good day to each wonderful member of our group_!

As we embark on this new year, I want to extend my heartfelt wishes for a joyous *NEW YEAR 2024*🌟 filled with good health, peace, success, thrilling adventures, and a remarkable academic journey that awaits you🫶🏻.

I am genuinely excited to _hear about your New Year celebrations and any resolutions you've set for yourself_. Whether they involve personal growth, academic achievements, or new experiences, I am eager to support and celebrate your journey throughout the year🎯.

27/1/24, 8:38 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Good day!
I hope you're doing well.

I know from the past few days, that I could not respond but allow me to share a story very close to my heart🫰🏻

I became a part of Edoofa almost two years back with initial thoughts on how my relationship would be, will I be a good mentor, or will I be able to think like my students, and so on. With these thoughts, I began my journey. Honestly speaking, I learned a lot each day, and yes, made some mistakes but I did not know that now there is going something that I will cherish for my lifetime, our bond. In this journey so far, I have guided more than 500 students, and beyond guidance I have made sure that I can create a transformation in their lives🌟
27/1/24, 8:38 PM - Saloni Edoofa: As an individual, I always believe that the learning process is life never ends and the more you learn, the better the guidance becomes, with a heavy heart, *I've chosen to immerse myself in higher education, and as a result, I'll be taking a step back from being your mentor🥺*
*You have a special place in my heart, and I am profoundly thankful for the honor of being your mentor*. Our journey doesn't end here; it merely takes a different course. I have full confidence in your continued success.

*I want to assure you that the Mentorship team will reach out to you soon to discuss the upcoming plan and ensure a seamless transition.*
All the best🫶🏻

While we were having multiple conversations with our students in the past few days for the meet & greet event, we figured that there is a slight confusion in the invitation dates. Hence, I wanted to quickly reach out and ensure that the same is not the case with you.

- As per the invitation, *you* are supposed to attend the event along with your parents on *19th of February* which is Monday.
 
- If you are recommending any of *your friends (Non Edoofians)* along with their parents to attend the event, as per their choice, the seminar is scheduled for *18th of February (8am/1pm) or 19th February(1pm)*. They should carry a physical copy of their admit cards to enter the event.
