27/1/24, 8:41 AM - Sharda Edoofa: *Greetings of the day, Farai*
I hope this message finds you in good spirits. I want to share some heartfelt news with you. After careful consideration, I've come to a decision that carries a mix of emotions. *I've chosen to immerse myself in higher education, and as a result, I'll be taking a step back from being your mentor.*

As we journey through this moment, I can't help but feel a mix of emotions realizing that our daily interactions are about to change. *Saying goodbye to our current way of connecting brings a bittersweet feeling*, but deep down, I see change as a chance for growth and the discovery of new opportunities.

Reflecting on our shared journey, I am truly humbled by the extraordinary moments we've experienced together—the bonds we've forged, the shared laughter, and the countless instances of mutual growth and learning.
27/1/24, 8:41 AM - Sharda Edoofa: *You have a special place in my heart, and I am profoundly thankful for the honor of being your mentor*. Our journey doesn't end here; it merely takes a different course. I have full confidence in your continued success.

Thank you for being an integral part of my life's journey. Keep radiating brilliance, dare to dream ambitiously, and always remember the remarkable potential within you. 
*I want to assure you that the mentorship team will reach out to you soon to discuss the upcoming plan and ensure a seamless transition.*

I am sure you have already been told about the EWYL Program by your career counsellor. You might also know of our star Proud Edoofians who have been able to self sponsor their higher education through the EWYL Program alone, completely lifting the financial burden off of the shoulders of their family. I congratulate you on being selected into the Edoofa Scholarship Program. I want you to know that the path ahead is by no stretch of imagination easy, however, if you are determined to work hard and make most of the opportunities that I present to you, financial independence and limitless growth are yours for the taking.

5/3/24, 3:05 PM - +263 71 517 8453: Thank you
5/3/24, 3:08 PM - Sharda Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your EWYL team. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our two key objectives are met. Let me tell you what our main objectives are:

The *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfil all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.

The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.

Did you understand the goals, Farai?
5/3/24, 3:16 PM - +263 71 517 8453: Yes
6/3/24, 2:16 PM - Sharda Edoofa: Good Afternoon Farai,

8/3/24, 10:09 AM - +263 71 517 8453: Okay
