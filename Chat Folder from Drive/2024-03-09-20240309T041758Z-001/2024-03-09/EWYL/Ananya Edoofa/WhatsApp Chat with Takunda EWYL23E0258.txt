22/1/24, 4:37 PM - Ananya Edoofa: *_🌟 URGENT UPDATE 🌟_*

Takunda, guess what? I'm super excited to share some awesome news – next month, we're planning a trip to Africa! 🌍 Yep, you heard it right! Our team is coming to your town. Just like last year, our students will be helping us organize the event, and we're looking for volunteers to join in and help manage everything! 🙌

Trust me, it's going to be an amazing experience with lots to learn! 🌈 Since planning this big event takes proper time and effort, our team will be occupied so tight. Therefore, I was thinking of connecting only once a week for the time being.

Therefore, your new session timing will be *Every Tuesday, 12:00 p.m*. ⏰

Can't wait for this adventure together, see you tomorrow! 🚀
1/2/24, 4:05 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Takunda!

*_Are you tired of connecting with us only through screens?_*
 
Well, now is the time! Guess what? I'm super excited to share some awesome news – just like last year, this month, we're planning an annual and exclusive meet & greet in Africa! 🌍🎉 

However, this time it’s different! It’s a mega event that has never happened in the history of Zimbabwe, as we are expecting a crowd of 5000 people! Surprising, isn't it?

Now, we understand that you and your parents must have a lot of questions in your mind as you are in the middle of your University admission process. Therefore, keeping this in mind, along with Mr. Angad, our admissions team, and our counselors will be there as well to address all of your concerns!
1/2/24, 4:05 PM - Ananya Edoofa: So, bring your parents along, and don't miss your chance to expedite your admission process. Not only that, get ready to dive into the opportunities you are going to experience when you are here in India, as Mr. Angad himself is going to walk you through the journey of being an Edoofian. After all, only 6 months are left! So, get ready for this epic adventure, and I'll share the details with you super soon! ⚡

*By the way, we'd like to reserve your seats in advance. Could you please let us know how many people you'll be coming with? This will help us allocate the right number of slots for you.*
7/2/24, 11:18 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Takunda!

I have been expecting to hear from you for the past couple of days, but I can see you have not been able to get back to me for certain reasons I am unaware of. You see, I have been looking forward to having you at the event as I know how beneficial it will be for you. Most of my students have already quite enthusiastically reserved seats for themselves and their family and friends.

Is everything alright? Are you facing any challenges? Is there something you'd like to share?
