29/12/23, 12:14 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Cathrine!

The current session has commenced, and it appears you're not on your EWYL line. Is it challenging to be present on time? I've noticed a recurring need for reminders. Could we discuss the reason behind this?
29/12/23, 12:22 PM - +48 574 536 864: Good afternoon, she travelled to the countryside and network connectivity is terrible and that's the reason why she has not been active.
29/12/23, 12:25 PM - +48 574 536 864: Sincere apologies for that she will make ammends once she returns from the countryside.
29/12/23, 3:22 PM - Ananya Edoofa: *_New Year is here!🌟_*

As we are going to embark on a new chapter at the dawn of the New Year, I wanted to take a moment to send my warmest wishes your way. May this coming year be filled with joy, laughter, and moments of profound happiness. 🌈

Along with you, the Edoofa Family will also be occupied in *New Year Celebrations from tomorrow till 1 January 2024* and we will *resume from 2 January onwards*🎉

Wishing you a year ahead filled with love, prosperity, and the fulfillment of your heart's desires. May every day be a chance for you to shine and make a positive impact. ✨

Happy New Year in advance! 🎊
