22/2/24, 8:31 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Let us begin our session with an interesting fact: _Africa is home to the world's largest land mammal - the African elephant. These majestic creatures can weigh up to 6 metric tons (approximately 13,000 pounds) and are known for their intelligence, complex social structures, and remarkable memory. Isn't that incredible?_
22/2/24, 8:40 AM - +263 77 339 4607: Great

How are you doing? How was your weekend?🚀
26/2/24, 9:43 AM - Ananya Edoofa: You know, I have an amazing session planned for you along with some targets for this month. However, I am quite disappointed that you did not attend your session. Can I know the reason behind this?
26/2/24, 10:48 AM - +263 77 339 4607: She must be attending a lecture now
26/2/24, 4:50 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, @263773394607 

I hope you're doing well. I understand that Chiedza is currently in class. However, it's crucial that we complete our orientation on time. So, I suggest that you join and attend the orientation in her place. When Chiedza becomes available, she can catch up and take it forward from there.

Kindly excuse me for not being able to connect today for our session. Our whole team was involved in an important meeting with Mr. Angad, where we discussed crucial strategies to enhance your skills and readiness for employment. I hope that together, we will work hard and fulfill our dreams.

Now that we cannot have our session as planned, let us connect tomorrow at 8:30 am. Have a good day ahead!

27/2/24, 3:06 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Chiedza!

During my discussion with Mr. Angad today, I realized the need for more efficient and effective sessions with my students to expedite our progress.

In light of this, I have decided to *reschedule our sessions to Monday through Friday from 1:30 PM to 3:00 PM*. This schedule change will ensure more productive sessions, and I look forward to seeing you tomorrow at the new time! <This message was edited>
27/2/24, 5:24 PM - +263 71 208 4615: okay thank you
28/2/24, 1:33 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Chiedza!

Let us begin our session with another fact! 

_Did you know that there is a species of jellyfish that is biologically immortal? Yes, you heard that right! The Turritopsis dohrnii jellyfish can revert back to its juvenile form after reaching maturity, essentially resetting its life cycle. Imagine being able to hit the 'reset' button on life like that! If only we humans had the same ability on Mondays, right?_😅🪼
28/2/24, 2:08 PM - +263 71 208 4615: yes yes😃
28/2/24, 2:09 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Chiedza, why are you late?
28/2/24, 2:10 PM - +263 71 208 4615: my network was not acting up
28/2/24, 2:10 PM - +263 71 208 4615: but now lets begin
28/2/24, 2:11 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your EWYL team. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our two key objectives are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
28/2/24, 2:12 PM - +263 71 208 4615: no i don't know them will you tell me
28/2/24, 2:15 PM - Ananya Edoofa: So, the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
28/2/24, 2:15 PM - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees. <This message was edited>
28/2/24, 2:17 PM - +263 71 208 4615: ok ok i understand
28/2/24, 2:21 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the EWYL team. 
Ms. Sanjana is the Head of the Department and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have Ms. Davi, Head coach is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
28/2/24, 2:23 PM - +263 71 208 4615: noted thank you
28/2/24, 2:34 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, now that our session time is over, let's conclude it here. We will reconnect tomorrow at 1:30 PM. Have a good day!🌱
28/2/24, 3:05 PM - +263 71 208 4615: thank you and same applies
29/2/24, 1:32 PM - +263 71 208 4615: good afternoon mentor
29/2/24, 1:32 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Chiedza!

I hope you are doing well. Are you ready to move ahead with our discussion?🚀
29/2/24, 1:32 PM - +263 71 208 4615: yess im ready
29/2/24, 1:37 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I would like you to be informed of our program structure that will happen after we discuss all our projects in depth (not now), which will mandate us to connect a minimum of 2 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
29/2/24, 1:43 PM - +263 71 208 4615: yesss yess thats interesting
29/2/24, 1:45 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
29/2/24, 1:46 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
4/3/24, 1:35 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Chiedza!

Let us begin our session with a mind-blowing fact: The human brain is more active during sleep than it is while watching TV! While you're catching those Z's, your brain is busy processing memories, consolidating information, and even problem-solving. It's like a bustling city that never sleeps inside your head! So next time you're snoozing, remember, that your brain is hard at work.🧠😴
4/3/24, 2:37 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I was hoping to hear from you today, but since we couldn't connect, I'm looking forward to connecting with you positively tomorrow. Let's aim for a productive discussion then. Have a great day!
5/3/24, 1:34 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Chiedza!

Let us begin our session with a giggle: 'Why did the scarecrow win an award?'

Because he was outstanding in his field!😅
5/3/24, 1:39 PM - +263 71 208 4615: hello mentor
5/3/24, 1:49 PM - Ananya Edoofa: So may I know which section from the newsletter you *liked the most*, personally for me, it is very difficult to tell, each section has its taste and interest.
5/3/24, 1:53 PM - +263 71 208 4615: same applies so where exactly can i start
5/3/24, 1:57 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Well, I could not understand what you are trying to say, can you please explain?
5/3/24, 2:02 PM - +263 71 208 4615: okay okay i like the section where Tadiwa gweshe  inspired other edoofians
5/3/24, 2:11 PM - Ananya Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound, Chiedza?
5/3/24, 2:16 PM - +263 71 208 4615: that sound brilliant 🤗
5/3/24, 2:18 PM - Ananya Edoofa: We’re ready to begin your EWYL program now, and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects you can and will be a part of. Once you’ve gone through it thoroughly- we can discuss your understanding and then help you get started with the projects! Is that clear?
5/3/24, 2:18 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
5/3/24, 2:38 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I was expecting a response from you, but since our session time is over, let's connect tomorrow at 1:30 PM.

I hope tomorrow's session will be more fruitful, as I am quite disappointed with today's session. See you!
5/3/24, 7:08 PM - +263 71 208 4615: noted
