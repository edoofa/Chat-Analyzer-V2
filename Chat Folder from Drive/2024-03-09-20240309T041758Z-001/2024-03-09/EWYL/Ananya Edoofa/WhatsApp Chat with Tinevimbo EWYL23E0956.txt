Also, don't forget to review what we covered last.🌟
21/2/24, 10:13 AM - Tinashe Zengeya -  Estate Manager ZW: Noted
21/2/24, 10:15 AM - Tinashe Zengeya -  Estate Manager ZW: What really impressed me id how the Edoophians are being taken care of. You guys really take good care of the students. From the videos that we saw you just see Students being happy out there.

Also the issue of doing Seminars where they meet enterprenuers and influential people i really liked it and it helps students to plan and have sense of purpose in their lives
21/2/24, 10:28 AM - Ananya Edoofa: It's wonderful to hear that the Meet and Greet '24 conference provided you with valuable insights and reassurance about the authenticity and significance of the Edoofa scholarship. Your enthusiasm and determination to meet all the scholarship requirements are truly commendable, and I have no doubt that you'll achieve your goal of becoming part of India's population by the end of this year.
21/2/24, 10:32 AM - Tinashe Zengeya -  Estate Manager ZW: Thank you
22/2/24, 1:36 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Tinevimbo!

I hope you are doing well, how are you? Are you ready for your session?🚀
22/2/24, 1:45 PM - Tinashe Zengeya -  Estate Manager ZW: Afternoon
22/2/24, 1:45 PM - Tinashe Zengeya -  Estate Manager ZW: How are you
22/2/24, 1:50 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Thank you for asking, I am doing great!
22/2/24, 1:50 PM - Ananya Edoofa: MENTOR - Moving ahead, I'd like to tell you about the *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
22/2/24, 1:51 PM - Tinashe Zengeya -  Estate Manager ZW: Please enlighten me so that we move foward
22/2/24, 1:56 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring that *Tinevimbo* is prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach his/her professional goals.
22/2/24, 1:56 PM - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of the student’s tuition fees.
22/2/24, 1:58 PM - Tinashe Zengeya -  Estate Manager ZW: Thats clear.
22/2/24, 1:58 PM - Tinashe Zengeya -  Estate Manager ZW: Maybe a question here, How competitive are these degrees on the job market especially a case whereby the student wants to come and work here in Zimbabwe?
22/2/24, 1:59 PM - Tinashe Zengeya -  Estate Manager ZW: Do you have students that came back to Zimbabwe and they managed to get jobs easily?
22/2/24, 2:59 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
22/2/24, 2:59 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Now that our session time is over, I want to give you an update that our team is taking off tomorrow and won't have any sessions over the weekend. Let's reconvene and continue our discussions on Monday. Have a nice weekend!
22/2/24, 3:00 PM - Tinashe Zengeya -  Estate Manager ZW: ok
22/2/24, 3:00 PM - Tinashe Zengeya -  Estate Manager ZW: thank you and travel safely

27/2/24, 1:38 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Tinevimbo

Before we dive into today's session, here's a fun fact about parrots: Did you know that parrots are one of the few animal species that can mimic human speech? Some parrots, like the African grey parrot, have been known to learn hundreds of words and even use them in context! Isn't that amazing?🦜
27/2/24, 1:49 PM - Tinashe Zengeya -  Estate Manager ZW: Amaizing, thanks for this wisdom 😀
27/2/24, 1:49 PM - Tinashe Zengeya -  Estate Manager ZW: Afternoon

Ms. Sanjana is the Head of the Department and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have Ms. Davi, Head coach is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
27/2/24, 1:53 PM - Tinashe Zengeya -  Estate Manager ZW: Noted
27/2/24, 1:53 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure that will happen after we discuss all our projects in depth (not now), which will mandate us to connect a minimum of 2 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
27/2/24, 2:16 PM - Tinashe Zengeya -  Estate Manager ZW: So i will be doing this session on behalf of my brother?

28/2/24, 1:28 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Tinevimbo!

Let us begin our session with another fact! 

_Did you know that there is a species of jellyfish that is biologically immortal? Yes, you heard that right! The Turritopsis dohrnii jellyfish can revert back to its juvenile form after reaching maturity, essentially resetting its life cycle. Imagine being able to hit the 'reset' button on life like that! If only we humans had the same ability on Mondays, right?_😅🪼
28/2/24, 1:35 PM - Tinashe Zengeya -  Estate Manager ZW: 😂😂😂😂 interesting
28/2/24, 1:43 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
28/2/24, 2:34 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, now that our session time is over, let's conclude it here. We will reconnect tomorrow at 1:30 PM. Have a good day!🌱
29/2/24, 1:34 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Tinevimbo!

I hope you are doing well. Are you ready to move ahead with our discussion?🚀
29/2/24, 2:20 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Tinevimbo,I was hoping to hear from you. Can you please let me know why you were unable to attend your session?
29/2/24, 2:20 PM - Tinashe Zengeya -  Estate Manager ZW: Afternoon
29/2/24, 2:20 PM - Tinashe Zengeya -  Estate Manager ZW: Had a terrible headache today
29/2/24, 2:21 PM - Tinashe Zengeya -  Estate Manager ZW: Was actually sleeping, and now im back online
29/2/24, 2:22 PM - Ananya Edoofa: That's alright! How are you feeling now?

29/2/24, 2:40 PM - Tinashe Zengeya -  Estate Manager ZW: Received, thanks
4/3/24, 1:34 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Tinevimbo

Let us begin our session with a mind-blowing fact: The human brain is more active during sleep than it is while watching TV! While you're catching those Z's, your brain is busy processing memories, consolidating information, and even problem-solving. It's like a bustling city that never sleeps inside your head! So next time you're snoozing, remember, that your brain is hard at work.🧠😴
4/3/24, 1:51 PM - Tinashe Zengeya -  Estate Manager ZW: 😂😂😂😂
4/3/24, 1:52 PM - Tinashe Zengeya -  Estate Manager ZW: Crazy indeed
4/3/24, 1:52 PM - Tinashe Zengeya -  Estate Manager ZW: Good afternoon
4/3/24, 1:55 PM - Ananya Edoofa: So, did you get a chance to read the document?
4/3/24, 2:37 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I was hoping to hear from you today, but since we couldn't connect, I'm looking forward to connecting with you positively tomorrow. Let's aim for a productive discussion then. Have a great day!
5/3/24, 1:34 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Tinevimbo!

Let us begin our session with a giggle: 'Why did the scarecrow win an award?'

Because he was outstanding in his field!😅
5/3/24, 1:56 PM - Tinashe Zengeya -  Estate Manager ZW: 😀😀
5/3/24, 1:56 PM - Tinashe Zengeya -  Estate Manager ZW: Good afternoon
5/3/24, 2:00 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Today, I have another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once *Tinevimbo* forms a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 05 minutes should be enough.
5/3/24, 2:00 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
5/3/24, 2:38 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I was expecting a response from you, but since our session time is over, let's connect tomorrow at 1:30 PM.

I hope tomorrow's session will be more fruitful, as I am quite disappointed with today's session. See you!

7/3/24, 1:32 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Tinevimbo!

Let us begin our session with a new discovery!

*New Deep-Sea Species Discovered in Mariana Trench*

_Scientists have identified a new species of deep-sea creature, named Mariana octopus profundus, in the depths of the Mariana Trench. This discovery showcases the remarkable biodiversity of Earth's oceans._
7/3/24, 1:37 PM - Tinashe Zengeya -  Estate Manager ZW: Interesting
7/3/24, 1:39 PM - Ananya Edoofa: So, did you get a chance to read the document?
7/3/24, 1:43 PM - Tinashe Zengeya -  Estate Manager ZW: I did not manage, i have scheduled it for today after work.
7/3/24, 2:00 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, you can read it later. Now Since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how *Tinevimbo* can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-
1. Give best in the projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss EWYL sessions without informing the mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share challenges and the things *Tinevimbo* is good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make mentor trust the student fully
 Wait for a response - and then start again!
