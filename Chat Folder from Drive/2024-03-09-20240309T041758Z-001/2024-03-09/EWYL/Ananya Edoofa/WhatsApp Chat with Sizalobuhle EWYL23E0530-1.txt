7/1/24, 8:46 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good evening!

I wanted to share some exciting news with all of you. As you may have noticed, my schedule has been quite packed lately due to work commitments. The reason behind this is something truly special – our team has organized a three-day long industrial visit called SLICE CON' 24 for our Indian Edoofians! 🚀

During this event, we are fortunate to have the Co-founders and CEOs of prominent brands who will be present and sharing their invaluable experiences in one-on-one sessions. Yes, you read that right – they will be there live, right in front of us! What's even more thrilling is that a few of our students are presenting a presentation directly to these CEOs, showcasing why Africa, your homeland, is the best market for their products. 🤝
7/1/24, 8:46 PM - Ananya Edoofa: While I am filled with excitement for this event, please note that due to my involvement in the visit on the 8th, 9th, and 10th of January, our regular sessions won't be taking place on these days. When we connect on the 11th of January, I'll share my students' experiences and pictures with you. 📸✨
7/1/24, 9:04 PM - +263 77 562 0930: Great news we appreciate that Ms Ananya
18/1/24, 9:39 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Sizalobuhle!

I hope you are doing well. I've noticed that you consistently arrive late for your sessions. Is it challenging for you to be punctual for our sessions?
18/1/24, 9:41 AM - +263 77 562 0930: I am doing well mam , mostly its because l am at work so the chances of using a phone are low
22/1/24, 9:27 AM - +263 77 562 0930: Good morning mam  , today we are having pressure at work so I won't manage to join the session .
22/1/24, 9:28 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Sizalobuhle!

That's alright. I understand.
22/1/24, 4:22 PM - Ananya Edoofa: *_🌟 URGENT UPDATE 🌟_*

Sizalobuhle, guess what? I'm super excited to share some awesome news – next month, we're planning a trip to Africa! 🌍 Yep, you heard it right! Our team is coming to your town. Just like last year, our students will be helping us organize the event, and we're looking for volunteers to join in and help manage everything! 🙌

Trust me, it's going to be an amazing experience with lots to learn! 🌈 Since planning this big event takes proper time and effort, our team will be occupied so tight. Therefore, I was thinking of connecting only once a week for the time being.

Therefore, your new session timing will be *Every Tuesday, 9:30 a.m*. ⏰

Can't wait for this adventure together, see you tomorrow! 🚀
23/1/24, 9:31 AM - +263 77 562 0930: Good morning Ms Ananya ,thus great news to hear from you , can't wait for your visit.
23/1/24, 10:32 AM - Ananya Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
23/1/24, 10:32 AM - Ananya Edoofa: *Using WhatsApp Community Groups for Outreach:*
*Step 1*: Create a WhatsApp group and name it using the format STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DDMMYYYY. For example, if you're the mentor, it would be *MENTOR NAME/DDMMYYYY*.

*Step 2*: Find the right students for your group to ensure effective communication about Edoofa.

*Purpose*: The goal is to reach a broad audience, providing accurate information about Edoofa to prepare them for a smooth counseling session.
23/1/24, 10:32 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Execution:

*Identify Potential Candidates:* - Reach out to students in Form 6 or those who have recently passed Form 6 (A-Level Examination).

*Connect with Form 6 Divisions*: - Assume there are 3 divisions in Form 6, each with around 20 students. Begin with one division. Connect with these students and request to be added to their official or unofficial WhatsApp group.

*Share Your Group Link*: - Once added, share the link to your created WhatsApp group, explaining that it's an opportunity to pursue education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on tuition fees. Encourage them to join for more details.

*Repeat the Process*: - Move on to the next divisions of Form 6, applying the same approach. In this way, you'll reach at least 60 students (3 divisions of Form 6).

*Extend to Form 5*: - Repeat the process in Form 5, targeting another 60 students.
23/1/24, 10:32 AM - Ananya Edoofa: *Result*:

You would have effectively shared information about Edoofa with a minimum of 120 students, creating awareness and interest among potential applicants. This method ensures a wide reach and prepares students for the upcoming counseling sessions.

23/1/24, 10:32 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, in order to move ahead with your second project, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
23/1/24, 10:32 AM - Ananya Edoofa: I am ____________, a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in *Zimbabwe*, where tuition fees range from ZWL 650,000 to ZWL 750,000 per term. When considering the yearly cost, including food and accommodation, it exceeds $2,100 in our beloved Zimbabwe⏫

Today, the internet is a necessity, and I truly realized its importance when preparing for my journey to India. We are all well aware of the expenses we have to bear just to access subpar internet services. During my school days, I used to spend a minimum of $35-$40 a month to ensure I had sufficient internet, which added up to around $450-$500 annually.
*It's remarkable to discover that in India, students value their educational infrastructure so much that they can access a necessity like the internet for around $40 for the entire year.*💥
Conversely, when speaking to my seniors in Zimbabwe, I realized that I might have to compromise on my choice of course due to limited available seats. Furthermore, many seniors are struggling with unemployment after graduating in Zimbabwe
I had a strong desire to support my family through part-time employment during my course, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn between $50 and $100 per month throughout the course.
*While pursuing tertiary education in India is more affordable than universities in Zimbabwe, it comes with its own challenges. I diligently followed the 5S, which played a crucial role in helping me qualify for this scholarship. I urge you to go through these Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors will ask you questions based on the information in the flyer I have attached*
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5s of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!
