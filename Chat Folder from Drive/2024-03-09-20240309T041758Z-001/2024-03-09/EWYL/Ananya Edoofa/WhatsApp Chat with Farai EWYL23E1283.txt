Let us begin our session with another fact! 

_Did you know that there is a species of jellyfish that is biologically immortal? Yes, you heard that right! The Turritopsis dohrnii jellyfish can revert back to its juvenile form after reaching maturity, essentially resetting its life cycle. Imagine being able to hit the 'reset' button on life like that! If only we humans had the same ability on Mondays, right?_😅🪼
28/2/24, 1:34 PM - +263 71 227 4883: Yes, right😅
28/2/24, 1:34 PM - +263 71 227 4883: Good afternoon, Ms Ananya
28/2/24, 1:42 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Now, before we proceed further, I'd love to get to know you better! Would you be willing to share a bit about yourself? Your hobbies, goals, and passions?
28/2/24, 1:48 PM - +263 71 227 4883: Okay, Ms Ananya my hobbies are soccer, reading and of course athletics. My goal is to become a successful programer so that l can help my community and l am passionate about coding and programming developing new programs and learning new codes
28/2/24, 1:51 PM - Ananya Edoofa: It's wonderful to hear about your diverse interests and ambitious goals. Soccer, reading, and athletics sound like great hobbies to stay active and engaged. And aiming to become a successful programmer to help your community is truly inspiring. Your passion for coding and programming, as well as your eagerness to develop new programs and learn new codes, will undoubtedly take you far in achieving your aspirations. Keep pursuing your passions and working towards your goals with dedication and enthusiasm!
28/2/24, 1:53 PM - +263 71 227 4883: Okay, thank you Ms Ananya
28/2/24, 1:55 PM - +971 52 850 5495 joined using this group's invite link
28/2/24, 1:57 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Well, I can see that some other people have joined the group besides you. May I learn a little about each of them? I would appreciate it if we could engage in a quick conversation and get to know each other a bit.
28/2/24, 2:00 PM - +263 71 227 4883: @971528505495 is my father and @263714850333 is my mother
28/2/24, 2:01 PM - +971 52 850 5495: Greetings to you, I’m Farai’s father
28/2/24, 2:04 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, @971528505495 

I hope you are doing great! I am so happy to connect with you.
28/2/24, 2:05 PM - +971 52 850 5495: Welcome. Hope I did not miss a lot
28/2/24, 2:06 PM - Ananya Edoofa: No, you did not!
28/2/24, 2:06 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Farai,Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your EWYL team. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our two key objectives are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
28/2/24, 2:07 PM - +263 71 227 4883: No, l do not understand Ms Ananya
28/2/24, 2:07 PM - Ananya Edoofa: That's alright. Let me help you.
28/2/24, 2:07 PM - Ananya Edoofa: So,  the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
28/2/24, 2:08 PM - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
28/2/24, 2:10 PM - +263 71 227 4883: Okay, Ms Ananya now l have a better understanding
28/2/24, 2:12 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the EWYL team. 
Ms. Sanjana is the Head of the Department and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have Ms. Davi, Head coach is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
28/2/24, 2:15 PM - +263 71 227 4883: Okay, nice knowing you Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi
28/2/24, 2:18 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure that will happen after we discuss all our projects in depth (not now), which will mandate us to connect a minimum of 2 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
28/2/24, 2:21 PM - +263 71 227 4883: Yes, it is interesting
28/2/24, 2:24 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
28/2/24, 2:24 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
28/2/24, 2:34 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Now that our session time is over, let's conclude it here. We will reconnect tomorrow at 1:30 PM. Have a good day!🌱

4/3/24, 1:32 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Farai!

Alright! Let us begin our session with a mind-blowing fact: The human brain is more active during sleep than it is while watching TV! While you're catching those Z's, your brain is busy processing memories, consolidating information, and even problem-solving. It's like a bustling city that never sleeps inside your head! So next time you're snoozing, remember, that your brain is hard at work.🧠😴
4/3/24, 1:36 PM - +263 71 227 4883: Yes, that's correct Ms Ananya
4/3/24, 1:37 PM - +263 71 227 4883: Good afternoon Ms Ananya
4/3/24, 1:45 PM - Ananya Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
4/3/24, 1:51 PM - +263 71 227 4883: Okay, thank you Ms Ananya
4/3/24, 1:54 PM - Ananya Edoofa: We’re ready to begin your EWYL program now, and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects you can and will be a part of. Once you’ve gone through it thoroughly- we can discuss your understanding and then help you get started with the projects! Is that clear?
4/3/24, 1:54 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
4/3/24, 1:59 PM - +263 71 227 4883: Yes, Ms Ananya it is clear
4/3/24, 1:59 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I want you to share your understanding of the document with me. I just want to ensure we don’t miss anything! So, please, go on sharing your understanding of the above document.
4/3/24, 2:04 PM - +263 71 227 4883: okay,
4/3/24, 2:31 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I am waiting for your response, Farai
4/3/24, 2:45 PM - +263 71 227 4883: I understood that from project 1 students will Identify local organizations in their regions and they will have to identify the decision makers who wrk in these companies and they will be reaching out to these individuals to share edoofa's vision, mission and what they do. After that they will have to arrange a call meeting between edoofa and these organisations  and lastly they will be facilitating the signing of contract
4/3/24, 2:46 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Great work, Farai!🌟
4/3/24, 2:46 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Well, since our session time is over, let us connect in our next session which is tomorrow. Have a good day!🤝🏼

5/3/24, 1:33 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Farai!

Let us begin our session with a giggle: 'Why did the scarecrow win an award?'

Because he was outstanding in his field!😅
5/3/24, 1:34 PM - +263 71 227 4883: Good afternoon, Ms Ananya😅
5/3/24, 1:44 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I will start by explaining the projects in detail. I am sharing an audio file with you. Here’s my suggestion- listen to it at least twice, you know- to make sure we don’t miss anything out, and then get back to me when you are finished with the process!
5/3/24, 1:44 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
5/3/24, 1:49 PM - +263 71 227 4883: Yes, l am done now

5/3/24, 1:56 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good job, Farai!🌟

5/3/24, 2:07 PM - Ananya Edoofa: So, I am going to share an extremely significant document with you. Read it thoroughly as well as with careful details. I assure you- it’s as important as it sounds. After reading it, I want you to share what you understood from it. It helps me get a sense of how you’re learning with me!
5/3/24, 2:07 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
5/3/24, 2:36 PM - +263 71 227 4883: I understood that when looking for the right company you have to know the nature of the company as the company must be student-centric or it should be recreational. And also the scale of the company is a key factor when looking for a suitable company as the company must vary from 50-200 employees. And the company must be financially stable also.  And lastly the company must have a founder with a strong background in terms of experience and qualifications, as they are the most suitable ones
5/3/24, 2:40 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Since our session time is over, let's connect tomorrow at 1:30 PM.🤝🏼

*New Deep-Sea Species Discovered in Mariana Trench*

7/3/24, 1:38 PM - Ananya Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
7/3/24, 1:42 PM - +263 71 227 4883: Okay, Ms Ananya
7/3/24, 1:55 PM - Ananya Edoofa: *Using WhatsApp Community Groups for Outreach:*
*Step 1*: Create a WhatsApp group and name it using the format STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DDMMYYYY. For example, if you're the mentor, it would be *MENTOR NAME/DDMMYYYY*.

*Step 2*: Find the right students for your group to ensure effective communication about Edoofa.

*Purpose*: The goal is to reach a broad audience, providing accurate information about Edoofa to prepare them for a smooth counseling session.
7/3/24, 1:55 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Execution:

*Identify Potential Candidates:* - Reach out to students in Form 6 or those who have recently passed Form 6 (A-Level Examination).

*Connect with Form 6 Divisions*: - Assume there are 3 divisions in Form 6, each with around 20 students. Begin with one division. Connect with these students and request to be added to their official or unofficial WhatsApp group.

*Share Your Group Link*: - Once added, share the link to your created WhatsApp group, explaining that it's an opportunity to pursue education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on tuition fees. Encourage them to join for more details.

*Repeat the Process*: - Move on to the next divisions of Form 6, applying the same approach. In this way, you'll reach at least 60 students (3 divisions of Form 6).

*Extend to Form 5*: - Repeat the process in Form 5, targeting another 60 students.
7/3/24, 1:55 PM - Ananya Edoofa: *Result*:

You would have effectively shared information about Edoofa with a minimum of 120 students, creating awareness and interest among potential applicants. This method ensures a wide reach and prepares students for the upcoming counseling sessions.

7/3/24, 2:11 PM - +263 71 227 4883: Okay, Ms Ananya l have understood the process
7/3/24, 2:13 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, in order to move ahead with your second project, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
7/3/24, 2:13 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I am ____________, a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in *Zimbabwe*, where tuition fees range from ZWL 650,000 to ZWL 750,000 per term. When considering the yearly cost, including food and accommodation, it exceeds $2,100 in our beloved Zimbabwe⏫

Today, the internet is a necessity, and I truly realized its importance when preparing for my journey to India. We are all well aware of the expenses we have to bear just to access subpar internet services. During my school days, I used to spend a minimum of $35-$40 a month to ensure I had sufficient internet, which added up to around $450-$500 annually.
*It's remarkable to discover that in India, students value their educational infrastructure so much that they can access a necessity like the internet for around $40 for the entire year.*💥
Conversely, when speaking to my seniors in Zimbabwe, I realized that I might have to compromise on my choice of course due to limited available seats. Furthermore, many seniors are struggling with unemployment after graduating in Zimbabwe
I had a strong desire to support my family through part-time employment during my course, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn between $50 and $100 per month throughout the course.
*While pursuing tertiary education in India is more affordable than universities in Zimbabwe, it comes with its own challenges. I diligently followed the 5S, which played a crucial role in helping me qualify for this scholarship. I urge you to go through these Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors will ask you questions based on the information in the flyer I have attached*
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5s of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

This is an experience that I acknowledge as being a Proud Edoofian!🎉
