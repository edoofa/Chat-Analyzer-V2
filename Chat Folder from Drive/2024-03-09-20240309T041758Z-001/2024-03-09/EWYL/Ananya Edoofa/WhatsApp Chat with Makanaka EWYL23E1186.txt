2/2/24, 2:30 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
2/2/24, 2:31 PM - +263 71 899 7085: No
2/2/24, 2:35 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Alright!  Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals. <This message was edited>
2/2/24, 2:35 PM - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
2/2/24, 2:37 PM - +263 71 899 7085: Well understood
3/2/24, 1:34 PM - +263 71 899 7085: Good day

5/2/24, 1:32 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Makanaka!

Let us begin our session with an amazing fact! 

_*Did you know that a day on Venus is actually longer than a year on Venus? Even though it only takes Venus about 225 Earth days to go around the sun, it spins really slowly, taking about 243 Earth days to turn once on its axis. So, a day on Venus is longer than a whole year there! 🫨*_
5/2/24, 1:33 PM - +263 71 899 7085: Really,
5/2/24, 1:33 PM - +263 71 899 7085: Good afternoon
5/2/24, 1:41 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Yes! Now,  let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms. Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
5/2/24, 1:43 PM - +263 71 899 7085: Noted
5/2/24, 1:49 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure that will happen after we discuss all our projects in depth (not now), which will mandate us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
5/2/24, 1:58 PM - +263 71 899 7085: Yes
5/2/24, 2:03 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.

Let us begin our session with a fact about elephants: Did you know that elephants are one of the few animals that can recognize themselves in a mirror? This ability indicates a level of self-awareness that is rare in the animal kingdom and suggests that elephants have a complex understanding of themselves and their surroundings. 🐘

8/2/24, 2:07 PM - +263 71 899 7085: Noted
8/2/24, 2:09 PM - Ananya Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
8/2/24, 2:11 PM - +263 71 899 7085: Yes
8/2/24, 2:11 PM - Ananya Edoofa: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*

*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED*
8/2/24, 2:11 PM - Ananya Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
8/2/24, 2:11 PM - Ananya Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)
8/2/24, 2:11 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Once they add you there, you can share the link to YOUR WhatsApp Group (that you created in the first step) and tell them that on that group you will be sharing information about an exciting opportunity where they get a chance to pursue your education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on the tuition fee. To know more, please get added to the group.
8/2/24, 2:11 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
8/2/24, 2:11 PM - Ananya Edoofa: 2] ADD MENTOR:

Make sure that before you start interacting with the participants in the group that you created for the community-building project, YOU ADD ME.

The purpose of doing this is that:
- I will be able to track your progress and guide you through learning the networking skill
- I will be able to see the concerns raised by students and we can discuss them accordingly.
- I will be able to see whether the right information has been shared with all the students

8/2/24, 2:22 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Let me introduce you to the scholarship program that is providing me an opportunity to fulfill all my dreams related to higher education - EDOOFA -Education For All.
8/2/24, 2:22 PM - Ananya Edoofa: To give you an insight about Edoofa, it is a scholarship program initiated by *Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd., INDIA*. Edoofa believes quality education should be accessible to all and not just the privilege of a few. Through our scholarship program that is based on a work-study model, Edoofa solves both problems, that of *lack of affordability and of employability in higher education.* Edoofa stays with the students throughout their academic life as mentor and caretaker, right from building the application, applying to colleges, training, and making them job-ready. This is an experience that I acknowledge as being a Proud Edoofian!🎉
8/2/24, 2:22 PM - Ananya Edoofa: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, Edoofa has worked with 250+ Universities in India and has a community of *more than 3000 students* from different countries📍
8/2/24, 2:22 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Edoofa receives applications from _South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries_. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 2100 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just *affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven* so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains
8/2/24, 2:22 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I would like each one of you to take a look at the video that I am sharing below. The video is regarding Edoofa’s Meet and Greet session where Edoofa’s founders Mr. Angad Singh and Mr. Avreen Singh interacted with various School Principals, African students, and their parents in Harare, Zimbabwe last year.
Please have a look at it and share your thoughts with me.

26/2/24, 1:55 PM - Ananya Edoofa: It serves as a link between every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations.
26/2/24, 1:56 PM - Ananya Edoofa: We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that most of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, "I am a proud Edoofian.
