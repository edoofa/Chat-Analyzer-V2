I understand that there is a short delay in starting our journey; however, amidst the preparations, I also fell sick. Therefore, it took me two days to recover.

17/2/24, 12:44 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Amanda!

I hope this message finds you well. I apologize for not being able to connect with you yesterday. Unfortunately, I experienced a technical glitch that prevented me from accessing my WhatsApp account. I've managed to restore it this morning.
19/2/24, 9:03 AM - +260 766524514: Hey

20/2/24, 1:07 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Amanda!

I hope you are doing well. I want to inform you that our team is currently occupied with the Africa meet and greet, and as a result, I am a bit busy lately. Since our team has successfully hosted an event in Zimbabwe, we are now preparing for events in other countries as well. Due to this, our sessions are being postponed, but don't worry, we will resume our sessions in the coming two days.

22/2/24, 1:04 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Amanda!

I'm happy to share that our team just got back from an incredible event in Zimbabwe, and let me tell you, this time our Meet & Greet event was bigger and better! It was an amazing three-day event! 🎉

This time, it wasn't just Mr. Angad who went, but our whole admissions team, counseling team, and the program director joined in too!

Students and parents alike had the exclusive opportunity to dive deep into the exciting journey that awaits them in India. And guess what? Mr. Angad himself talked about exciting employment opportunities for everyone in India along with the EWYL plan. We also organized a special scholarship test for students who aren't part of the Edoofian community yet. 

Also, we're planning to bring the excitement to Zambia too! So, get ready to embark on a journey filled with endless possibilities and boundless opportunities.

7/3/24, 1:48 PM - +260 766524514: Amanda Mwelwa 
First born and I am seventeen years old
I love baking and reading novels. My goal and passion are to make it in life, becoming a very big, successful woman, and owning my own company.
7/3/24, 1:58 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Wow, you know what, I also like baking but I am not that good at it.😅

7/3/24, 2:03 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Well, I can see that some other people have joined the group besides you. May I learn a little about each of them? I would appreciate it if we could engage in a quick conversation and get to know each other a bit.

7/3/24, 2:12 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your EWYL team. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our two key objectives are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
7/3/24, 2:16 PM - +260 766524514: Yes I do
7/3/24, 2:18 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Wow, would you like to brief me about those?

7/3/24, 2:33 PM - +260 766524514: Our goal at the end is to ensure that I earn credits, which will need a lot of determination and hard work for us to go through this journey
7/3/24, 2:36 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Absolutely, Amanda!
7/3/24, 2:36 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Well, I wish we could have connected for more time. However, since our session time is over, let us connect tomorrow at the same time.🌸

7/3/24, 2:37 PM - +260 766524514: Have a blessed day
8/3/24, 1:39 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Amanda!

Before we commence today's session, let's take a moment to recognize and celebrate International Women's Day. Have you extended your best wishes to the incredible women in your life?👩🏾‍🤝‍👩🏽
8/3/24, 1:47 PM - +260 766524514: Good afternoon 😊
8/3/24, 1:47 PM - +260 766524514: I have wished her

8/3/24, 1:49 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Thank you and same to you, Amanda!🤝🏼
8/3/24, 1:50 PM - +260 766524514: Anytime 😊
8/3/24, 1:51 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Now, Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
8/3/24, 1:51 PM - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
8/3/24, 1:58 PM - +260 766524514: Alright noted
8/3/24, 1:58 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the EWYL team. 
Ms. Sanjana is the Head of the Department and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have Ms. Davi, Head coach is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
8/3/24, 2:01 PM - +260 766524514: Alright noted
8/3/24, 2:02 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure that will happen after we discuss all our projects in depth (not now), which will mandate us to connect a minimum of 2 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
8/3/24, 2:05 PM - +260 766524514: Very interesting
8/3/24, 2:06 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
8/3/24, 2:06 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
8/3/24, 2:21 PM - +260 766524514: Am done reading
8/3/24, 2:27 PM - Ananya Edoofa: So may I know which section from the newsletter you *liked the most*, personally for me, it is very difficult to tell, each section has its taste and interest.
8/3/24, 2:28 PM - +260 766524514: The three quotes ♥️
8/3/24, 2:29 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Did you notice the _Edoofa Hall of Inspiration_? I am sure you would one day want yourself to be celebrated in this section, the entire Student community reads this newsletter and it's a great deal to be mentioned by the founder himself, isn't it?
8/3/24, 2:33 PM - +260 766524514: I did notice. It's also great. being mentioned can be a great honour
8/3/24, 2:34 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Now that our session time is over, let us connect on Monday at 1:30 PM, as we do not have our sessions over the weekend! Happy weekend!🚀
8/3/24, 2:34 PM - +260 766524514: Happy weekend to you
