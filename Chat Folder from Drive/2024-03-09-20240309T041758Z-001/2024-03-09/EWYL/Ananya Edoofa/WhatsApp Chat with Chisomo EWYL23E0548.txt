I really hope that your Christmas went well. Let's discuss how we celebrated our Christmas this year in our session! Come on, join your EWYL Line, and let's talk about our celebration!
22/1/24, 4:38 PM - Ananya Edoofa: *_🌟 URGENT UPDATE 🌟_*

Chisomo, guess what? I'm super excited to share some awesome news – next month, we're planning a trip to Africa! 🌍 Yep, you heard it right! Our team is coming to your town. Just like last year, our students will be helping us organize the event, and we're looking for volunteers to join in and help manage everything! 🙌

Trust me, it's going to be an amazing experience with lots to learn! 🌈 Since planning this big event takes proper time and effort, our team will be occupied so tight. Therefore, I was thinking of connecting only once a week for the time being.

Therefore, your new session timing will be *Every Tuesday, 12:00 p.m*. ⏰

Can't wait for this adventure together, see you tomorrow! 🚀

I hope this message finds you and your family in good health and spirits. I have been reading that there have been *reports of a potential cholera outbreak in the Malawi region recently*, so I wanted to reach out to make sure that you and your loved ones are safe and doing well.🩵

As our regular sessions are currently on hold, I wanted to take this opportunity to connect with you personally and express my concern.

11/2/24, 7:20 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good evening, Chisomo!

With an upcoming visit to Africa on the horizon, I know that we won't be able to connect for our regular sessions for a short while. However, as your mentor, I am committed to ensuring your continuous development and progress.

In light of this, I've discovered an incredible resource that I believe will greatly benefit you. It's about utilizing AI to learn *multiple languages* uniquely and interactively. Personally, I've found it to be incredibly effective as learning multiple languages not only enhances your *employability but also prepares you for global opportunities.*🌏

So, go and explore the world of different languages with your fingertips!. Here's the link to get started: *https://wordtap.net/how-to-use-chatgpt-to-learn-a-language/*🌟

I'm happy to share that our team just got back from an incredible event in Zimbabwe, and let me tell you, this time our Meet & Greet event was bigger and better! It was an amazing three-day event! 🎉

This time, it wasn't just Mr. Angad who went, but our whole admissions team, counseling team, and the program director joined in too!

Students and parents alike had the exclusive opportunity to dive deep into the exciting journey that awaits them in India. And guess what? Mr. Angad himself talked about exciting employment opportunities for everyone in India along with the EWYL plan. We also organized a special scholarship test for students who aren't part of the Edoofian community yet. 

I've got some photos to share with you. Get ready for a sneak peek into the excitement and energy of the event!

Also, we're planning to bring the excitement to Zambia too! So, get ready to embark on a journey filled with endless possibilities and boundless opportunities.🚀
