23/12/23, 2:25 PM - +263 78 524 3459: Thank you so ma'am. Have an enjoyable Christmas too. Thank you 🙏.
26/12/23, 4:48 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Shepherd!

I hope you all had the merriest Christmas celebration! 🎄 Due to the festive break, our session on Monday had to be called off. No worries, though – I hope you enjoyed the extra time for the festivities.

To make up for it, let's have a compensatory session *tomorrow at 9:30 am*.
I'm looking forward to catching up with all of you!
27/12/23, 5:01 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Shepherd!

Well, what I have observed today is that if I have not shared a reminder with you before the session, you have clearly missed your session! Don't you think it's a bit irresponsible behavior? Do you get a reminder before your classes at school?
27/12/23, 5:04 PM - +263 78 524 3459: Good evening Mrs Ananya. Today I waited for the session earlier but the rain started and disturbed the system ma'am I hope and promise that I won't miss the same tomorrow.
29/12/23, 3:24 PM - Ananya Edoofa: *_New Year is here!🌟_*

As we are going to embark on a new chapter at the dawn of the New Year, I wanted to take a moment to send my warmest wishes your way. May this coming year be filled with joy, laughter, and moments of profound happiness. 🌈

Along with you, the Edoofa Family will also be occupied in *New Year Celebrations from tomorrow till 1 January 2024* and we will *resume from 2 January onwards*🎉

Wishing you a year ahead filled with love, prosperity, and the fulfillment of your heart's desires. May every day be a chance for you to shine and make a positive impact. ✨

Happy New Year in advance! 🎊

I hope you had a fantastic New Year! Because of the holiday break, our Monday session had to be canceled, but don't worry about it. I hope you enjoyed the extra time for celebrations.🌟

To make up for it, let's have a special session *tomorrow at 9:30 AM*. Get ready to tell me how you celebrated the New Year, and I'll also share my resolution with you. I'm looking forward to catching up with you!🕤
2/1/24, 4:05 PM - +263 78 524 3459: Ok mam i understand thank you so much. I will catch up with you during that time
7/1/24, 8:51 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good evening!

I wanted to share some exciting news with all of you. As you may have noticed, my schedule has been quite packed lately due to work commitments. The reason behind this is something truly special – our team has organized a three-day long industrial visit called SLICE CON' 24 for our Indian Edoofians! 🚀

During this event, we are fortunate to have the Co-founders and CEOs of prominent brands who will be present and sharing their invaluable experiences in one-on-one sessions. Yes, you read that right – they will be there live, right in front of us! What's even more thrilling is that a few of our students are presenting a presentation directly to these CEOs, showcasing why Africa, your homeland, is the best market for their products. 🤝
7/1/24, 8:51 PM - Ananya Edoofa: While I am filled with excitement for this event, please note that due to my involvement in the visit on the 8th, 9th, and 10th of January, our regular sessions won't be taking place on these days. When we connect on the 11th of January, I'll share my students' experiences and pictures with you. 📸✨
7/1/24, 9:13 PM - +263 78 524 3459: Ok ma'am thank so much for informing. I wish you a very nice time.
11/1/24, 10:13 AM - Ananya Edoofa: A lovely morning to you, Shepherd!

Kindly excuse me for the short delay. I wanted to share a few glimpses of the industrial visit, SLICE CON 24, that was going on for the last three days, especially for our Indian Edoofinas! You know, it was so happening, and I am happy to share that we also welcomed Mr. Peter Hobwani, Deputy Head of Mission and Head of Chancery, Embassy of the Republic of Zimbabwe to India.

Not only this, but we also welcomed various industrial leaders, and it went super well; our students managed to give a presentation in front of them, and they really liked it. Our students also enjoyed the 'Tech made easy' sessions, where we taught them to use new-age technological tools, including Artificial Intelligence. The sweetest part was that a few of our students even prepared a surprise performance for us as well. It was indeed an amazing experience. When you are here in India, we will also connect at such events.
11/1/24, 11:56 AM - +263 78 524 3459: Good morning Mrs Ananya. I am glad to hear about this. It's really amazing to hear that you had a very good time. Thank you for sharing the good news.
24/1/24, 10:54 AM - Ananya Edoofa: *_🌟 URGENT UPDATE 🌟_*

Shepherd, guess what? I'm super excited to share some awesome news – next month, we're planning a trip to Africa! 🌍 Yep, you heard it right! Our team is coming to your town. Just like last year, our students will be helping us organize the event, and we're looking for volunteers to join in and help manage everything! 🙌

Trust me, it will be an amazing experience with lots to learn! 🌈 Since planning this big event takes time and effort, our team will be so tight. 

Because of this, I'm proposing a slight adjustment to our session timetable. *As of now, we won't be having our session as initially planned. However, worry not! I will soon share an updated timetable*. Meanwhile, you can keep working on your targets and keep me posted on your EWYL group.
24/1/24, 11:27 AM - +263 78 524 3459: Waal that's very wonderful ma'am I'm so glad to hear this special news. Thank you for sharing such news.
25/1/24, 12:45 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Shepherd!

I have some exciting news to share with you. Tomorrow, we are going to celebrate Republic Day! Now, let me tell you a bit about it.

Republic Day is a special day in India. It's a time when we remember and celebrate the day our country adopted its Constitution. Just like a constitution helps guide a country, ours outlines the rules and principles that make India the diverse and vibrant place it is.

On Republic Day, we have a big parade in the capital city, where people from all over the country come together to showcase our culture, traditions, and achievements. It's like a colorful and lively show with music, dance, and different displays. The Indian flag is hoisted, and everyone sings the national anthem with pride.

People also fly kites, dress up in traditional clothes, and enjoy delicious food! 🇮🇳✨

I won't spill all the details here, but I've recorded a special audio message filled with enthusiasm, encouragement and a whole lot of excitement. Your name is shining bright, and I can't wait for you to listen in on the great news.

So, go, play, and get ready for a burst of positivity coming your way! 🚀
27/1/24, 12:59 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
27/1/24, 3:04 PM - Ananya Edoofa: A few of my students have classes scheduled for 1:30 PM, and I believe moving our call to 2:30 PM would accommodate everyone's schedule more effectively. So, let us connect at 2:30 PM.
30/1/24, 10:22 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Shepherd!

As the month is ending, I've been evaluating the performance of my students, and I noticed that you have made decent progress this month by sharing 9 offline application forms with me.

I understand that we haven't been connecting through our sessions lately; however, as your mentor, my priority is your progress, and I don't want you to compromise on that. Therefore, I have taken out some time specifically for you so that we can have a conversation about your progress.

So, tell me, what is your progress? What are your plans to achieve the target of the month? Are you facing any challenges? <This message was edited>
31/1/24, 7:13 AM - +263 78 524 3459: Good morning Mrs Ananya. I'm sorry for not connecting it was just because I was certain unconscious maybe it was because of the heat wave but I'm glad that I'm Available again I wasn't online for the past few days but now I'm back

7/2/24, 4:04 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Also, I know we haven't been able to connect for our sessions lately, but I just wanted to touch base with you. Last week, we talked about your performance, and I want you to know that I'm really happy with how you've been doing. It's important to keep up the good work and stay focused on our goals.

Since it's a new month, I'm thinking about setting a target for you. This week, I'd like you to reach out to 10 students and help them with their application forms. Even though we might not be meeting regularly right now, you need to keep striving for your targets and maintaining your performance. Consistency is key to your future success.

It was so good and the head of admission was so lovely to me . The team treated me very well and we had a nice time at the hotel. It was very fortunate to me as the meeting brought some solutions to my on coming situation that is the scholarship admission. We found the solutions to the challenges that I had been facing. More thanks to the team!
