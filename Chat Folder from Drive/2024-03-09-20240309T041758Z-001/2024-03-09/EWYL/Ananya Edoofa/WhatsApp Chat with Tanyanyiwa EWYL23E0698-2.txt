7/1/24, 8:50 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good evening!

I wanted to share some exciting news with all of you. As you may have noticed, my schedule has been quite packed lately due to work commitments. The reason behind this is something truly special – our team has organized a three-day long industrial visit called SLICE CON' 24 for our Indian Edoofians! 🚀

During this event, we are fortunate to have the Co-founders and CEOs of prominent brands who will be present and sharing their invaluable experiences in one-on-one sessions. Yes, you read that right – they will be there live, right in front of us! What's even more thrilling is that a few of our students are presenting a presentation directly to these CEOs, showcasing why Africa, your homeland, is the best market for their products. 🤝
7/1/24, 8:50 PM - Ananya Edoofa: While I am filled with excitement for this event, please note that due to my involvement in the visit on the 8th, 9th, and 10th of January, our regular sessions won't be taking place on these days. When we connect on the 11th of January, I'll share my students' experiences and pictures with you. 📸✨
7/1/24, 9:13 PM - +263 77 344 2930: This is marvelous.We are very proud to know that Africa is the best market for your products.To be honest I am impressed,in fact I am flattered.Thank you so much for appreciating Africa 👏👏👏
7/1/24, 9:13 PM - +263 77 344 2930: It's fine we will connect on the 11th of January.We are eagerly waiting for your feedback and experiences with the students.I hope you will enjoy your experiences
11/1/24, 10:11 AM - Ananya Edoofa: A lovely morning to you, Tanyanyiwa!

Kindly excuse me for the short delay. I wanted to share a few glimpses of the industrial visit, SLICE CON 24, that was going on for the last three days, especially for our Indian Edoofinas! You know, it was so happening, and I am happy to share that we also welcomed Mr. Peter Hobwani, Deputy Head of Mission and Head of Chancery, Embassy of the Republic of Zimbabwe to India.

Not only this, but we also welcomed various industrial leaders, and it went super well; our students managed to give a presentation in front of them, and they really liked it. Our students also enjoyed the 'Tech made easy' sessions, where we taught them to use new-age technological tools, including Artificial Intelligence. The sweetest part was that a few of our students even prepared a surprise performance for us as well. It was indeed an amazing experience. When you are here in India, we will also connect at such events.
11/1/24, 10:15 AM - +263 77 634 0475: Morng.Thanks for the update.Happy to hear that the event went well
11/1/24, 10:25 AM - +263 77 344 2930: Good morning.This is wonderful indeed.You really had an amazing time

11/1/24, 11:46 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Indeed! Now, I know it took me some extra time to find the pictures for you, and our session could not take place. We shall now resume our session on Monday. Meanwhile, I want you to follow your EWYL ritual daily so that you can receive the weekend activity.

Not only this, but since this week is completely off for you, I want to know your progress with your projects. You know, seeing over 400 students in this event has motivated me to work for my students even harder. I want you to be here in India and pay your fee all by yourself. For this, I promise to assist you in every manner and make you feel like a proud Edoofian! To achieve this, you should take some baby steps and have a lot of faith in yourself to proceed for a big goal. You have limited time, start utilizing your weekend and set yourself a target. For example, you can set a goal of connecting with 5 students and be determined that you will reach this number and share the application forms with me by Monday. After that, you should always connect with me for a review so that you can evaluate and redefine your target. By the way, have you taken feedback from me earlier?
11/1/24, 12:03 PM - +263 77 344 2930: Thank you for your kind words.I was really impressed by your words,"I want you to be here in India and pay your fees all by yourself."As a parent this is also my wish because here in Zimbabwe we are facing economic hardships of unprecedented levels.The economy is still declining and this year it is becoming worse because of the drought.As a parent I am grateful for all your assistance, motivation and mentoring.You are really in a class of your own.Thank you so much you have really transformed the lives of many Zimbabwean students who were very hopeless

Tanyanyiwa, guess what? I'm super excited to share some awesome news – next month, we're planning a trip to Africa! 🌍 Yep, you heard it right! Our team is coming to your town. Just like last year, our students will be helping us organize the event, and we're looking for volunteers to join in and help manage everything! 🙌

Trust me, it will be an amazing experience with lots to learn! 🌈 Since planning this big event takes time and effort, our team will be so tight. 

In light of this, I'm proposing a slight adjustment to our session timetable. *As of now, we won't be having our session as initially planned. However, worry not! I will soon share an updated timetable* and I am confident that together, we will create something truly extraordinary.

25/1/24, 12:49 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Tanyanyiwa!

I have some exciting news to share with you. Tomorrow, we are going to celebrate Republic Day! Now, let me tell you a bit about it.

Republic Day is a special day in India. It's a time when we remember and celebrate the day our country adopted its Constitution. Just like a constitution helps guide a country, ours outlines the rules and principles that make India the diverse and vibrant place it is.

On Republic Day, we have a big parade in the capital city, where people from all over the country come together to showcase our culture, traditions, and achievements. It's like a colorful and lively show with music, dance, and different displays. The Indian flag is hoisted, and everyone sings the national anthem with pride.

People also fly kites, dress up in traditional clothes, and enjoy delicious food! 🇮🇳✨

Kindly excuse me for a delayed response. Actually due to some technical glitch, I had no access to WhatsApp.
18/2/24, 1:13 PM - +263 77 344 2930: It's fine
18/2/24, 1:16 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I agree with you. It's great that you know a lot about your daughter's education. Since you're interested in finding good education options, I think it's a good idea for both you and your daughter to go to the event. There, you can learn about the good things about studying in India. It'll help you see all the benefits and opportunities available. Going together will let you talk about everything and decide what's best for your daughter's future.
18/2/24, 1:30 PM - +263 77 344 2930: I agree with you.Personally I thought its very wise for her to go to LPU but she is insisting that she wants to go to University.She did not register for tomorrow,s event.I have consulted so many people and all of them told me frankly that your daughter has lost a golden opportunity to study in India.
18/2/24, 1:31 PM - +263 77 344 2930: University of Zimbabwe
18/2/24, 1:33 PM - +263 77 344 2930: It is mind boggling that given the two choices LPU and UZ she chose UZ.Its surprising
