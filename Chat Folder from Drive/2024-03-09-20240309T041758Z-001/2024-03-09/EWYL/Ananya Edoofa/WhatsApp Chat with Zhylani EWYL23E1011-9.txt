5/1/24, 1:53 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
5/1/24, 1:54 PM - Saloni Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
5/1/24, 1:56 PM - +260 96 7889730: It’s a good objective
5/1/24, 1:56 PM - +260 779684925: Thank you for the information

27/1/24, 8:45 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Good day!
I hope you're doing well.

I know from the past few days, that I could not respond but allow me to share a story very close to my heart🫰🏻

I became a part of Edoofa almost two years back with initial thoughts on how my relationship would be, will I be a good mentor, or will I be able to think like my students, and so on. With these thoughts, I began my journey. Honestly speaking, I learned a lot each day, and yes, made some mistakes but I did not know that now there is going something that I will cherish for my lifetime, our bond. In this journey so far, I have guided more than 500 students, and beyond guidance I have made sure that I can create a transformation in their lives🌟
27/1/24, 8:45 PM - Saloni Edoofa: As an individual, I always believe that the learning process is life never ends and the more you learn, the better the guidance becomes, with a heavy heart, *I've chosen to immerse myself in higher education, and as a result, I'll be taking a step back from being your mentor🥺*
*You have a special place in my heart, and I am profoundly thankful for the honor of being your mentor*. Our journey doesn't end here; it merely takes a different course. I have full confidence in your continued success.

*I want to assure you that the Mentorship team will reach out to you soon to discuss the upcoming plan and ensure a seamless transition.*
All the best🫶🏻

7/2/24, 10:59 AM - Saloni Edoofa: Good morning, @260967889730 !

I'm Ms. Tushti from the Academic Board of Edoofa, and I see that you're quite worried about your child's EWYL journey.

I understand your concern as a parent and appreciate your involvement in your daughter's higher education. I'm sure you're aware of Ms. Saloni's decision to pursue her higher education, and we as a team respect and appreciate her choice. However, I want to assure you that our mentorship team will soon get in touch with you to provide a new mentor for Zhylani.

Currently, our entire team is occupied with the Africa Visit. Planning such a huge event from a distance is indeed hectic and tedious. So, we're currently packed with preparations, but don't worry, we will resume your sessions after the Africa trip. In the meantime, if you face any challenges, you can always connect with me here in your EWYL group, and I'll be assisting you personally.
7/2/24, 10:59 AM - Saloni Edoofa: Also, I noticed that you asked something about seat reservations. Can you please help me understand your concern a bit better?

I would like to inform you that while Ms Saloni has stepped down from her role as your mentor, the Team is actively searching for a suitable mentor to guide you through your journey. I urge you to be patient. Meanwhile, do not hesitate to share your progress with the projects with me. Also let me know of any challenges you might be facing that you need help with.

I'm happy to share that our team just got back from an incredible event in Zimbabwe, and let me tell you, this time our Meet & Greet event was bigger and better! It was an amazing three-day event! 🎉

This time, it wasn't just Mr. Angad who went, but our whole admissions team, counseling team, and the program director joined in too!

Students and parents alike had the exclusive opportunity to dive deep into the exciting journey that awaits them in India. And guess what? Mr. Angad himself talked about exciting employment opportunities for everyone in India along with the EWYL plan. We also organized a special scholarship test for students who aren't part of the Edoofian community yet.

2/3/24, 10:47 AM - Saloni Edoofa: Hello Zhylani and Parents

It is unfortunate to know that you are feeling this way. This is not the experience that we would want you to carry. However, I would like to re-iterate that the entire team was engaged in the preparation and execution of the meet & greet event that took place in Zimbabwe last weekend and the same was shared with you as well. 
I also would like to share with you that Zhylani's EWYL program will resume from Monday and her new mentor would be Ms. Ananya. She has the experience of mentoring, coaching and nurturing early professional careers of more than 300 students. She is known for her genuine passion, care and problem solving ability for her students. 

I have put in a special word with Ms. Ananya. She would also be able to connect on a quick call with you on Monday that would help us solve any misunderstandings and in the same lines, Ms Ananya would be able to share her plans for Zhylani in the EWYL program moving forward.
2/3/24, 10:50 AM - +260 779684925: That's good to know
2/3/24, 10:50 AM - +260 96 7889730: What’s her academic background and qualifications how will she be with Zhylani and wouldn’t we have the same experience with the previous mentor that was rude.
2/3/24, 2:45 PM - +260 96 4841330: 🙏🙏
4/3/24, 9:43 AM - Saloni Edoofa added Ananya Edoofa
4/3/24, 10:11 AM - Saloni Edoofa: Good morning Parents,
I understand your concern as a parent and I really appreciate how attentive you are towards Zhylani's higher education. 

However, I want you to rest assured as Ms. Ananya is one of our most experienced mentor. She has been mentoring over 500 students! So, I am sure she will definitely do justice to this role for Zhylani and about her academic background and qualifications, she would be able to better explain. As I have added her in this group let us hear from her directly all about her!
4/3/24, 10:14 AM - +260 96 7889730: Very well noted experience has been tough on us trusting your mentors again
4/3/24, 11:22 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Parents and Zhylani!

I am thrilled to introduce myself as Ms. Ananya, your new mentor for the EWYL program.🌟

I want to assure you that I'm here to continue the positive journey you've had with Ms. Saloni. She spoke highly of you and your enthusiasm for the EWYL program. I'm eager to build on the foundation she has laid and support you in reaching your goals.🚀
4/3/24, 11:22 AM - Ananya Edoofa: With unwavering dedication and a heart filled with optimism, I am committed to fostering a nurturing environment where your dreams can flourish. Together, let's unleash your potential and conquer every challenge that comes our way.🤝🏼
4/3/24, 11:25 AM - +260 96 7889730: Good morning mentor Ananya how long is your mentorship program and our granted to you will stay longer with us.
Trusting you will be better  than saloni
4/3/24, 2:53 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Well, I understand your concern and desire for your child's success. Ms. Saloni's approach as a mentor might have been strict and dominating, but it's important to recognize that different methods work for different individuals. While her approach may have positively impacted many, it's also understandable that it may not suit everyone.

Rest assured, I am committed to giving my best to support Zylani. I will provide guidance and encouragement in a way that fosters his growth and development. However, I hope you know that success in mentoring relies not only on the mentor but also on the willingness and dedication of the student.

I can assure you that if Zylani shows dedication and sincerity by attending sessions regularly and putting in the effort, I will match that commitment wholeheartedly. So, can you assure me that she will be committed?
4/3/24, 3:00 PM - +260 779684925: I will be committed
4/3/24, 3:01 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Well, I am happy to know that, Zhylani!🌟
4/3/24, 3:01 PM - Ananya Edoofa: So, to kick things off with a bang, I wanted to share a fantastic video with you that I think will help us connect on a deeper level. Get ready to be inspired!

5/3/24, 1:42 PM - Ananya Edoofa: So, today I will start by explaining the projects in detail. I am sharing an audio file with you. Here’s my suggestion- listen to it at least twice, you know- to make sure we don’t miss anything out, and then get back to me when you are finished with the process!
5/3/24, 1:43 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
5/3/24, 1:51 PM - +260 96 4841330: Sure

5/3/24, 2:23 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Yes, Zhylani! These projects are not subject-specific. You must be aware that they are at the core of basic 21st-century job skills required in every field nowadays.

Subject-specific knowledge is what you will study in college for 3-4 years. However, these skills are something no one is going to teach you, yet they are definitely required to step into the corporate world.
5/3/24, 2:24 PM - +260 779684925: I see
5/3/24, 2:27 PM - Ananya Edoofa: You will learn about some basic skills that are essential in any industry, such as business development, networking, sales, social media, and leadership.

Having this amount provides a sense of security, knowing that you have your one semester fees covered. So, as your mentor, I strongly encourage you to work hard. The time and energy you invest now will be cherished for a lifetime.
5/3/24, 2:57 PM - +260 779684925: Well understood

8/3/24, 2:03 PM - Ananya Edoofa: *Using WhatsApp Community Groups for Outreach:*
*Step 1*: Create a WhatsApp group and name it using the format STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DDMMYYYY. For example, if you're the mentor, it would be *MENTOR NAME/DDMMYYYY*.

*Step 2*: Find the right students for your group to ensure effective communication about Edoofa.

*Purpose*: The goal is to reach a broad audience, providing accurate information about Edoofa to prepare them for a smooth counseling session.
8/3/24, 2:03 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Execution:

*Identify Potential Candidates:* - Reach out to students in Form 6 or those who have recently passed Form 6 (A-Level Examination).

*Connect with Form 6 Divisions*: - Assume there are 3 divisions in Form 6, each with around 20 students. Begin with one division. Connect with these students and request to be added to their official or unofficial WhatsApp group.

*Share Your Group Link*: - Once added, share the link to your created WhatsApp group, explaining that it's an opportunity to pursue education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on tuition fees. Encourage them to join for more details.

*Repeat the Process*: - Move on to the next divisions of Form 6, applying the same approach. In this way, you'll reach at least 60 students (3 divisions of Form 6).

*Extend to Form 5*: - Repeat the process in Form 5, targeting another 60 students.
8/3/24, 2:03 PM - Ananya Edoofa: *Result*:

You would have effectively shared information about Edoofa with a minimum of 120 students, creating awareness and interest among potential applicants. This method ensures a wide reach and prepares students for the upcoming counseling sessions.

8/3/24, 2:06 PM - +260 779684925: I have read through it carefully
8/3/24, 2:06 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, in order to move ahead with your second project, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
8/3/24, 2:06 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I am ____________, a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in *Zimbabwe*, where tuition fees range from ZWL 650,000 to ZWL 750,000 per term. When considering the yearly cost, including food and accommodation, it exceeds $2,100 in our beloved Zimbabwe⏫

Today, the internet is a necessity, and I truly realized its importance when preparing for my journey to India. We are all well aware of the expenses we have to bear just to access subpar internet services. During my school days, I used to spend a minimum of $35-$40 a month to ensure I had sufficient internet, which added up to around $450-$500 annually.
*It's remarkable to discover that in India, students value their educational infrastructure so much that they can access a necessity like the internet for around $40 for the entire year.*💥
Conversely, when speaking to my seniors in Zimbabwe, I realized that I might have to compromise on my choice of course due to limited available seats. Furthermore, many seniors are struggling with unemployment after graduating in Zimbabwe
I had a strong desire to support my family through part-time employment during my course, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn between $50 and $100 per month throughout the course.
*While pursuing tertiary education in India is more affordable than universities in Zimbabwe, it comes with its own challenges. I diligently followed the 5S, which played a crucial role in helping me qualify for this scholarship. I urge you to go through these Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors will ask you questions based on the information in the flyer I have attached*
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5s of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

8/3/24, 2:06 PM - Ananya Edoofa: To give you an insight about Edoofa, it is a scholarship program initiated by *Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd., INDIA*. Edoofa believes quality education should be accessible to all and not just the privilege of a few. Through our scholarship program that is based on a work-study model, Edoofa solves both problems, that of *lack of affordability and of employability in higher education.* Edoofa stays with the students throughout their academic life as mentor and caretaker, right from building the application, applying to colleges, training, and making them job-ready. This is an experience that I acknowledge as being a Proud Edoofian!🎉
8/3/24, 2:06 PM - Ananya Edoofa: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, Edoofa has worked with 250+ Universities in India and has a community of *more than 3000 students* from different countries📍
8/3/24, 2:06 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Edoofa receives applications from _South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries_. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 2100 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just *affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven* so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains
8/3/24, 2:06 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I would like each one of you to take a look at the video that I am sharing below. The video is regarding Edoofa’s Meet and Greet session where Edoofa’s founders Mr. Angad Singh and Mr. Avreen Singh interacted with various School Principals, African students, and their parents in Harare, Zimbabwe last year.
Please have a look at it and share your thoughts with me.
