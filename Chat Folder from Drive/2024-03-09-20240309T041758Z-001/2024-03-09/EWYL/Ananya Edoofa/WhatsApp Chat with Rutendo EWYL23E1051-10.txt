2/1/24, 1:36 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Rutendo!

Before we dive into today's session, I'm curious – how was your New Year? Did you have a chance to celebrate and welcome the new chapter?
2/1/24, 1:46 PM - +263 77 806 7078: How are you
2/1/24, 1:46 PM - +263 77 806 7078: It was better can't complain
2/1/24, 1:46 PM - +263 77 806 7078: Yeah we may start
2/1/24, 1:51 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Now, before we move forward I would like to know more about you!
Would you like to share a quick introduction?
2/1/24, 1:52 PM - +263 77 806 7078: My name is rutendo Chifamba I'm 21 years old..I'm the first born in our family I have 5 siblings.. and I want to study businesses administration
2/1/24, 1:55 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Would you be willing to share a bit more about yourself? Your hobbies, goals, and passions?
2/1/24, 1:58 PM - +263 77 806 7078: My favorite hobie is watching football.i spend most of my time everyday watching football. . since it is the most famous sports in my country and all of my family members favors this sports especially my father and my brother.. that's how it became a hobie to me because most of the times my dad and my brother used to watch football .and that's how I found it interesting and it became the favorite hobbie. Our family is not that big .we came from a small village in guruve.  Called muchiwa village..  that's where chifamba homestead is located.
 Honestly speaking I don't know my weakness yet but my family is my strength.  And support..
 On a typical day business administrator overses the general operations of an organization department this may include supporting and overseeing teams problems solving developing and implementing plans and meeting goals that's what motivates me
 An administrator s duties include handling mail and faxes answering phones.and taking messages, scheduling appointments and staff meetings, managing database and editing documents that's I love to do in the future.. Soo this is the reason why I want to study business administration
 So In the next 5 years I see myself enhancing my leadership skills developing as a mentor and supervisor  and putting myself where can I lead  a growing team and I can see myself as an executive assistant.i believe I can grow enough experience to that position if I can get into edoofa program.
 In next five years I can see myself as an integral part of the company who has helped the contribute  to the growth and success  of an organization  I would like to continue developing my skills and knowledge in order  to be able  to take on more  responsibility  within the company
 I will be able to achieve my dreams if I get admission in Edoofa's program.and I hope I will get admitted
2/1/24, 2:01 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Your passion for football shines through in your story – it's amazing how shared interests with family can shape our hobbies! Muchiwa village in Guruve sounds like a close-knit community. It's heartening to hear that your family is your strength and support.

Choosing business administration because of your fascination with overseeing operations and your interest in tasks like scheduling and managing databases is a great match! It seems like you have a clear vision for your future – becoming an executive assistant and contributing to the growth of an organization.

Your determination to enhance leadership skills and serve as a mentor and supervisor is commendable. The Edoofa program sounds like a fantastic opportunity to further your ambitions. Best of luck on your journey, and I genuinely hope you achieve all your dreams! 🌟

2/1/24, 2:14 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
2/1/24, 2:14 PM - +263 77 806 7078: Noooo
2/1/24, 2:16 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals. <This message was edited>
2/1/24, 2:16 PM - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
2/1/24, 2:16 PM - +263 77 806 7078: I got it
2/1/24, 2:17 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms. Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
2/1/24, 2:19 PM - +263 77 806 7078: Okay thank you
2/1/24, 2:20 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure that will happen after we discuss all our projects in depth (not now), which will mandate us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
2/1/24, 2:21 PM - +263 77 806 7078: Yess
2/1/24, 2:21 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
2/1/24, 2:21 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
2/1/24, 2:27 PM - Ananya Edoofa: As our session comes to a close, I appreciate our time together today. Let's wrap it up and look forward to continuing our discussion tomorrow at the same time. I'm excited to delve into more interesting topics and explore new ideas.

And now, here's a little humor to brighten your day: Why did the computer go to therapy? Because it had too many bytes of emotional baggage! 😄
2/1/24, 2:28 PM - +263 77 806 7078: 😅😅😅😅

I was involved in a call with my students who will be presenting to prominent CEOs and entrepreneurs during a significant industrial visit scheduled for next week. Training them is crucial, especially since it's their first time participating in such an event.

As a result, I had to end our session 10 minutes earlier. We will reconnect in our next session, which is on Monday, as we do not hold sessions over the weekend. Wishing you a happy weekend!
5/1/24, 4:31 PM - +263 77 806 7078: Okay thank you
6/1/24, 1:36 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Rutendo!

I wanted to share some exciting news with all of you. As you may have noticed, my schedule has been quite packed lately due to work commitments. The reason behind this is something truly special – our team has organized a three-day long industrial visit called *SLICE CON' 24* for our Indian Edoofians! 🚀

During this event, *we are fortunate to have the Co-founders and CEOs of prominent brands* who will be present and sharing their invaluable *experiences in one-on-one sessions.* Yes, you read that right – they will be there live, right in front of us! What's even more thrilling is that a few of our students are presenting a presentation directly to these CEOs, showcasing why Africa, your homeland, is the best market for their products. 🤝
6/1/24, 1:36 PM - Ananya Edoofa: While I am filled with excitement for this event, please note that due to my involvement in the visit on the *8th, 9th, and 10th of January*, our regular sessions won't be taking place on these days. When we connect on the 11th of January, I'll share my students' experiences and pictures with you. 📸✨

11/1/24, 1:47 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Rutendo!

Before beginning our session, I want to share a few glimpses of the industrial visit, SLICE CON 24, that took place over the last three days, especially for our Indian Edoofinas! It was so happening, and I am delighted to share that we also welcomed Mr. Peter Hobwani, Deputy Head of Mission and Head of Chancery, Embassy of the Republic of Zimbabwe to India.

Not only that, but we also hosted various industrial leaders, and it went exceptionally well; our students managed to give a presentation in front of them, and they really liked it. Our students also enjoyed the 'Tech Made Easy' sessions, where we taught them to use new-age technological tools, including Artificial Intelligence. The sweetest part was that a few of our students even prepared a surprise performance for us. It was indeed an amazing experience. When you are here in India, we will also connect at such events.

18/1/24, 10:38 AM - +263 77 806 7078: Morning how are you
18/1/24, 10:38 AM - +263 77 806 7078: I'm fine now ☺️
18/1/24, 1:32 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Rutendo

Kindly excuse me for not being able to connect with you yesterday. Unfortunately, due to bad health, I had to take a day off.
18/1/24, 1:33 PM - +263 77 806 7078: Okay thanks how are you feeling now I hope you are doing well
18/1/24, 1:40 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Thank you for asking, I am good!
18/1/24, 1:40 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms. Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
18/1/24, 1:40 PM - +263 77 806 7078: Thank you
18/1/24, 1:43 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure that will happen after we discuss all our projects in depth (not now), which will mandate us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
18/1/24, 1:44 PM - +263 77 806 7078: Yessss
18/1/24, 1:51 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.

24/1/24, 2:06 PM - +263 77 806 7078: Okay thank you
24/1/24, 2:12 PM - Ananya Edoofa: And #2 – Back to the exciting part- your *Scholarship Credits*. So, here’s a quick recap of what’s the opportunity for you here-
 1. For every student that enrolls in our Edoofa Program and pays the first part of the enrolment fee, you will be awarded *$20 worth of Scholarship credits*.
2. Similarly, upon completing the Admission Formalities of the university à you will be awarded *$30 worth of Scholarship credits*.
3. There is an additional opportunity to earn $5 worth of Scholarship credits by connecting with students to provide clarity to them about the Edoofa Scholarship, which the Edoofa team will share with you!
24/1/24, 2:13 PM - +263 77 806 7078: Okay thanks
24/1/24, 2:14 PM - Ananya Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
24/1/24, 2:15 PM - +263 77 806 7078: Okay
24/1/24, 2:16 PM - Ananya Edoofa: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*

*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED*
24/1/24, 2:16 PM - Ananya Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
24/1/24, 2:16 PM - Ananya Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)
24/1/24, 2:16 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Once they add you there, you can share the link to YOUR WhatsApp Group (that you created in the first step) and tell them that on that group you will be sharing information about an exciting opportunity where they get a chance to pursue your education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on the tuition fee. To know more, please get added to the group.
24/1/24, 2:16 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
24/1/24, 2:16 PM - Ananya Edoofa: 2] ADD MENTOR:

Make sure that before you start interacting with the participants in the group that you created for the community-building project, YOU ADD ME.

The purpose of doing this is that:
- I will be able to track your progress and guide you through learning the networking skill
- I will be able to see the concerns raised by students and we can discuss them accordingly.
- I will be able to see whether the right information has been shared with all the students

24/1/24, 2:20 PM - +263 77 806 7078: Okie
24/1/24, 2:22 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, in order to move ahead with your second project, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
24/1/24, 2:22 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I am ____________, a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in *Zimbabwe*, where tuition fees range from ZWL 650,000 to ZWL 750,000 per term. When considering the yearly cost, including food and accommodation, it exceeds $2,100 in our beloved Zimbabwe⏫

Today, the internet is a necessity, and I truly realized its importance when preparing for my journey to India. We are all well aware of the expenses we have to bear just to access subpar internet services. During my school days, I used to spend a minimum of $35-$40 a month to ensure I had sufficient internet, which added up to around $450-$500 annually.
*It's remarkable to discover that in India, students value their educational infrastructure so much that they can access a necessity like the internet for around $40 for the entire year.*💥
Conversely, when speaking to my seniors in Zimbabwe, I realized that I might have to compromise on my choice of course due to limited available seats. Furthermore, many seniors are struggling with unemployment after graduating in Zimbabwe
I had a strong desire to support my family through part-time employment during my course, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn between $50 and $100 per month throughout the course.
*While pursuing tertiary education in India is more affordable than universities in Zimbabwe, it comes with its own challenges. I diligently followed the 5S, which played a crucial role in helping me qualify for this scholarship. I urge you to go through these Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors will ask you questions based on the information in the flyer I have attached*
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5s of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!
24/1/24, 2:22 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
24/1/24, 2:22 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Along with this share the following information ABOUT Edoofa with them:
24/1/24, 2:22 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Let me introduce you to the scholarship program that is providing me an opportunity to fulfill all my dreams related to higher education - EDOOFA -Education For All.
24/1/24, 2:22 PM - Ananya Edoofa: To give you an insight about Edoofa, it is a scholarship program initiated by *Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd., INDIA*. Edoofa believes quality education should be accessible to all and not just the privilege of a few. Through our scholarship program that is based on a work-study model, Edoofa solves both problems, that of *lack of affordability and of employability in higher education.* Edoofa stays with the students throughout their academic life as mentor and caretaker, right from building the application, applying to colleges, training, and making them job-ready. This is an experience that I acknowledge as being a Proud Edoofian!🎉
24/1/24, 2:22 PM - Ananya Edoofa: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, Edoofa has worked with 250+ Universities in India and has a community of *more than 3000 students* from different countries📍
24/1/24, 2:22 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Edoofa receives applications from _South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries_. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 2100 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just *affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven* so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains
24/1/24, 2:22 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I would like each one of you to take a look at the video that I am sharing below. The video is regarding Edoofa’s Meet and Greet session where Edoofa’s founders Mr. Angad Singh and Mr. Avreen Singh interacted with various School Principals, African students, and their parents in Harare, Zimbabwe last year.
Please have a look at it and share your thoughts with me.

Let us begin our session with a fun fact: 

The tongue of a blue whale, the largest animal on Earth, can weigh as much as an elephant. Despite their massive size, blue whales primarily feed on tiny shrimp-like animals called krill, using their enormous tongues to filter them from the water.🐋 <This message was edited>
