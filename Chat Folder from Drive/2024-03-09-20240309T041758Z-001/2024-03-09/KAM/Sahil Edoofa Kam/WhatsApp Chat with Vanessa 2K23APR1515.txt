30/1/24, 10:32 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: I personally had a discussion with the Admissions Head and have decided to help you in the best possible way as I understand your calibre.  May I know, what exactly happened due to which you weren't able to proceed and what are your plans as of now?
30/1/24, 6:59 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: I was anticipating your response today but unfortunately, you were not available all day. I look forward to your active participation tomorrow at 9:30 AM CAT time. I am eager for our interaction.

Over the past few days, we've been trying to connect with you to discuss your child's academic journey. We understand the financial commitments involved in providing quality education for your child. The challenges in Africa, particularly the uncertainty of employment after completing a bachelor's degree, are evident.

Considering the urgency of your child's education, I've scheduled a session for *tomorrow at 09:30 AM CAT* .Looking forward to connecting with you tomorrow.

As India seeks wisdom, let us prioritize education, creating a future where knowledge transcends boundaries and resonates more profoundly than ever. A commitment to learning is a commitment to a thriving, united nation."*
