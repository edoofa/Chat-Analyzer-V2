A new year brings forth a multitude of possibilities and fresh opportunities for growth and self-discovery.

This year, I have decided to practise more compassion, learn at least one new skill, and assist students who were unable to proceed further with their admission process in 2023, guiding them to build their envisioned future.

May I ask what changes or additions you have decided to make in the year 2024?

23/1/24, 8:33 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Can you help me understand that why do you specifically want to pursue Social Work?
23/1/24, 8:41 AM - +263 71 641 5156: The reason why l want to study social work is because l  desire to make a positive impact: Many people are driven by a genuine passion for helping others and making a positive difference in their lives. So l believe that social work provides an avenue to create meaningful change and improve the well-being of vulnerable individuals or communities.

Social work is considered a humanitarian profession, often centered around promoting social justice, equality, and human rights. So by pursueing  this field l will have a deep sense of empathy and a strong desire to support those who may face adversity or social injustices.
I also have interest in addressing social issues: and what l mean by this is that : Social work offers an opportunity to work directly with various social issues such as poverty, homelessness, domestic violence, mental health, child welfare, and substance abuse. Those who want to contribute to solving these complex problems in society often find social work as a fulfilling option. So that's the reason why l want to do social work
23/1/24, 9:19 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Duly noted Hilton,
It's wonderful to hear about your passion and motivation for pursuing a career in social work. Your desire to make a positive impact, contribute to social justice, and address pressing social issues aligns well with the goals and values of the sociology profession.
23/1/24, 9:22 AM - +263 71 641 5156: Yes
23/1/24, 9:27 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Hilton, first of all, I would like to help you understand that in India and many other countries Social work is considered a very niche course, and hence the amount of scholarship percentage offered for this course is very limited, that's the reason we do not cover this course under our scholarship, But we do understand that this field of work like Sociology/Social Work is very reputable and hence we recommend our students to pursue *BA in Sociology*, as globally considering this course is highly marketable, The reason being you would have more job opportunities plus you will also be able to fulfil you goal of bringing a positive impact to the society.
23/1/24, 9:28 AM - +263 71 641 5156: Okay it's okay l can do a BA in Sociology
23/1/24, 9:28 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Sociology is a broader academic discipline that studies society, human behaviour, and social institutions. Sociologists analyze patterns, relationships, and structures within society, aiming to understand social phenomena and contribute to theoretical frameworks. While sociology provides valuable insights into social structures and dynamics.
23/1/24, 9:29 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Both sociology and social work play important roles in addressing social issues, Sociology tends to focus on understanding the broader social context, developing theories and emphasizes practical interventions and support for individuals and communities.
23/1/24, 9:29 AM - +263 71 641 5156: Okay l understand
23/1/24, 9:31 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: So Shall I brief you about this course in detail?

23/1/24, 10:17 AM - +263 71 641 5156: Okay can l have the email
23/1/24, 10:18 AM - +263 71 641 5156: Ain't number 1 and two the same
23/1/24, 10:19 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: You will need to write an email, To academicboard@edoofa.com, And please do the same at the earliest, So that I can continue with your academic process ahead on priority
23/1/24, 10:19 AM - +263 71 641 5156: Ohh okay
23/1/24, 10:29 AM - +263 71 641 5156: I have sent the email
23/1/24, 10:42 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Duly noted Hilton, In the meantime, let us move forward with our discussion. To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is *B.A. (Hons.) in Sociology* and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
23/1/24, 10:43 AM - +263 71 641 5156: Yes that's accurate
23/1/24, 10:46 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: As we proceed with your university admission, our main focus is on completing your scholarship application and sharing it with universities tailored to your chosen course, endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.

As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will handle the submission of your application to various universities. Once they evaluate your eligibility, if found suitable, you'll receive a comprehensive offer letter detailing the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information ensures a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.

If multiple universities accept your application, it's important to note that practically studying at multiple universities is not feasible right?
23/1/24, 10:47 AM - +263 71 641 5156: Yes it's not right
23/1/24, 10:48 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
23/1/24, 10:49 AM - +263 71 641 5156: Okay understood
23/1/24, 10:58 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $1000. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
23/1/24, 10:58 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee.
23/1/24, 10:58 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
23/1/24, 10:59 AM - +263 71 641 5156: Yes that's true
23/1/24, 11:00 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
23/1/24, 11:04 AM - +263 71 641 5156: Yes we are
23/1/24, 11:12 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

1. *Tuition Fee*: $1800 per annum
2. *Food and Accommodation Fee*: $1000 per annum 

*Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum*

Registration Fee to be paid: $1000 (deadline within two weeks of issue of the offer letter, part of the university’s first-year fee and will be adjusted against the first-year cost of education $2800). I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?
23/1/24, 11:13 AM - +263 71 641 5156: So the registration fee is subtracted from the $2800
23/1/24, 11:27 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Yes please, that is correct!
23/1/24, 11:33 AM - +263 71 641 5156: Okay understood
23/1/24, 11:40 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $1000, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $1000 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
23/1/24, 11:41 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $1000 = $1800. This amount can be paid in two installments of $900 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India.
23/1/24, 11:41 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Subsequently, the remaining balance of $900 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
23/1/24, 11:42 AM - +263 71 641 5156: Ohh okay understood
23/1/24, 11:47 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Hilton, Please I can see that your parents are not following this discussion, Can yoou ask them to go through the same as well?
23/1/24, 11:47 AM - +263 71 641 5156: Okay l will

23/1/24, 1:05 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Duly noted please, And when do they come back from work Hilton?
23/1/24, 5:13 PM - +44 7471 319300: Good day
23/1/24, 5:44 PM - +44 7471 319300: I understand
23/1/24, 7:26 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: I have noted all your responses for the day, Since my working hours for the day are over now, *I have therefore scheduled your session for 09:30 AM CAT tomorrow*

24/1/24, 8:14 AM - ~ Anti- 3ocial💀 added +263 78 726 4246 and +44 7471 319300
24/1/24, 8:14 AM - +263 71 641 5156: Okay thank you
24/1/24, 8:35 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Can you please introduce who all have you added to the group Hilton?

24/1/24, 8:38 AM - +44 7471 319300: Good morning
24/1/24, 9:21 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Good Morning Mr and Mrs Nyamadzawo
24/1/24, 9:21 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: So shall we begin with the session?
24/1/24, 9:51 AM - +263 78 726 4246: Yes
24/1/24, 10:44 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: I hope Hilton has briefed you about the details shared so far duringthe session?
24/1/24, 10:55 AM - +263 71 641 5156: Yes
24/1/24, 12:45 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
24/1/24, 12:45 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
24/1/24, 12:45 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
24/1/24, 12:46 PM - +263 71 641 5156: Understood
24/1/24, 1:55 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.
24/1/24, 1:55 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
24/1/24, 1:56 PM - +263 78 726 4246: Registration fee is this not the 300 which we paid last yr
24/1/24, 1:57 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Please do you mean the Enrollment fees?
24/1/24, 1:58 PM - +263 78 726 4246: Is it different
24/1/24, 1:58 PM - +263 78 726 4246: I stand to be guided
24/1/24, 2:00 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Yes please
24/1/24, 2:04 PM - +263 71 641 5156: Okay
24/1/24, 2:06 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Alright please, Now with this, we are done with step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
24/1/24, 2:06 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one.
24/1/24, 2:06 PM - +263 78 726 4246: Yes
24/1/24, 2:06 PM - +263 71 641 5156: Yes,
24/1/24, 2:07 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
24/1/24, 2:13 PM - +263 71 641 5156: Okay
24/1/24, 2:16 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Yes, indeed Hilton. The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
24/1/24, 2:18 PM - +263 71 641 5156: Ohh okay
24/1/24, 2:22 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received special news for the students of the 2024 admission intake. May I know if you are excited to know the news we have for you?
24/1/24, 2:23 PM - +263 71 641 5156: Yes l am
24/1/24, 2:48 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: I am happy to see that you are excited. After speaking with thousands of students and parents who completed their admission process before you, we realized that the current economic situation in African countries makes it a bit challenging for parents to pay the full registration fee at once. 

In response to the same challenge, we had a detailed discussion with the academic board and university official. As a result, we developed a solution to alleviate the financial burden of the parents specifically for the registration fee due of $500 to $1000.
24/1/24, 2:48 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: We at Edoofa are thrilled about this development, and I believe it will significantly help all of our students and their families. Are you aware of the solution?
24/1/24, 2:49 PM - +263 71 641 5156: Yes
24/1/24, 2:59 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: The registration fee can be paid either in two equal parts(The first half within 15 days and the second half within 30 days) or in one go itself.

Are you clear with the details?
24/1/24, 3:00 PM - +263 71 641 5156: Yes
24/1/24, 3:01 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: For instance, if your deadline is set for January 10th of February, 2024, and your registration fee stands at $1000, you'll need to make a payment of $500 on or before the 10th of February, 2024. The remaining $500 should be paid by February 28 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
24/1/24, 3:02 PM - +263 71 641 5156: No l have understood
24/1/24, 3:06 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
24/1/24, 3:06 PM - +263 71 641 5156: I don't have any queries
24/1/24, 3:10 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: @263787264246 As Hilton's guardian, Are you excited to initiate the process? For the current round of admissions, only 31 scholarship seats are available and hence let us begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the payment plan offered for the registration fee. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
24/1/24, 3:18 PM - +263 78 726 4246: Yes
24/1/24, 3:40 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Glad to hear that please, So to get Hilton's University letter prepared,

2/2/24, 10:40 AM - +263 71 641 5156: No am not
2/2/24, 11:03 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: If you can make the payment from Harare, that case the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
2/2/24, 11:03 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
2/2/24, 11:03 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
2/2/24, 11:03 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Shorwi’s FBC Bank for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send.

LPU is one of the best universities in India and it has been ranked in the top 80 universities worldwide, because of its international tie-ups, the exposure a student gets at the university is indomitable. 

It has a campus of 800 acres, with over 100,000 students studying from all over the world. Students from LPU are placed at Microsoft, Google, IMF, Work Bank, and many more. It has spent a lot of money building the infrastructure so that a quality service can be given to the students.

The students at LPU are not only looking for Academics but holistic development is given the utmost importance. The students there can join clubs to represent the University in various competitions like MUN, Debate, and Sports along with various other activities.
2/2/24, 3:11 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: As you can not visit the campus and see it for yourself, in that case, you can take a virtual tour of the campus, it is open 24/7 and is never off. Here is the link for the same - https://www.lpu.in/virtual-tour/

29/2/24, 7:48 AM - Vilsha Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Hilton

I am Ms. Vilsha and I serve as the Head of Admissions at Edoofa. I was having a discussion with Mr. Jyotishman early in the morning and he mentioned that you wish to make the payment of your balance university registration fee today and hence needed assistance for the same? Is my understanding correct here?
29/2/24, 7:49 AM - +263 71 641 5156: Yes it is
29/2/24, 7:49 AM - +263 71 641 5156: Good morning ma'am
29/2/24, 7:51 AM - Vilsha Edoofa: I see Hilton and thank you for the confirmation. You can make the payment of your fee using the same mode of payment that you used before - Mukuru Payment through Mr. Shorwi. Do you have the same details with you?
29/2/24, 7:51 AM - +263 71 641 5156: Yes l do have the details
29/2/24, 7:53 AM - +263 71 641 5156: So since am now using Mukuru can l please ask for some days to make the payment because l left my ID card in Bulawayo and am in Harare but am going back there this weekend. Is that possible?
29/2/24, 7:54 AM - +263 71 641 5156: Because they need my ID card for me to make the payment
29/2/24, 7:54 AM - Vilsha Edoofa: Perfect Hilton. As per my records, your registration fee at LPU is $700 and since the transfer charges are 12.5% of the amount you wish to share, the total amount that you had to deposit to Mr. Shorwi becomes $788 and since you have already made a payment of $350, the balance amount becomes $438 which needs to be cleared at the earliest.
29/2/24, 7:56 AM - Vilsha Edoofa: I see Hilton, in case you do not have your National ID, you can use your parents ID to make the payment. Alternatively, if you feel making the payment through Mukuru would be challenging, you can make the payment through FBC Bank as well. Do you have the details for FBC Bank with you?
29/2/24, 7:56 AM - +263 71 641 5156: No l don't
29/2/24, 7:57 AM - +263 71 641 5156: Ma'am all my parents are in the UK so am not able to use their ID
29/2/24, 7:58 AM - Vilsha Edoofa: That is alright Hilton, I understand and thank you for sharing this. In such a case let me share our associate Mr. Charles’s FBC Bank account details with you and you can go ahead and make the payment through FBC Bank. 

Account Holder - Charles Jerera
Account Number - 5333 0380 1404 8828
Bank Name - FBC Bank Limited 
Branch - Masvingo
29/2/24, 7:59 AM - +263 71 641 5156: So l will be paying or depositing w
438usd straight into Mr Charles account
29/2/24, 8:00 AM - Vilsha Edoofa: Yes, that is absolutely correct Hilton. You would be making a deposit of $438 to Mr. Charles’s account and that includes the International Transfer Charges as well. The FBC Bank mode is quite affordable as compared to Mukuru since there are no Mukuru Charges Involved.
29/2/24, 8:01 AM - +263 71 641 5156: Ohh okay noted
29/2/24, 8:04 AM - Vilsha Edoofa: Yes, Hilton. Once you are able to make the deposit of your registration fee, please ensure that you share the payment receipt with us here in your admission group so that we can get the payment confirmed by the accounts team and update the university officials accordingly.
