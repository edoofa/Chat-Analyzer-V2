23/1/24, 3:57 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
23/1/24, 3:57 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

23/1/24, 3:59 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps-
23/1/24, 3:59 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
23/1/24, 3:59 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.
23/1/24, 3:59 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I hope you are following?
23/1/24, 4:00 PM - +263 78 751 4112: yes maam i am following
23/1/24, 4:00 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -
23/1/24, 4:00 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process, the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
23/1/24, 4:01 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.
23/1/24, 4:01 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I hope these are clear as well?
23/1/24, 4:02 PM - +263 78 751 4112: Yes maam they are clearly

23/1/24, 4:05 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
23/1/24, 4:05 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding until you are ready, shall we start with our discussion with me individually?

If you don't mind, could you please share your understanding of all four videos with me so that I can assist you in expanding upon them and help you ensure you are on the right path in your educational journey?
23/1/24, 7:42 PM - +263 78 751 4112: I understood that every student should be teachable and open minded, as students we should also follow Edoofa's instructions. The Edoofa's vision is not just aimed at getting students affordable quality education or making students employable through SEELS program however   is focused on increasing student's capacity for success this making students more responsible and independent. I understand that the Edoofa  program has invested alot of  time to identify good schools  and universities for passionate Edoofians.
23/1/24, 7:44 PM - Ashi Edoofa: May I know if you want to add anything else?
23/1/24, 7:44 PM - +263 78 751 4112: No ma'am
23/1/24, 7:45 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright dear, Let me also add to each video that you watched and help you summarize a few additional insights:
23/1/24, 7:45 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 1: Important Message for Enrolled Students*

The first video underscores the importance of two crucial qualities: open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions. Edoofa's vision for its students is to foster success in their careers, and promote responsibility, and independence. A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.
23/1/24, 7:45 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s Vision for You*

Edoofa's vision for its students is to provide them with employment opportunities and the skills necessary to become future leaders. The program places students above other candidates by investing significant time and effort into finding reputable, education-focused institutions rather than solely business-oriented ones.
23/1/24, 7:45 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

In the third video, it is highlighted that Edoofa's founders have dedicated over a decade to meticulously identify reputable educational institutions. Students are advised to cultivate the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to excel in the job market. All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to student's career goals.
23/1/24, 7:45 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools. It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.
23/1/24, 7:45 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In summary, these videos emphasize the significance of qualities such as open-mindedness, following instructions, and cooperation. Edoofa's vision is to empower students for successful careers and leadership roles by carefully selecting educational institutions. The SOP is a vital tool for effective communication and admission success. 

I hope you agree with all of this and were able to understand these by watching the four videos?
23/1/24, 7:47 PM - +263 78 751 4112: Yes ma'am I agree
23/1/24, 7:50 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Brilliant, Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
23/1/24, 7:53 PM - +263 78 751 4112: Yes ma'am we are on the same page
23/1/24, 7:55 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright, Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by tomorrow 12:30 PM.
23/1/24, 7:56 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded.

24/1/24, 12:15 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Nokuthaba, Wishing you a good day! 

May I kindly know if you have completed the academic interview questions ?
24/1/24, 12:19 PM - +263 78 751 4112: I am working on it maam
24/1/24, 12:23 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright dear, Once you are done please do let me know
24/1/24, 12:23 PM - +263 78 751 4112: Noted ma'am
24/1/24, 12:27 PM - +263 78 751 4112: Ma'am the audio I can send on the group
24/1/24, 12:27 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Yes dear
24/1/24, 12:31 PM - +263 78 751 4112: <Media omitted>
24/1/24, 12:44 PM - +263 78 751 4112: 2.Yes there is a social structure that constraints an individual action. As social structure can be in terms of classes which include lower class,middle class and higher class. It is not a fragment of our imagination but it actually exists, in the sense that how people get treated from those different social classes in terms of opportunities in life.Yes, it does constract an individual's  actions for instance our African society when you are seen walking and your dressed in  an unacceptable manner people will mock you and that will eventually give you a bright light that I am not dressed properly I should dress an an acceptable manner therefore this giving day light that the society actually figment to our imaginations. For example in some societies when a child does not greet greet elders that child is taken for a society hearing as within the Ndebele society a child is expected to greet elders and not vice versa.
24/1/24, 1:00 PM - +263 78 751 4112: 3.The relation between sociology and Economic is inseparable. Sociology deals with relations between humans and society.Economics actually helps understand the pattern of wants and consumption of resources. The focus of study in Sociology is society and behaviour of human in society. Sociology is particularly important in economic interaction and the structure of the society which suffers from many problems that cannot be  treated or diagnosed expect in an economic frame work and vice versa. Sociology it has a wider scope because it studies all types of social relations whereas economics has a narrow scope because it studies economic instructions and economic activities of a man. Sociology is abstract in nature. Its variables are very difficult to measure whilst economic is concrete in nature. Its variables are easy to measure. Sociology is general sciences and economics is special science. Sociology is is young science and economics is age old science. Sociology is a core subject matter of society and it study man as science animal whilst economics concentrates on production and distribution of goods and services oand the basic subject matter and study man as a wealth disposer.
24/1/24, 1:15 PM - +263 78 751 4112: 4. The institutions actually work with a positive effect. The institutions include schools,  day care, universities. For example a school encourages children to respect their elders and teach them about culture, morals and ethics. At school children are taught to greet visitors this will help them know and understand that elders are to be respected for example it is even written within the Holy Bible that children should obey their parents as it is the first commandment. Institutions also encourage a positive effect mind as it encourages students to love one another this is exemplified by a child who learns a classmate with a pen or with explanations when a classmate does not understand. The institutes actually work with a positive mind as they teach students culture this is best exemplified by morning devotions which are done every day in the morning before lessons begin where students are expected to pray and also sing songs.
24/1/24, 1:59 PM - +263 78 751 4112: 5. Primary group can be defined as a social group that is charaterized by intimate,  face to face and continuous relations. They usually have strong importance in an individual's social life. Examples of primary groups include families,  friends, peers, neighbours,  classmates just but to mention a few. Furthermore our belonging to primary groups and out association with their members often shape our core social identity. According to Lee {1964 page 26} he called primary groups " the nursery of human natur"e meaning that they play a fundemantal role in teaching individual human nature. Therefore the functions of primary groups include social support and facilitating socialization. Similarly, primary groups such as families and relatives can facilitate individual's socialization process by making them learn and internalize social norms and values.Secondary groups is a large group of people who share a purpose and work toward common interest or goal.  The basic examples of secondary groups include students and their teacher in classroom and workers and thier supervisors in an office. These secondary groups are experienced by most people at some point,  which makes them the most relatable. The structure , goals and location of a secondary group are it's primary distinguishing categories.  Secondary groups has got three characteristics which include structure, goals and location.

24/1/24, 2:05 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your response. With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey.
24/1/24, 2:05 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Before we proceed to the next stage, I'd like to assist you in getting started with your EWYL Journey. Based on your EWYL application form, you are scheduled to commence your EWYL journey on Tuesday (30-Jan-2024).
24/1/24, 2:05 PM - Ashi Edoofa: With your intention and commencement date in mind, we have already communicated this information to the EWYL team. They are prepared to initiate your EWYL program on Tuesday, as previously agreed upon.

To kick start the process, your dedicated EWYL Mentor has established your EWYL Group and shared the invitation link with us. Here's what you and your parents/guardian/sponsor need to do:

Kindly schedule my session for the same date so that I can maximize the benefits and start on the right track.*
24/1/24, 2:06 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Once you start with the EWYL Program and are able to connect with your mentor, please update the same here as well by sending the below message -

*Hello Admission officer, I am now in touch with my EWYL Mentor. The name of my Mentor is _________ and he/she has scheduled my session for ________*(mention the date)
24/1/24, 2:08 PM - +263 78 751 4112: Noted ma'am
24/1/24, 2:10 PM - Ashi Edoofa: With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey. we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*.
24/1/24, 2:10 PM - Ashi Edoofa: However, before we do the same, I was going through your scholarship application file and noticed that you are supposed to make the payment of your remaining part of Edoofa Enrollment fee before 18th February, 2024. Hence, I thought of sharing a gentle reminder with you and try to understand how your preparation has been so far? Have you been able to align your preparations in the right direction?
24/1/24, 2:13 PM - +263 78 751 4112: Yes ma'am we are paying the remaining balance on the first week of February
24/1/24, 2:14 PM - +263 78 751 4112: I have joined the group but they haven't sent anything
24/1/24, 2:16 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. We will reconnect with each other a few days before your due date to take a follow up on this and understand your preparations better.
24/1/24, 2:16 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Dear, They will connect with you soon
24/1/24, 2:16 PM - +263 78 751 4112: Okay maam thank you
24/1/24, 2:19 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In the meantime, let us move forward with our discussion. To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is *BA (Sociology)* and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
24/1/24, 2:20 PM - +263 78 751 4112: Yes it's accurate ma'am
24/1/24, 2:22 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
24/1/24, 2:22 PM - Ashi Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
24/1/24, 2:22 PM - Ashi Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
24/1/24, 2:23 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
24/1/24, 2:24 PM - +263 78 751 4112: Yes ma'am it is not possible for a student to study at several universities
24/1/24, 2:34 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
24/1/24, 2:34 PM - Ashi Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $1000. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
24/1/24, 2:34 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
24/1/24, 2:39 PM - +263 78 751 4112: Yes ma'am we had discussed this
24/1/24, 2:43 PM - +263 78 751 4112: Hello Admission officer, I am now in touch with my EWYL Mentor. The name of my Mentor is Ms Ananya and he/she has scheduled my session for 30thJanuary2024(mention the date) <This message was edited>
24/1/24, 2:48 PM - Ashi Edoofa: It's wonderful to hear that you've connected with your EWYL Mentor, Ms. Ananya, and that a session has been scheduled for 30th of January. This is a significant step in your journey, and I want to express my heartfelt congratulations to you for taking this initiative.

Wishing you all the best as you begin this exciting chapter. May it be filled with learning, personal growth, and, above all, a genuine sense of accomplishment.
24/1/24, 2:49 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
24/1/24, 2:52 PM - +263 78 751 4112: Thank you maam
24/1/24, 2:53 PM - +263 78 751 4112: Yes ma'am we are on the same page.
24/1/24, 2:57 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

1. *Tuition Fee*: $1800 per annum
2. *Food and Accommodation Fee*: $1000 per annum 

*Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum* <This message was edited>
24/1/24, 2:58 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Registration Fee to be paid: $1000 (deadline within two weeks of issue of the offer letter, part of the university’s first-year fee and will be adjusted against the first-year cost of education $2800). I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?
24/1/24, 2:58 PM - +263 78 751 4112: That's understood ma'am
24/1/24, 3:00 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $1000, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $1000 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
24/1/24, 3:00 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $1000 = $1800. This amount can be paid in two installments of $900 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $900 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
24/1/24, 3:01 PM - +263 78 751 4112: Noted  ma'am
24/1/24, 3:02 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
24/1/24, 3:02 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
24/1/24, 3:03 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
24/1/24, 3:04 PM - +263 78 751 4112: Noted ma'am
24/1/24, 3:06 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
24/1/24, 3:08 PM - +263 78 751 4112: I don't have any queries ma'am we may proceed
24/1/24, 3:20 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright please, Now with this, we are done with step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
24/1/24, 3:20 PM - Ashi Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one.
24/1/24, 3:20 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
24/1/24, 3:21 PM - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
24/1/24, 3:23 PM - +263 78 751 4112: Indeed I am driven to secure my scholarship seat.
24/1/24, 3:37 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Yes, indeed dear. The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
24/1/24, 3:37 PM - Ashi Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received special news for the students of the 2024 admission intake. May I know if you are excited to know the news we have for you?
24/1/24, 3:42 PM - +263 78 751 4112: Yes maam I am excited to hear the news.
24/1/24, 3:44 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am happy to see that you are excited. After speaking with thousands of students and parents who completed their admission process before you, we realized that the current economic situation in African countries makes it a bit challenging for parents to pay the full registration fee at once.
24/1/24, 3:44 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In response to the same challenge, we had a detailed discussion with the academic board and university official. As a result, we developed a solution to alleviate the financial burden of the parents specifically for the registration fee due of $500 to $1000.
24/1/24, 3:44 PM - Ashi Edoofa: We at Edoofa are thrilled about this development, and I believe it will significantly help all of our students and their families. Are you aware of the solution?
24/1/24, 3:46 PM - +263 78 751 4112: No ma'am I am not aware of the solution.
24/1/24, 3:46 PM - +263 78 203 7493: Would like to know the solution
24/1/24, 3:54 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That is alright, let me share the same. With respect to the conversation we had with the academic board and the university officials, we requested them to allow the students to make the payment of their registration fee in two parts within a span of 45 days thereby reducing the financial pressure.
24/1/24, 3:54 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Here's how it works: Consider that your registration fee is $1000. After you will receive the offer letter, the first part of the registration fees which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, i.e. $500 needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university (For most of the universities 15 days). Subsequently, the second part of $500, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
24/1/24, 3:54 PM - Ashi Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for January 25, 2024, and your registration fee stands at $1000, you'll need to make a payment of $500 on or before January 25, 2024. The remaining $500 should be paid by February 25 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
24/1/24, 3:56 PM - +263 78 751 4112: No ma'am
24/1/24, 3:58 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
24/1/24, 4:00 PM - +263 78 751 4112: I have a question maam
24/1/24, 4:00 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Sure dear, Please go ahead
24/1/24, 4:01 PM - +263 78 751 4112: So when doing the visa process you pay different money or it's all covered for in the registration fee
24/1/24, 4:05 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your query with me dear, The Visa cost and Flight tickets are catered by the parents only however we will help you in achieving  the Visa and book the Flight Tickets
24/1/24, 4:08 PM - +263 78 751 4112: Okay I have understood ma'am
24/1/24, 4:09 PM - +263 78 203 7493: Have followed
24/1/24, 4:10 PM - +263 78 203 7493: Thank you for clarifying
24/1/24, 4:12 PM - Ashi Edoofa: You are welcome!
24/1/24, 4:12 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Are you excited to initiate the process? For the current round of admissions, only 31 scholarship seats are available and hence let us begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the payment plan offered for the registration fee. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
24/1/24, 4:13 PM - +263 78 751 4112: Yes ma'am I am excited for the next stage
24/1/24, 4:14 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation and with your approval, we will now proceed with the preparations for the application and submit it to the universities recommended by the academic board, tailored to your chosen course. 

Once we receive updates from the universities, we will quickly reconnect with you and share all the relevant information.

Your peace of mind is of utmost importance to us, and we are fully dedicated to providing you with all the support you may require.

28/2/24, 8:05 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Sure dear, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
28/2/24, 8:05 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
28/2/24, 8:11 PM - +263 78 203 7493: Good evening
We stay in Bulawayo
28/2/24, 8:16 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright please, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Charles FBC Bank for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send.
28/2/24, 8:16 PM - Ashi Edoofa: If making the payment through Mr. Charle’s is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

Account Holder - Charles Jerera
Account Number - 5333 0380 1404 8828
