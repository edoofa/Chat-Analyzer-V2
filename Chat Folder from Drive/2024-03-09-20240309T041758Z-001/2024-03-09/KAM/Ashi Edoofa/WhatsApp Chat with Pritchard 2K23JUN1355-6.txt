I trust this message finds you in good health and that you had a delightful Christmas. Following up on our earlier discussion, I understand that you are scheduled to make a deposit on the 29th of December. I'm reaching out to check on your preparations and to ask if there are any updates or progress you'd like to share with us?
27/12/23, 2:24 PM - +263 78 561 4353: Good afternoon Admissions team,

We are preparing the fee we are going to pay on the following days
27/12/23, 4:20 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Pritchard.

I hope you are doing well. Thank you for letting me know that. However, as we are currently in the holiday season, there's a possibility that you might encounter unforeseen challenges at the bank. 

To be on the side of caution, we advise making the payment a day in advance. This precaution ensures you have a backup day, minimizing the risk of losing out on the entire opportunity. I trust you have taken note of our recommendation?
27/12/23, 6:31 PM - +263 78 580 0065: Good evening,
Hope you are doing well. 

I understand what you mean let me convey the message to my parents.
27/12/23, 6:39 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for asking, I am doing great. Surely you can do that.
27/12/23, 9:12 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Pritchard,

I hope this message finds you in good health. I'm getting in touch to ask about the specific date you intend to pay the final portion of the registration fee. The university officials have requested this information, and I need to provide them with an update. Could you kindly share your planned payment date with me? This information would be very helpful.
28/12/23, 7:40 AM - +263 78 580 0065: Good morning, 
Hope you're doing well. 

Since my Guardian is not  connected with us here in the group let me reach out to him with the message I will get back to you providing an update.
28/12/23, 3:34 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Pritchard. 

I hope you are doing well. Thank you for asking, I am doing great. It is alright please, may I know if you were able to connect with your Guardian, since your deadline stands tomorrow?
28/12/23, 3:57 PM - +263 78 580 0065: Not yet connected with the Guardian, we're under weather it is raining everyday, so I'm going to complete the fee tomorrow. Today I can't manage,
28/12/23, 3:58 PM - +263 78 580 0065: Maybe I can get connected later today,
28/12/23, 3:59 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that. I wish him a speedy recovery. I shall wait for an update from your end tomorrow.
28/12/23, 4:00 PM - +263 78 580 0065: That's alright,
29/12/23, 8:02 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Pritchard.

I hope you're doing well. I've been awaiting a response from you but haven't received an update yet. I wanted to reach out again to check on the status of the payment, as today is your deadline and you shared that you will be making the deposit today. It's important for us to provide an update to the university officials accordingly.

Could you please let me know if you were able to complete the payment today? Your response would be greatly appreciated as it will help us stay on track with the university's requirements?
30/12/23, 7:34 AM - +263 78 580 0065: Good evening Admission Officer,
Hope you're doing well,

I would like you to be informed of my current situation regarding my payment of the registration fee today,
I know this is going worse for me and I'm feeling sorry. You know I would not have been successfully connected to my Guardian since the day you shared that the deadline is going to be 29th December, so he is out and his arrangements were in line with 30 December as the deadline date. It is a challenge with us here and this is due to bad weather in our region right now, So today I connect with my Guardian today morning and said he thought the date is 30th December. I don't know how can go forward, currently we have this problem.
30/12/23, 7:34 AM - +263 78 580 0065: The network is also a challenge right now we are not connected with people from different domains, this happening in our region.
30/12/23, 7:43 AM - +263 78 580 0065: Good morning Admission Officer,

I wanted to complete the payment yesterday but we were both confused with my Guardian, he thought the final date was going to be 30th December, I couldn't find a successful way to connect with him during the week and inform him about the current deadline day (29th December) this was due to bad weather we have limited connections right now  but he's making efforts to complete the payment today.

2/1/24, 1:36 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that. I completely understand your challenges here and it is alright please, I shall wait for your response today. <This message was edited>
2/1/24, 9:39 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I was expecting to hear back from you, but as there hasn't been a response and given that it's been a long day for me, along with the conclusion of our working hours, let's plan to reconnect tomorrow to continue our discussion. I'm optimistic that you'll be able to connect then. Have a great night, and looking forward to our conversation tomorrow.
3/1/24, 12:15 PM - +263 78 580 0065: Good morning  Ms. Kirti,

I'm sorry I didn't manage to connect with you yesterday, I was with my Guardian in the city ( Mutare), so time to have discussions was limited,

16/1/24, 12:16 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Pritchard,

I trust this message finds you well, and I hope you are in high spirits. In recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their A-Level results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey.
16/1/24, 12:16 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?

Hope you're doing well. 

Here's the details and I'm  waiting for an update from your end.
19/1/24, 7:04 AM - +263 78 580 0065: Meanwhile I wanted to discuss about the process ahead, my Guardian would like to be informed about the same because he want to know the costs so that can prepare for that. So as a family we all want to know about how much the VISA costs, the TICKET, and the remaining part of the tuition fee( $1500); how's it going to be paid to the university. Can you please help me with the information so that I can discuss them with my Guardian.
