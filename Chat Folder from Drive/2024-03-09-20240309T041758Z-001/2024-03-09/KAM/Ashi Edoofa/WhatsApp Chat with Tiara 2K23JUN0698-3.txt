I trust this message finds you well and in high spirits. As I was organizing my day today, I took the opportunity to review your scholarship application file. I observed that the remaining amount of $100 for your university registration fee is due by 5th of January. Consequently, I wanted to reach out to inquire about your preparations.

How is your preparation going forward? Have you been able to raise the outstanding amount of $100 by now?

Thank you for sharing the payment receipt for your university registration fee, we have duly noted it. Our accounts team is currently processing the same receipts for payment confirmation.

Once the payment is verified, we will update your scholarship application accordingly. Additionally, we will notify the university authorities about the payment for their records to ensure a smooth visa process.
16/1/24, 12:15 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Tiara,

I trust this message finds you well, and I hope you are in high spirits. In recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their A-Level results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey.
16/1/24, 12:15 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?
16/1/24, 9:39 PM - +263 71 528 9514: Okay Sir. Thank you. Below are the results.

Thank you for sharing your results, and congratulations on successfully clearing all your A-Level subjects! Your hard work over the past few months has truly paid off.

I am sure your family is immensely proud of your achievements. Your A-level results have been duly noted, and we will quickly add them to your scholarship application. This will enable us to engage in discussions with the academic board and chart the best course of action for your next steps.
17/1/24, 8:56 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Kindly allow us some time to thoroughly evaluate your results and plan the way forward. Once we have re-evaluated your application, along with all the other applications, we will reconnect with you to discuss the next steps in your academic journey.

8/2/24, 2:09 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Regarding your inquiry about the payment, you can proceed with making payments through Edoofa. As we await responses from additional universities we applied to on behalf of Tiara, the college finalization process is still pending. Upon finalization, you will receive the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL), enabling you to initiate the VISA process. I hope you were able to follow?

20/2/24, 10:24 AM - +263 71 528 9514: Furthermore I hv instructed by Mr Jyotishman Chakraborty to forward this on the platform ( his buss card) and to remind you to make a follow-up of an alternate option to be given to allow me to process a Visa since I once addressed my issue to you that I have a sponsor but want a visa for him to do a one payment for my tution

20/2/24, 10:25 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the above picture with us, I have duly noted the same
7/3/24, 9:33 AM - +263 71 528 9514: How are the admission officers hope i find you in good health. My issue is still to know how far have you gone with the processing of an AAL since i have stated that i have a sponsor to make a one payment, bt needs a VISA first so am on a hold but the last time a met with the admission Director in Harare Zimbabwe he promised in 3 weeks time something must have been done, but seems the time is overdue may you please assist .

7/3/24, 2:19 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for connecting with us today. To provide you with a recap of our discussions during the seminar:

Since the Zimsec results were released last month, we've diligently worked on your application to help you secure the admission acceptance letter. Please don't worry the university officials are currently working on the same. However, I would like to guide you here that you don't need a Visa or Acceptance letter to make a payment for your tuition fees. You can ask your sponsor to pay the amount accordingly. If you have any queries please do let me know.
7/3/24, 3:33 PM - +263 71 528 9514: I understand but on my issue the sponsor is the one giving me a condition to process a Vissa first so that he can pay for the tution and etc. In other words he will be certain that Tiara is deffinately coming to India i dont know if you understand my issue
7/3/24, 6:31 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for not connecting with you earlier. I was occupied with a meeting which was then accompanied by my dinner break, I would love to move ahead with the discussion, however, since it is past our available hours let us reconnect tomorrow at 08:30 am. I hope you will be available so that we can have a discussion have a great night ahead.
