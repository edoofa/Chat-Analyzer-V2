6/1/24, 12:37 PM - +263 71 616 0258: Sorry i was sent somewhere.. I'm back

4. $125 + $125

6/1/24, 12:42 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I understand please, Kindly recheck the last point, as the Admission and Processing Fee is $1000
6/1/24, 12:43 PM - +263 71 616 0258: Noted
6/1/24, 12:51 PM - Ashi Edoofa: As per the offer letter, MVN University has awarded a 90% scholarship on tuition fees. This is a significant achievement and will greatly reduce the financial burden on your family.

Also, coming to the accommodation fees, as you can see in the letter, he has also been awarded a 100% waiver on the accommodation expenses, this means that the accommodation provided will be free of cost throughout the stay at MVN University. This is a fantastic opportunity as it further contributes to making education more affordable, isn’t it?
6/1/24, 12:55 PM - +263 71 616 0258: That's great
6/1/24, 1:02 PM - Ashi Edoofa: As you can see in the offer letter from MVN University, after the scholarship on the tuition and sponsorship fee on accommodation fee, the remaining per annum cost of education that you would have to pay is:

1. Tuition Fee: $350
2. Accommodation Fee: $0
3. University Infrastructure Fee: $575
4. International Student Development Fund: $300
5. Examination Fee (Per Year): $125
6. EDP & Book Bank Fee: $250
6/1/24, 1:02 PM - Ashi Edoofa: With this, if you sum up all the components, you will be able to see that your per annum cost of education is $1600.

At the same time, as you see in the offer letter, there are two components for the first year that are one-time payments, which are the Sports Fee and the Misc. Fee. This means the total expenses for the first year amount to $1600 (tuition) + $250 (fees) = $1850.

It is important to note that this cost is applicable for the first year only. From the second year onwards, your annual cost of education will be $1600. I hope this clarifies things in a better way for you?
6/1/24, 3:48 PM - +263 71 616 0258: Yes this clarifies everything
6/1/24, 3:50 PM - Ashi Edoofa: If you have any questions on your mind or need further clarification, please feel free to bring them up. Also, now that you're aware of your per annum fee, let me share the list of facilities offered by the universities that are covered as per the university's fee structure:

1. Tuition Fee
2. Living Cost
3. Library Fee
4. Examination Fee
5. EDB and Book Bank
6. International Student Development Fund
7. 24-Hour WiFi Cost
8. Maintenance Fee, Water Bill, and Electricity Bill.
6/1/24, 3:50 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Please let me know once you have gone through my above message and when you are ready to continue with our discussion. I look forward to discussing how one can utilize the "Earn While You Learn" Program to make their education even more affordable and helping you understand the steps involved in securing this scholarship offer.
6/1/24, 3:53 PM - +263 71 616 0258: Please tell me more about the extra requirements.....

For example, a boarding school this side doesn't tell you the amount of groceries you need to buy that may sustain you the whole term, they just give u the basic list, so as for universities, what additional things do i need
6/1/24, 3:54 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I understand your query @263716160258, Although there is no such requirement which is needed. When you will be coming in India, we will connect with you to assist you further about this query.
6/1/24, 3:57 PM - +263 71 616 0258: Okay sure
6/1/24, 4:00 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $1600, let me also guide you on how we can make your education more affordable.

Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
6/1/24, 4:01 PM - Ashi Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn. 

The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. Is this clear to you?
6/1/24, 4:07 PM - +263 71 616 0258: Clear
6/1/24, 4:10 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that with hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.

With these earned credits, one can use this $1000 to cover a portion of his/her annual fee, which is $1600. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $1600- $1000 = $600, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.

This illustrates how one can effectively make their education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
6/1/24, 4:11 PM - +263 71 616 0258: Sure
6/1/24, 4:15 PM - Ashi Edoofa: It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.
6/1/24, 4:15 PM - Ashi Edoofa: With that said, let us now shift our focus to the registration fee of $1000 mentioned in your offer letter from MVN University. 

The registration fee we are discussing here is somewhat unique, especially for Edoofians. Unlike traditional international students, Edoofa students do not need to consider it as an additional cost to their annual education fees. 

Instead, it is considered a part of the first-year education cost. For you, the cost for your first year of education is $1850 and thus the registration fee of $1000 will be adjusted towards the same. Giving you a total of $850 for your university fees. I hope I am clear to you?
6/1/24, 4:17 PM - +263 71 616 0258: Clear
6/1/24, 4:19 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Moving forward with our discussion, as you can see in the offer letter, it's outlined that a student is required to submit a registration fee of $1000 within 15 days to secure their scholarship seat with the university. This sets the *deadline date as January 19th, 2024*.
6/1/24, 4:19 PM - Ashi Edoofa: However, in reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $100 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
6/1/24, 4:21 PM - +263 71 616 0258: Sure
6/1/24, 4:24 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Given the $100 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent you will be responsible for the remaining $900 of the registration fee. This $900 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of $450 before the first deadline date of *January 19th, 2024* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of $450 before the second deadline date of *February 19th, 2024* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
6/1/24, 4:24 PM - Ashi Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to *make the full payment of $900 within 15 working days, before January 19th, 2024*. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
6/1/24, 4:25 PM - +263 71 616 0258: Clear
6/1/24, 4:26 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
6/1/24, 4:26 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
6/1/24, 4:27 PM - +263 71 616 0258: Victoria Falls
6/1/24, 4:31 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
6/1/24, 4:31 PM - Ashi Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
6/1/24, 4:31 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
6/1/24, 4:32 PM - +263 71 616 0258: Okay sure
6/1/24, 4:34 PM - Ashi Edoofa: You are most welcome. Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
6/1/24, 4:34 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Charles for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference? <This message was edited>
6/1/24, 4:40 PM - +263 71 616 0258: Sure
6/1/24, 4:41 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Let me do the same. If making the payment through Mr. Charle’s is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

Account Holder - Charles Jerera
Account Number - 5333 0380 1404 8828
Bank Name - FBC Bank Limited

You can either make an initial payment of $450, or you can opt to pay the full $900 in one installment to expedite your admission process. Have you had an opportunity to consider which payment plan would be most suitable for you?
10/1/24, 7:07 PM - +263 71 616 0258: 450 first would do
10/1/24, 7:10 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know of this.

27/2/24, 3:36 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In order to make sure we are on the same page, I am sharing a break up of the amount you have paid and the amount remaining for your registration fees. Please do let me know if there is any discrepancy, 

You have paid $650 towards your registration fees, and the amount needed for the registration fees with charges is $1013. The remaining amount left to complete the registration procedure is $1013- $650 = $363. Please confirm if the amounts are correct here
27/2/24, 5:04 PM - +263 77 400 0348: Good afternoon.yes the amount is correct
27/2/24, 5:17 PM - +263 77 400 0348: But I have a question
28/2/24, 9:53 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Bekithemba, I hope you are doing well!

Thank you for sharing your response for my above message, I am glad to know that the above break up is correct. Kindly go ahead with your question. I am looking forward for your response. <This message was edited>
28/2/24, 9:54 AM - Ashi Edoofa: In the meantime, I would like to share that we at Edoofa are filled with energy and excitement which has been fueled by the successful meet and greet sessions we hosted at the Martin Luther King Family of Schools, Harare last week. 

The entire Edoofa Team returned from Zimbabwe with a wealth of learnings, experiences, and opportunities for our students. Even before the team returned to India, we were already eagerly planning our next visit, spurred on by the incredible connections and opportunities we secured for the students of Zimbabwe. <This message was edited>
28/2/24, 9:54 AM - Ashi Edoofa: However, before I get into our experiences and the opportunities that were provided to you and your family, I want to extend my sincere gratitude to you for being a part of the event and contributing to its success. 

I am also eager to hear about your experience at the meet and greet session. Whom were you able to connect with, and how do you envision your educational journey progressing from here?
29/2/24, 9:40 PM - +263 71 616 0258: Yes i attended the event and it was quite amazing.
I got the chance to visualize my self in India through watching Videos of the Edoofians that side.
The best part wch increased my security was hearing that Edoofa is connected to the biggest business men around India and some parts of the world, they aren't just meant to help us get Educated but also give us job opportunities since being an Edoofian will elevate one's status and their names will be much more favorable. This abolishes situations whereby most of my fellow Zimbabweans who study at home yet by the end of 4 years of their studies, they get nothing... But just a piece of paper (degree).Thanks to Edoofa by giving us employability opportunities.

As for my parents, they did not make it to the event, they were a bit busy.

All in all, honestly the event was amazing. Keep on hosting such events and i promise that the name of Edoofa will become something big.

Thank you for sharing your experience at the event. It's great to hear about your enthusiasm and the potential Edoofa holds for students like you. Your feedback is valuable, and it's wonderful to know that you found the event amazing. It's heartening to see how each student's journey unfolds, and our conversation today reaffirms the progress we've made as an organization with our students. Do you know how many students and parents attended the seminar over just three days?
1/3/24, 3:32 PM - +263 71 616 0258: I'm not sure on that one
1/3/24, 6:36 PM - Ashi Edoofa: there were over 2700 attendees and out of these 2,700 attendees, our team had the privilege of engaging in 30-minute one-on-one sessions with 487 students, including Mr. Austin, Ms. Vilsha, Mr. Abhinav, Mr. Jyotishman, and Mr. Piiyush. If I am correct, you were one of the fortunate students and were able to interact with Mr. Austin to discuss the way forward for your education. How was your discussion?
2/3/24, 1:07 AM - +263 71 616 0258: We had a discussion mostly based on the EWYL Program that i should connect Victoria Falls schools tho the Edoofa program.
We also had discussions about Universities Under Edoofa and he said that he'll make a plan and i will be transferred to one of the best University under Edoofa which is Lovely Professional University.

Well unfortunately he's always busy to speed up the process.
