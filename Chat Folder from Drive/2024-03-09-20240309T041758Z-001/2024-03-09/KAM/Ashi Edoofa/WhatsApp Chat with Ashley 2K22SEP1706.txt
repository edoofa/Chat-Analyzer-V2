16/1/24, 1:34 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Ashley,

I trust this message finds you well, and I hope you are in high spirits. In recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their A-Level results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey.
16/1/24, 1:34 PM - Ashi Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?
16/1/24, 4:02 PM - +263 77 661 8253: Thank you.

4/3/24, 1:13 PM - +263 77 661 8253: He had a head on with a wish on his way home from work and that is when his leg broke and the doctor said he needs a pin  of $600 and it's either he will walk again or he will not.
4/3/24, 2:14 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am sorry to hear about this dear, I wish him a speedy recovery. I can imagine how hard it can be for you. As you have mentioned that you couldn't get the expected result in ESAT exam, its fine dear as it was only the one opportunity. Remember that the Slice'Con grant is still pending right ?
4/3/24, 2:15 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Moreover, you can work with the EWYL team to earn the grants and self finance your education right ?
4/3/24, 2:28 PM - +263 77 661 8253: It will be tough for me since I will not have enough time to all the   tasks

4/3/24, 2:45 PM - +263 77 661 8253: It's hard for me because no one will even pay for my ticket,visa and even my tution fee .  I also had a sister who want O' level registration fee so it's difficult for my family to handle all this situation   so I think it will be better if I find something to do within the country
4/3/24, 2:48 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I can understand your situation dear, however you still have a lot of time to raise the finances for your education as your arrival is in August and upto August you don't have to pay any finances right ?
4/3/24, 2:52 PM - +263 77 661 8253: As for me there's no time because I can't even find a job .I prepared CVs but there's no response .l try each day but nothing is changing. I also want money to buy other stuffs like clothes e.t.c needed and  school leves which is becoming tough for me because I also have to help my parents with  my younger sister's fees as I'm the first born also because of the situation in our family .
4/3/24, 2:52 PM - +263 77 661 8253: This is going tough for me  ,I don't want to lie to you that I can afford
4/3/24, 3:20 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That's truly understandable dear, Getting a job is a challenging which is why I am asking you to focus on EWYL dear. You can earn the credits which will help you in paying your tutition fees
4/3/24, 3:22 PM - +263 77 661 8253: And this is not working for me .


I'm only begging for one favour from you to refund the money back maybe some day I will be thankful to you 🙏🙏🙏🙏
