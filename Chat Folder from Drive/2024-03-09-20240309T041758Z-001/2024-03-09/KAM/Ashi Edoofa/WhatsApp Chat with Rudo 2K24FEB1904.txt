1. *Visit Your School*: Approach your school administration or the designated authority for issuing such letters.

2. *Provide Necessary Information*: Ensure that the drafted letter includes essential details such as your identity as a student of the school, your subject combination for A Level exams, and your intention to sit for the exams this academic year.

3. *Printing and Signing*: Request the school to print the letter on official letterhead and have it signed/stamped by the appropriate authority.

4. *Include Authority Details*: Ensure that the letter contains the details of the signing authority, including their full name, contact number, and email ID.
5/3/24, 9:24 AM - Ashi Edoofa: This letter of recommendation is a crucial document that will support your application process. The Edoofa Academic Board will use those details to reach out to your school authorities and verify the recommendation letter before adding it to your scholarship application and hence I would like to inquire by when will you be able to share the same document with us?
5/3/24, 9:35 AM - +263 78 671 2870: Okay, when is this one due?
5/3/24, 9:37 AM - Ashi Edoofa: @263786712870 You are advised to share them as soon as possible. Also, I would like to know when you will be able to complete the forms I have shared with you ?

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
5/3/24, 9:54 AM - +263 78 671 2870: Yes I am ready to move forward
5/3/24, 9:56 AM - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
5/3/24, 9:58 AM - +263 78 671 2870: Okay I have seen the image
5/3/24, 10:01 AM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -
5/3/24, 10:01 AM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
5/3/24, 10:01 AM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.
5/3/24, 10:01 AM - Ashi Edoofa: I hope these two steps are clear?
5/3/24, 10:03 AM - +263 78 671 2870: They are very clear.
5/3/24, 10:04 AM - Ashi Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps-
5/3/24, 10:04 AM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
5/3/24, 10:04 AM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.
5/3/24, 10:04 AM - Ashi Edoofa: I hope you are following?
5/3/24, 10:06 AM - +263 78 671 2870: Before we move forward my business teacher has agreed to write my rec letter but she wants clarification on the need for her to talk about my subject combinations. Does she have to talk in depth or mention them and my achievements in those classes in passing?
5/3/24, 10:07 AM - +263 78 671 2870: I have understood these two steps
5/3/24, 10:11 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Ask them to mention the subject combination only
5/3/24, 10:11 AM - Ashi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps-
5/3/24, 10:11 AM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of *$500 to $1000.* Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
5/3/24, 10:11 AM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.
5/3/24, 10:11 AM - Ashi Edoofa: I hope these are clear as well?
5/3/24, 10:20 AM - +263 78 671 2870: Okay so for the sake of my parent @263772100473when should we expect to pay the $500 to $1000  and will it have to be paid as a one time lump some or in installments?
5/3/24, 10:25 AM - Ashi Edoofa: @263786712870 The payment for your registration process would be needed when you will receive your offer letter and yes there is a payment plan I will share the same with you soon in our upcoming session
5/3/24, 10:25 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Shall we continue ?
5/3/24, 10:25 AM - +263 78 671 2870: Yes we may move on
5/3/24, 10:26 AM - Ashi Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for the further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
5/3/24, 10:27 AM - +263 78 671 2870: Wait. Looking at this step does that mean the recommended 90-100% scholarship that I was offered is not guaranteed? <This message was edited>
5/3/24, 10:40 AM - Ashi Edoofa: @263786712870 The scholarship percentage is basically depends on various factors like your response for SOP and academic documents. Please note that the final scholarship percentage will be given by the university officials
5/3/24, 10:44 AM - +263 78 671 2870: Oh okay. So we can move forward in the process
5/3/24, 10:47 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life.

5/3/24, 8:34 PM - +263 78 671 2870: <Media omitted>
6/3/24, 4:04 AM - +263 78 671 2870: Angad and Vivek went through the basics of the online application process and they emphasized the value of being teachable and taking our varies life experiences as fuel not a reason to become entitled to charity. Furthermore, they mentioned how the goal of Edoofa is to take high achieving students (like myself) and give them affordable education and support to ensure that we become global citizens of value.
6/3/24, 4:11 AM - +263 78 671 2870: The fifteen years of Vivek and Angad’s experience has taught them things necessary for educational success at higher levels. These values are the backbone of  Edoofa’s vision. 

This is their vision summarized 
To give affordable and accessible education and professional education support, while creating a community of likeminded Edoofians. Furthermore Edoofa uses the EWYL program to teach us independence, Coachability, and the value of the right mindset.
6/3/24, 4:22 AM - +263 78 671 2870: Edoofa went through ten (now fifteen years) of carefully screening and selecting around 250 univeirsities based on their world class faculty, facilities, UGC/ NACC/ AIST accredited courses. 

I learnt that Edoofa takes a lot of time and effort into ensuring the child’s educational success.
6/3/24, 4:24 AM - +263 78 671 2870: The SOP is the subjective piece of the application the humanizes the applicant in the eyes of the admission board. It’s a great opportunity to make a great first impression, and it will enclose things found nowhere else in my application like my achievements, personality, goals, and vision for my BBA LLB degree.
6/3/24, 9:18 AM - +263 78 671 2870: Good morning I have finished watching the videos
6/3/24, 9:31 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Rudo, I hope you find this message in good health!
6/3/24, 9:31 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your thoughts about the videos, Let me also add to each video that you watched and help you summarize a few additional insights:
6/3/24, 9:31 AM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 1: Important Message for Enrolled Students*

The first video underscores the importance of two crucial qualities: open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions. Edoofa's vision for its students is to foster success in their careers, and promote responsibility, and independence. A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.
6/3/24, 9:31 AM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s Vision for You*

Edoofa's vision for its students is to provide them with employment opportunities and the skills necessary to become future leaders. The program places students above other candidates by investing significant time and effort into finding reputable, education-focused institutions rather than solely business-oriented ones.
6/3/24, 9:31 AM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

In the third video, it is highlighted that Edoofa's founders have dedicated over a decade to meticulously identify reputable educational institutions. Students are advised to cultivate the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to excel in the job market. All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to student's career goals.
6/3/24, 9:31 AM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools. It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.
6/3/24, 9:31 AM - Ashi Edoofa: In summary, these videos emphasize the significance of qualities such as open-mindedness, following instructions, and cooperation. Edoofa's vision is to empower students for successful careers and leadership roles by carefully selecting educational institutions. The SOP is a vital tool for effective communication and admission success. 

I hope you agree with all of this and were able to understand these by watching the four videos?
6/3/24, 10:24 AM - +263 78 671 2870: Yes I was able to understand when I was watching the videos
6/3/24, 10:40 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Brilliant, Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*.

6/3/24, 10:54 AM - Ashi Edoofa: @263786712870 Have you gone through my message ?

So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by tomorrow 12:30 PM.
6/3/24, 12:28 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier.
