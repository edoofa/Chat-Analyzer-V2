6/1/24, 12:05 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Bongani ,

In light of the offer letter you received, I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to you and your family on this remarkable achievement in your academic journey.

Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion for you and your family, and I can only imagine the excitement that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.
6/1/24, 12:05 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now that you have the letter in your possession, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you've had the chance to go through the offer letter thoroughly. 

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
6/1/24, 12:11 PM - +263 77 334 1355: Good afternoon yes i have go through  the later several times
6/1/24, 12:18 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that @263773341355 . As we proceed with today's discussion, we will get into the details of this specific offer letter. I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.
6/1/24, 12:18 PM - Ashi Edoofa: The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
6/1/24, 12:24 PM - +263 77 334 1355: Yes we can . I wanted to ask that . I only have one opportunity of university or this university is good civil engineering
6/1/24, 12:30 PM - Ashi Edoofa: @263773341355 You will receive the other offer letter, although it's one of the best university which have offered you scholarship.
6/1/24, 12:30 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
6/1/24, 12:30 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion -	

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4. You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
6/1/24, 12:30 PM - +263 77 334 1355: Ok thank you
6/1/24, 12:37 PM - +263 77 334 1355: 1.  $900
2.   3 year (6 semester)
3.  USD 300 
4.  Yes
6/1/24, 12:42 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Yes, that is absolutely correct and thank you for sharing your responses. As outlined in your offer letter, your course is a three-year program, with each academic year consisting of two semesters, totaling 6 semesters for your degree. 

With the scholarship offered, your tuition fee per semester reduces to $900, which means your annual tuition fee (calculated as $900 * 2) is $1800. I hope this clarifies the tuition fee structure for you?
6/1/24, 12:44 PM - +263 77 334 1355: Yes it is . Well explained  and clear
6/1/24, 12:52 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am pleased that we've been able to make progress. Moving forward, I would like to help you with a concise overview of the two accommodation options available at Galgotias University -
6/1/24, 12:52 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
6/1/24, 12:52 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You will be able to seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also go for accommodation independently and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
6/1/24, 12:56 PM - +263 77 334 1355: Ok i understand
6/1/24, 1:03 PM - Ashi Edoofa: It is great to hear that you're following our conversation closely. I am sure you can see that Galgotias University values students' well-being and takes a thoughtful approach to accommodation arrangements.

They understand the significance of students feeling comfortable in their environment to excel academically. Instead of imposing choices, the university allows students to visit the campus, assess their options, and make informed decisions about whether they prefer on-campus or off-campus accommodation.

I hope this clarifies the university's approach to accommodation for you?
6/1/24, 1:04 PM - +263 77 334 1355: Yes it is
6/1/24, 1:11 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Moving forward, as you can see in your offer letter, you have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with the registration fee due as well?
6/1/24, 1:14 PM - +263 77 334 1355: Yes it is clear
6/1/24, 1:19 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright please, it is reassuring to see you following through. Please allow me to share some great news with you. As you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300, mentioned in the letter, has been entirely waived under the Early Registration Scheme and the Endowment Plan. This means it will not be added to your overall cost of education.
6/1/24, 1:19 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on January 19th 2024*. I hope we are together so far?
6/1/24, 1:21 PM - +263 77 334 1355: Yes we are together
6/1/24, 1:26 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $100 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
6/1/24, 1:28 PM - +263 77 334 1355: Yes
6/1/24, 1:36 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $100 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $650  of the registration fee. This $650 can be conveniently paid in two instalments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$325 before the first deadline date of January 19th, 2024* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$325  before the second deadline date of February 19th, 2024* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
6/1/24, 1:36 PM - Ashi Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $650 within 15 working days, before *January 19th 2024.* 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
6/1/24, 1:39 PM - +263 77 334 1355: Yes it is clear
6/1/24, 1:49 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
6/1/24, 1:49 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
6/1/24, 1:59 PM - +263 77 334 1355: No am in bulawayo
6/1/24, 2:06 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
6/1/24, 2:06 PM - Ashi Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
6/1/24, 2:06 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
6/1/24, 2:32 PM - +263 77 334 1355: Ok thank you
6/1/24, 2:40 PM - Ashi Edoofa: You are most welcome. Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
6/1/24, 2:41 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Charles for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
6/1/24, 2:53 PM - +263 77 938 4365: Afternoon
6/1/24, 2:56 PM - +263 77 938 4365: I follow everything but there is a confusion on money ,through cash now it makes a lot of doughty in nowadays .

6/1/24, 3:07 PM - ~ Sabongani added +263 78 099 7557
6/1/24, 3:13 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Yes you can make payment through the same. If making the payment through Mr. Charle’s is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

Account Holder - Charles Jerera
Account Number - 5333 0380 1404 8828
Bank Name - FBC Bank Limited 
Branch - Masvingo
6/1/24, 3:25 PM - +263 77 334 1355: No i still have the details.  I think its easy for us as we are based in bulawayo
6/1/24, 3:29 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright, now moving forward, to facilitate a simpler understanding, let me provide a summary of all the fee components we have discussed and share the total cost of education that you are expected to incur at Galgotias University:

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1,800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1,800 + $200 + $800 = $2,800
6/1/24, 3:32 PM - +263 78 099 7557: afternoon..lm Bonganis mother .l use new number .l understand the cost is reasonable. but for the fees payment for date of 19 January ,can't we make it February please
6/1/24, 3:33 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Greetings @263780997557, I am pleased to connect with you today. May I know what is the concern in completing the payment by 19th of Jan ?
6/1/24, 4:19 PM - +263 77 938 4365: Concern is about early as on Monday l will send that balance of $150..
6/1/24, 4:21 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright dear, What is the concern in making the payment for registration fees ?
6/1/24, 4:28 PM - +263 77 938 4365: We will make payment of $325 before the first deadline date of January 19 ..counting from working days then the second before 19 February..we understand
6/1/24, 4:31 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to see that. Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $2800, let me also guide you on how we can make your education more affordable.

Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
6/1/24, 4:32 PM - Ashi Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn.

The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. I hope you have understood this?
6/1/24, 8:45 PM - Ashi Edoofa: As I was waiting for your response, Kindly do let me know when you will be able to reconnect with us so that we can complete our discussion. Looking forward for your response, Have a good night ahead!
6/1/24, 8:57 PM - +263 78 099 7557: good night ..tomorrow 1 pm
6/1/24, 8:58 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright dear, Let's connect tomorrow at 1pm
8/1/24, 3:51 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Bongani , Wishing you a good day! 

In regards to our previous conversation, I would like to know if you are ready for our today's discussion so that we can discuss about your offer letter. I've been looking forward to our today's discussion to plan the next steps in your admission process. Could you please share your response with us ?
8/1/24, 3:53 PM - +263 77 334 1355: Afternoon, yes i am ready for the discussions
8/1/24, 4:00 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to know that you are ready for the discussion dear, With this said, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a student. Imagine that you with your hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.

With these earned credits, you can use this $1000 to cover a portion of your annual fee, which is $2800. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $2800 - $1000 = $1800, which will need to be paid by your parents/guardians.

This illustrates how you can effectively make your education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous? <This message was edited>
8/1/24, 4:03 PM - +263 77 334 1355: Yes, I understand loud and clear.
8/1/24, 4:07 PM - Ashi Edoofa: It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education while balancing your academics. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.
8/1/24, 4:07 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, that you have all the details with you and understand the letter better, I would like to enquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
8/1/24, 4:09 PM - +263 77 334 1355: I would appreciate that.
8/1/24, 4:11 PM - +263 77 334 1355: No, there are no more queries .Thank you a lot
8/1/24, 4:13 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Welcome dear, Now to attend to last part of our discussion, let me share a few insights into Galgotias University with you -
