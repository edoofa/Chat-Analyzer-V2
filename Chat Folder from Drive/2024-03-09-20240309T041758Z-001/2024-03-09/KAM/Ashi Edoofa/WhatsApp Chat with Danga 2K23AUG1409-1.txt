8/1/24, 4:03 PM - Vilsha Edoofa: I would like to share an exciting milestone that India as a country achieved within the first week of 2024 – the successful *India's Chandrayaan-3 Engine Test.* This accomplishment is responsible for the third lunar mission, aiming to land a rover on the Moon's south polar region and conduct scientific studies that could check Moon's viability to sustain life. It signifies a significant scientific advancement, laying the groundwork for future progress.
8/1/24, 4:03 PM - Vilsha Edoofa: This achievement has not only pushed boundaries but also has inspired young minds all over the world to pursue their dreams. On the same note, I wanted to extend my heartiest wishes for the New Year to you and your family and check in to see how you and your family started your year?

I trust this message finds you well, and I hope you are in high spirits. In recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their A-Level results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey.
16/1/24, 2:10 PM - Ashi Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?

We at Edoofa are filled with energy and excitement which has been fueled by the successful meet and greet sessions we hosted at the Martin Luther King Family of Schools, Harare last week. 

The entire Edoofa Team returned from Zimbabwe with a wealth of learnings, experiences, and opportunities for our students. Even before the team returned to India, we were already eagerly planning our next visit, spurred on by the incredible connections and opportunities we secured for the students of Zimbabwe.
28/2/24, 9:10 AM - Ashi Edoofa: However, before I get into our experiences and the opportunities that were provided to you and your family, I want to extend my sincere gratitude to you for being a part of the event and contributing to its success. 

I am also eager to hear about your experience at the meet and greet session. Whom were you able to connect with, and how do you envision your educational journey progressing from here?
28/2/24, 1:40 PM - +263 77 771 4290: Actually l am confident enough to say this without fear that that was the greatest experience in my whole life .I couldn't imagine being near and close to the friendly and kind hearted person,the founder.Actually l was head over hills .

As if that was not enough what l liked most is the explanation they gave us ,they gave me and my parents a different view which we did not have back then ,l haven't met people who are so patient and passionate l really admired it .These were the best moments in my life memorable moments.

Can you imagine this was my first time to meet with indian people not just one but a group ,this only made my day ,as if there was a new page opened in my life 

I can't wait for another event like this where we have to be one big family , actually it was not only about  what l mentioned above but l managed to make a friend wow

I actually learn the importance of being patient and how crucial it is when you do something passionately with your heart as demonstrated by the team which came to zimbabwe
I actually see my educational journey a complete success
28/2/24, 2:18 PM - Ashi Edoofa: It's wonderful to hear about your incredible experience meeting the founder and the team. Your enthusiasm and admiration shine through your words.
