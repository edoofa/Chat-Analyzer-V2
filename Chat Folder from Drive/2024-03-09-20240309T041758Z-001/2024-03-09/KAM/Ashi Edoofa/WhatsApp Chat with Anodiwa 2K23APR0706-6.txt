26/12/23, 4:02 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Anodiwa !

I hope you are doing well and I find you in high spirits. After our previous discussion, I am sure you and your family were filled with anticipation regarding the opportunity presented by Quest Group of  Institutions.

Receiving the university's offer letter is indeed a significant milestone, and I can imagine the excitement that must have accompanied the anticipation of this moment.

Looking forward, I would like to enquire if you and your family had an opportunity to review and discuss the offer letter from Quest Group of  Institutions as a collective?

4/1/24, 10:32 AM - Ashi Edoofa: With that said, as we continue to face these inconsistencies in our sessions, you have missed the deadline date for the registration process at Quest Group of Institutions. I want you to secure this offer letter to make your future dreams come true, as it has been my sole responsibility since I became your admission officer. So, if you are facing any challenges, please let me know so that we can find a solution and proceed with the detailed discussion of the offer letter and plan your finances together.

4/1/24, 12:38 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I understand dear that you are having financial concern at the moment and you are trying to complete the payment. Ideally, a student needs to make the payment of the university registration fee by the mentioned deadline as the seats are reserved for you and there are limited seats for this scholarship opportunity. I understand that you are facing financial challenges at the moment, and we will try our best to assist you. 

As you have not shared your concern with us earlier, I am bit concerned for you. Hence, I would like to understand your plans to complete the registration procedure, Could you please share it with us ?

Am happy you have shown and expressed much concerns for us. Financially we have not been stable lately. Given that we now have the two of them on board, Anodiwa and Anesu. We are trying our level best to make sure they both reserve their university seats. And Am proud as an Edoofian that with God everything positive is possible thanks to you. If you may give us upto end of January 2024 to complete registration processes payment for Anodiwa then we go onto Anesu's payments by the end of February 2024 Am sure we will be done. I hope you understand where we are coming from, given that our source of income as a sole proprietory family is meager, so insignificant and easily constrainable.

16/1/24, 9:44 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Proud Edoofians,

I trust this message finds you in good health. As we step into the second week of January, I wanted to reach out and share an exciting milestone that India as a country achieved within the first week of 2024 - the successful India's Chandrayaan-3 Engine Test.
16/1/24, 9:44 AM - Ashi Edoofa: This accomplishment is responsible for the third lunar mission, aiming to land a rover on the Moon's south polar region and conduct scientific studies that could check Moon's viability to sustain life. It signifies a significant scientific advancement, laying the groundwork for future progress.
16/1/24, 9:44 AM - Ashi Edoofa: This achievement has not only pushed boundaries but also inspired young minds all over the world to pursue their dreams. On the same note, I wanted to extend my heartiest wishes for the New Year to you and your family and check in to see how you and your family started your year?
16/1/24, 10:37 AM - +263 71 864 1364: Thank  you Ashie. We are all well and so delighted to hear the good explorative news. Thank you and yes we started our new year 2024 on a very busy schedule. Hoping that we will continue  in this mode raising funds to make sure our twin girls Anesu and Anodiwa  pursue  and achieve their dreams unstoppably
16/1/24, 10:39 AM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that @263718641364 . With great excitement and pride, I also want to share that over the past few days, the Edoofa team has been immersed in an exciting event we had in store for our students. Edoofa hosted a conference - the Symposium of Leaders, Innovators, and Creators at Edoofa, also known as 'SLICE-CON.'
16/1/24, 10:39 AM - Ashi Edoofa: The conference was attended by all the Edoofians of 2023 and a few senior Edoofians from previous batches. It focused on the art of creation, innovation, and, most importantly, the mindset required to make an impact in one's career.
16/1/24, 10:39 AM - Ashi Edoofa: During this Industrial Visit and the conference - SLICE CON, Corporate leaders, such as the CEOs and Co-founders from renowned companies like Rage Coffee, Sirona Hygiene, Jolin New York, and more, shared their insights and experiences. These individuals are at the helm of multi-millionaire brands, leading large marketing teams. Their presence added immense value, providing students with the opportunity to engage in transformative conversations.
16/1/24, 10:39 AM - Ashi Edoofa: We believe that interactions with such industry leaders can bring significant transformations to students' lives, enhancing their business acumen. Our Edoofians maximized this opportunity, having life-changing conversations with these influential figures. The main objective of the event was to emphasize the importance of thinking outside the box, and encouraging students to believe in themselves and their dreams. Before we discuss your admission journey further, I wanted to share a glimpse of the event, and I hope you are excited to attend similar events when you come to India.

Wish if we were also there to enjoy💥💥💥🔥anyway thank you and we pray that next time such events are held please don't leave us out. Create space and feasibility for us to participate as we are already part of the Edoofian family
16/1/24, 10:48 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing to hear your thoughts, we will indeed invite you in such events. Over the past couple of days, we also had the pleasure of conversing with some of our students who expressed their joy upon receiving their A-Level results.

Reflecting on my own school days, I vividly recall the mix of excitement and anticipation surrounding the result day. It is an important moment that shapes the path of one’s academic journey.
16/1/24, 10:48 AM - Ashi Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?
16/1/24, 5:14 PM - +263 71 694 6404: Hello ma'am
16/1/24, 5:16 PM - +263 71 694 6404: <Media omitted>
16/1/24, 5:22 PM - +263 71 864 1364: We are proud to say Anodiwa had the toughest time at school but managed to come up with 5 points. Let's chat and agree on terms whether she qualified for the course she wanted or not
16/1/24, 7:47 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your results with us. I noticed that your A-level results didn't turn out as we had hoped, particularly with the challenge in one subject. However, I want to take a moment to remind you that this result is not a reflection of your abilities or potential. It's simply a hurdle on your academic journey, one that you are more than capable of overcoming. <This message was edited>
16/1/24, 7:47 PM - Ashi Edoofa: It's important to remember that everyone faces setbacks at some point. What matters most is how we respond to them. This is an opportunity for growth and learning. Reflect on the experience, identify areas for improvement, and use this as a stepping stone towards future successes.
16/1/24, 7:47 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Rest assured, that you have Edoofa’s full support in navigating this phase. Whether it's discussing options for retaking the exam, exploring alternative career paths, or just needing someone to guide you, we are here for you. 

I have taken note of your results and I will add them to your scholarship application. This will enable us to engage in discussions with the academic board and chart the best course of action for your next steps.
16/1/24, 7:48 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Kindly allow me time till Monday to thoroughly evaluate your results and plan the way forward. Once I have evaluated your results, along with all the other applications for your university admission, we will reconnect with you to discuss the next steps in your academic journey.
16/1/24, 10:51 PM - +263 71 694 6404: Okay ma'am 
Thank you so much for the encouragement and  hospitality. I'm very grateful for the opportunity and If possible l would love to continue pursuing the course. Thank you again for your kindness and support
22/1/24, 2:14 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Good Day, dear parents and Anodiwa,
*I am Mr Austin, Senior Career Counsellor at Edoofa*
I hope you all are doing well

If you recall, I hosted your counselling and evaluation sessions, and you made me proud by qualifying for our prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program. I received results from all my students, happy and exhilarating with joy. Recalling our interaction together after a frantic search for your name I ended up messaging you today. I understand your calibre and had a discussion with the Admissions Head and have decided to *personally look after your admission process so that we can proceed with your application on priority through the best possible opportunities and exposures.*

Hence I request you to come online at the earliest and notify me so that I can guide you ahead.
22/1/24, 3:28 PM - +263 71 291 4917: Hello am online for an hour from now 1530hrs to 1630hrs. Can we proceed
22/1/24, 3:43 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Good to hear from you, Mr Chaurura!
22/1/24, 3:44 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
22/1/24, 3:44 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
22/1/24, 3:46 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: *Congratulations to Anodiwa on A-level results* At the same time, I was going through your Admissions Group and was shocked to see that you weren't able to complete the University registration process being a bright student and I still remember Anotiwa;s passion for career and goals, making her one of my favourite students.

May I know, what exactly happened due to which you weren't able to proceed and what are your plans for your choldren as of now?
22/1/24, 3:50 PM - +263 71 291 4917: That's great
22/1/24, 3:54 PM - +263 71 291 4917: We couldn't pay to reserve Anodiwas seat at one of the universities due to financial constraints. We now have two of them on enrolment. Anodiwa and her twin sister Anesu. We managed to pay the initial 200usd for Anesu and for Anodiwa we paid the initial 350usd plus 20usd making it 370usd.
22/1/24, 3:57 PM - +263 71 291 4917: January 2024 has not been quite good for us as we failed to raise the 300usd required to reserve Anodiwas seat at the said university. So we kindly asked for your kind Administration to allow us extend payments for the two to end.of February 2024 to enable us to clear Anodiwas 300usd and Anesus 150usd respectively. We got a nod from.your office and a dire promise to look I to the matter accordingly. Now as we awaited results for two girls, we were also waiting for a positive persuasive response from your respected office to allow us complete payments for two by end of February 2024
22/1/24, 4:03 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: I do understand the challenges and being a parent of two children who completed their A level, the struggles and sacrifices are really genuine and understandable. This is also the reason, I have taken this initiative to connect and discuss the way forward with you despite the huge rush of applicants!
22/1/24, 4:03 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Do you know we at EDOOFA received 2000 Applications in a Single Day just a week before and each day since then we are receiving not less than 1000 Applications each day from students seeking Scholarship? We were overwhelmed and had to reject more applications because of limited seats however were surely intrigued to know the reasons for such an immediate upsurge. Having conversations with my other students who are already preparing to arrive in India under the Edoofa Scholarship shared some mind-boggling Screenshots from the Fee Prospectus of the Universities in Zimbabwe. <This message was edited>

22/1/24, 4:04 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: I am shocked to compile these data for the Fee Structures of some famous Public Universities in Zimbabwe.

*Bindura University of Science Education (BUSE)* -https://www.buse.ac.zw/fees-structure/ - *($680 per term)*

*Chinhoyi University of Technology (CUT)* https://www.cut.ac.zw/welcome/assets/files/fees-structure/School%20of%20Engineering%20Science.pdf - *($535 per term)*

*University of Zimbabwe (UZ)* -https://www.uz.ac.zw/index.php/faculties/160-fac-of-medicine/med-deparrtments/305-med-dpt-of-comm *($523 per term)*

NUST -*($870 per term)*

*I am sure you and your family must have also discussed this while considering your children's higher education*
22/1/24, 4:17 PM - +263 71 291 4917: Yes we did and we know for sure these are real figures for the respective fees
22/1/24, 4:20 PM - +263 71 291 4917: That is why we had to seek scholarship.. apart from the fact that securing the place at such universities is cumbersome.  That being the major concern why we had to seek your audience in this regard. We direly need the twin girls to proceed and complete their tertiary education with Edoofa without fail. Please assist us wherever possible, flex the conditions to accommodate us the less privileged. That is my kind request. Only of there was a chance of me getting employed at the university probably all this was going to be feasible.
22/1/24, 4:43 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: I really understand the challenges and I will ensure your children receive the best and most affordable opportunities through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, Mr Chaurura!
22/1/24, 4:44 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: May I know the full name and Admissions group name of Anesu please
22/1/24, 4:45 PM - +263 71 291 4917: Wooow am more than proud to hear such wonderful news. Did you hlget the last part of my chat here👆🏻👆🏻👆🏻 *ONLY IF THERE COULD BE A CHANCE FOR ME GETTING EMPLOYED BY EDOOFA UNIVERSITY, PROBABLY ALL THE WORRIES WOULD VARNISH*
22/1/24, 4:46 PM - +263 71 291 4917: OK just a moment. I'm sending it in a few minutes

22/1/24, 5:39 PM - +263 77 581 7170: Thank you so much.

22/1/24, 5:47 PM - +263 77 581 7170: Thank you. All the academic qualifications I attained are ready if you so want me to share
22/1/24, 6:01 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: You are welcome and you may please share the same while we continue the session!
22/1/24, 6:02 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
22/1/24, 6:13 PM - +263 71 291 4917: Wooow powerful  hey this is splendid ✨️ 👌
22/1/24, 6:14 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
22/1/24, 6:14 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: *Let me share all families of students who are in India have gone through what you might be experiencing now. There was a stage of uncertainty and confusion where we guided them as Career Counsellors to ensure our learners fulfill their aspirations!*
22/1/24, 6:14 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Being a career counsellor, my aspirations for young learners like you are similar. I firmly believe higher education should combine the following for a learner to achieve their goals:-

Quality Education
Conducive Environment
Critical Thinking and Practical learning skills
Technological Literacy and Attachments
Cultural Awareness and Global Perspective
Career guidance, Mentorships, etc.

*However, not everyone achieves success. Do you know why*?
22/1/24, 6:19 PM - +263 71 291 4917: Sir Austin surely am touched. I wish my twin girls to realize their dreams sooner🎯
22/1/24, 6:29 PM - +263 71 291 4917: No
22/1/24, 6:50 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
22/1/24, 6:50 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Therefore, It is important to know the facts of Edoofa's guidance and uniqueness compared to the normal University approach.
22/1/24, 6:50 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: 1) *Personalized mentorship and guidance throughout your course:-* As your Career Counsellor, I have known you since the beginning of the process, understanding your interests, aspirations, family background and plans for your career, unlike a University officer who may come across your application for the first time and treats with the same importance like others. I personally understand where you come from and what is required for you to be successful.
22/1/24, 6:51 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
22/1/24, 6:51 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: 3) *Financial Support and Planning:-* With a flexible payment plan for registration fees spreading across 45 days, the remaining cost of education can be paid in two installments. Students are ensured to open Indian bank accounts so that parents can even deposit the fees in monthly installments.

22/1/24, 6:51 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
22/1/24, 6:51 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: These are aspects that no other organization or University possesses as of now, I hope you are looking forward to such an opportunity for your children's career, aren't you?
22/1/24, 6:52 PM - +263 77 581 7170: That's fine I will share them here as we proceed. Probably tomorrow
22/1/24, 6:57 PM - +263 71 291 4917: Definitely I am. This is just unhead of in normal procedural universities worldwide
22/1/24, 7:48 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: That would be fine!
22/1/24, 7:48 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Absolutely, Mr Charurura!
22/1/24, 8:18 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: To confirm our records: the course Anodiwa has been selected fr higher education is Bachelor of Business Administration and the intake is in August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information is accurate?
22/1/24, 8:19 PM - +263 77 581 7170: Very accurate Sir Austin
22/1/24, 8:39 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: As we discussed in the counseling session, the cost of education in India ranges from $6000-$8000 per annum which will be reduced to $1200-$1800 per annum through the Edoofa Scholarship Program *as I will be recommending Anodiwa's application for a higher quantum of scholarship.* Congratulations on securing the same. Now, let us assume,
22/1/24, 8:39 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: 1. *Tuition Fee*: $650 per annum
2. *Accommodation Fee*: $0 per annum (100% Sponsorship)
3. *Remaining Fee Components*: [Library Fee, Examination Fee, EDB and Book Bank, International Student Development Fund, 24-Hour WiFi Cost, Maintenance Fee, Water Bill, and Electricity Bill]: $1000 per annum

*Total Fee: Tuition Fee $650 + Accommodation Fee $0 + Remaining Fee Components $1000 = $1650 per annum.*

4. *Registration Fee to be paid:* $1000
22/1/24, 8:40 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: This means this registration fee will be waived off from the cost of education ($1650-$1000= $650) and this remaining fee of $650 is supposed to be paid within 3 days of arrival.

I hope this is clear
22/1/24, 9:08 PM - +263 71 291 4917: 🙏🏼🙏🏼thank you so much eysh I'm so proud God answered my prayers🪇🪇🪇
22/1/24, 9:08 PM - +263 71 291 4917: Very clear Sir. U mean Anodiwa should pay 650usd within 3 days of her arrival at the EDOOFA University In India
22/1/24, 9:09 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: You are most welcome!
22/1/24, 9:09 PM - +263 71 291 4917: Maybe you need to elaborate clearly on column 4, given your explanation underneath that *Registration fee will be waived...*
22/1/24, 9:11 PM - +263 71 291 4917: So total amount due as of now is *$650* and after this payment, which would be due this August 2024, Anodiwa would be good to go for the whole academic year. Is that correct Sir Austin??
22/1/24, 9:16 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: That is correct
22/1/24, 9:29 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Do you have other questions for me please?
22/1/24, 9:44 PM - +263 78 211 5564: Thank you so much for such an amazing gesture Mr Austin. If I may ask, is there any other payment we are going to pay from now for Anodiwa apart from the $650 indicted above Sir? If not at all, What are the next steps we have to take now as we try very hard to secure Anodiwa's amazingly discounted total fees of $650 for this entire Academic year August 2024-July 2025
22/1/24, 9:45 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: You are most welcome, I guess there is a misunderstanding in the case of Registration fee
22/1/24, 9:47 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: In the example, we considered the cost of education as $1650 and the registration fee as $1000 which would be waived from the cost of education which means you are supposed to pay the $1000 after receiving the offer letter and will be left with the $650 for the first year
22/1/24, 10:40 PM - +263 78 211 5564: All the same this is awesome. We are more than pleased for such a kind gesture. So as we speak now please   confirm that we are to look for 650usd payable wi" in August 2024 when Anodiwa will be admitted into the University??
22/1/24, 11:10 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
22/1/24, 11:14 PM - +263 71 291 4917: Thank you. Let us enjoy the viewing. Good night and sweet dreams Sir🪇🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼

25/1/24, 1:29 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Good Day Mr&Mrs Chaurura and Anodiwa
How are you doing?

I have received positive feedback from our Program Director after your interactions. Despite the less points in A level, he has made a special request to proceed at the earliest with the University offers. At the same time, Mr Gupta walked an extra mile to discuss with our Academic Board and University for a special recommendation for a higher quantum of scholarship considering your aspirations and passion towards the Edoofa Scholarship. This is an exceptional opportunity provided for Anodiwa despite the huge rush of applicants. You can expect the Offer Letter anytime from now. In case you have any questions, do feel free to reach out to me
25/1/24, 1:41 PM - +263 78 211 5564: Thank you so much sir.
No l don't have any questions for now sir
25/1/24, 8:23 PM - +263 71 291 4917: We are overwhelmingly overjoyed by the sacrifice the two of you  as Anodiwa's mentors and top Management/Directors in the  Edoofa Scholarship Programme, have taken to grace us with such a priceless offer. Surely the Goodness andMercy as well as the generous Grace of God has been  and I can boldly say it is with us and may it stay with us all in this endeavor to enlighten our non-seperable bond God has made among us through this Programme. We are forever grateful  to you Sir Austin for making this process  a success. I pray to the everliving God for your perseverence in this regard to remain spot-on to the dot.
25/1/24, 9:06 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
25/1/24, 9:20 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Good Evening to you all! 
You have one of the greatest news here with the arrival of an offer letter from MVN University with an outstanding 100% scholarship on tuition and Accommodation. Congratulations on this exemplary achievement Anodiwa and we look forward to you reserving your seat soon. 

Please go through the letter well, discuss within your family and let us connect at 6:40 pm CAT tomorrow to discuss the letter and further proceedings. Stay Blessed!
25/1/24, 9:56 PM - +263 71 291 4917: Wooooow we are blessed to be in this  Edoofian family. Thank you so much Sir Austin. Let us open and go through it  as a family overnight and tomorrowduring the whole day to the slotted time. Good night
26/1/24, 7:16 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Good Evening to you all! 
How was your day?
26/1/24, 7:42 PM - +263 71 291 4917: It was super Sir Austin. So hectic hey. Hope yours was well.
26/1/24, 7:46 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: I can understand, my day was blessed!
26/1/24, 7:46 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Did you manage to go through the Offer Letter?
26/1/24, 8:08 PM - +263 77 581 7170: Yes Sir we did and we have a few questions Sir
26/1/24, 8:13 PM - +263 77 581 7170: 1. After paying the initial $1000 as per our conversation with Mr Gupta, according to this offer letter for Anodiwa, we will be still owing 1500usd. When are we required to pay that balance, when Anodiwa is already at the MVN university campus or before she flies  to India?
26/1/24, 8:18 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Please note that the registration fees of $1000 is a part of the cost of education itself which means after the registration fee Payment, you will be left with $1500-$1000=$500
26/1/24, 8:18 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: This reminder is supposed to be paid after the arrival in India
26/1/24, 8:19 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Also, the $250 is a one time payable fee which means from second year, the cost of education would be $1250
26/1/24, 8:19 PM - +263 77 581 7170: 2. The offer letter does not explicitly elaborate  or specify how Anodiwa will survive, issues to do with feeding are not expressed. Is she required to further pay  for food or the food is provided for in the accommodation grant?? If food is catered for in the scholarship, given the differences in staple foods between most African countries and India and given that you have been in this job dealing with many African students is the food easily adoptable
26/1/24, 8:23 PM - +263 77 581 7170: Woooow🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🌟🌟🌟we so enjoying this Sir Austin. Meaning after paying 1000usd, ($500 payable by the 10th of February) and the remainder $500 to be cleared by the 28th of February 2024, we will be left with a balance of  only $500🦻
26/1/24, 8:24 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: 2) Please note that the mentioned cost is inclusive of the food and students will have the option of international cuisine.
26/1/24, 8:24 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Yes please, you heard that right
26/1/24, 8:24 PM - +263 77 581 7170: This is superb news to us Sir Austin. We cannot stop trying harder to raise the initial 1000usd required Sir. And I can see Anodiwa shining in 🇮🇳 India from August 2024
26/1/24, 8:26 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: That's wonderful vision and I am really glad to hear this
26/1/24, 8:26 PM - +263 77 581 7170: International cuisine, meaning if the student is not interested in taking the offered Indian foods she or he can opt to buy elsewhere or u mean the international standard foods are readily available in the Universities???
26/1/24, 8:28 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Indeed, students can opt for international cuisine and international standard food is readily available at our Universities as all of them are international campuses!
26/1/24, 8:28 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Moreover, our Division of Student Welfare will be available at our Universities to assist and resolve any challenges of Edoofians throughout their course
26/1/24, 8:29 PM - +263 77 581 7170: That is good news to Anodiwa. She was now worried that most Indian foods are herbal and usually not tasty for those used to African dishes😅😅
26/1/24, 8:33 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: I understand, Edoofians usually take some time after arrival to adapt with environment and then everything would be fine. Our team will also be guiding Anodiwa
26/1/24, 8:35 PM - +263 77 581 7170: That is great news too Sir Austin. You making it even lighter at least we not going to worry much about food issues..
26/1/24, 8:43 PM - +263 77 581 7170: 3. There is another issue of health matters and university students dressing. As international students, do they wear uniforms. If not, do the universities have given standard dressing codes. This we asking to have a better understanding on Anodiwas dressing issues, particularly sanitary wear
26/1/24, 8:51 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: As you know, India has  reputed healthcare system. Students will have access to clinics and healthcare facilities
26/1/24, 9:03 PM - +263 77 581 7170: 4. OK. Am sure you mean there is a special free healthcare service arrangement for Edoofian students
26/1/24, 9:05 PM - +263 77 581 7170: 5. On the issue of funds payment I'm sure u remember we used Mr Jerera to deposit the 350 +20 for Anodiwa. Now that we now paying for Registration in MSN UNIVERSITY, do we still.use the same method (Mukuru Booth) or we have to pay at a  locally provided bank in Zimbabwe??
26/1/24, 9:58 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Please note that the university will be informing Anodiwa regarding the dress code after arrival. There would be days were formal dressing needs to be followed
26/1/24, 9:59 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Please excuse me for the delay as I had to take a discussion over a call in between.
26/1/24, 10:01 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Indeed, there is healthcare facility provided for Edoofians with free checkups
26/1/24, 10:01 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: That is right, you can either use the same mode of Mukuru Or FBC bank, but let me also suggest a cheaper mode
26/1/24, 10:04 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
26/1/24, 10:05 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
26/1/24, 10:05 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Mr Rajan Nayer.vcf (file attached)
26/1/24, 10:05 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
26/1/24, 10:06 PM - +263 77 581 7170: OK. We wanted to see if her mother can start  saving some money towards Anodiwa's dressing material required.  It would be unhealthy for her to travel all the way carrying bags full of clothes she would never be allowed to wear.  Also, given our financial constrained status as a family visa-ve the wide religious differences between Africa and India, it might be most difficult for her to try and find the required dress code when she would be already in India. How do we cushion this gap Sir
26/1/24, 10:10 PM - +263 77 581 7170: Thank you Sir. That would have been a stitch in time to save nine for us but unfortunately Harare is too far for us. I would suggest we stick to the method we used last time. Via Mukuru. We have an Orange booth around here. All the best and its so accessible for us in Filabusi
26/1/24, 10:16 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Do not worry here, you will soon be provided information about the dress code and uniforms so that you can prepare accordingly. This would most probably be in the next week itself
26/1/24, 10:18 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: This is well noter and would be fine, it is also fine to send to Mr Rajan through Mukuru. You can opt for the convenient mode.
26/1/24, 10:18 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Stay Blessed!
26/1/24, 10:18 PM - +263 77 581 7170: May we kindly retire to bed now its almost midnight Sir.  Tomorrow we won't be available. We lost out grandfather and we will be attending his funeral tomorrow whole day. Good night sir
27/1/24, 2:08 AM - +263 77 581 7170: Thank you Sir
27/1/24, 2:09 AM - +263 77 581 7170: That is wonderful news and thank you for your flexibility Sir. Sleep well too
29/1/24, 9:39 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Good Morning Mr&Mrs Chaurura and Anodiwa!
29/1/24, 9:40 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: I am sorry to hear this and may his soul rest in peace

29/1/24, 11:37 AM - +263 71 291 4917: Thank you. Will surely go through the website and get a more detailed knowledge about the University
29/1/24, 11:38 AM - +263 71 291 4917: Definitely she is a self motivated and  a book monger
29/1/24, 11:40 AM - +263 71 291 4917: If I may ask, how are the hostels for the girls/ladies and how far are they from the learning classes. Are they a walkable distance or Anodiwa will have to daily commute to and fro
29/1/24, 11:52 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: You are welcome!
29/1/24, 11:57 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: That would be great!
29/1/24, 11:57 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: I am happy to hear that
29/1/24, 11:58 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: The hostels are within walking distance itself and is managed by the University. Our Department of Student Welfare will also be ensuring that Edoofians settle well at their hostels and will guide with the required assistance
29/1/24, 12:05 PM - +263 77 581 7170: OK Sir. International academia platforms, particularly those miles away from motherland Africa, have lately been marred by hooliganism, human trafficking and racism. This has derailed many would be benefactors to the more adorable scholarships such as Edoofa. How have you managed to curb such diverse decay usually associated with overseas scholarship programs
29/1/24, 12:10 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: This is a genuine concern, Mrs Chaurura and I have come across them a lot of time during my discussions with families but over these years the concerns have decreased a lot especially while being an Edoofian because we are well known across African Nations now and is focussed on making the lives better for Edoofians.

To give a glimpse, we have a community of more than 2500 Zimbabweans with  300+ associate schools from Zimbabwe with a panel of Headmasters, teachers, and parents, who have been bringing success stories of Edoofians for the past 14+ years due to the kind of foster and care that we provide throughout their course!

With UGC-approved Universities whose degrees are Globally accredited, and which have all security and healthcare facilities including counselling departments, Edoofians are exposed to a conducive environment that motivates them to focus on their career and achieve their dreams. There are Zimbabwean Communities at Every University so no child will feel lonely. Moreover, our Admission Team, DSW, EWYL(Earn While You Learn) mentor and counsellor of a student will be available to him/her throughout the course. At any point, if the student or parent needs assistance we will be readily accessible. This is the reason why Edoofa is known as a *Higher Education Concierge!*
29/1/24, 12:11 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Moreover, we visit African Nations every year to prepare our Edoofians for the journey to the next level, We are coming next month

29/1/24, 12:15 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: So, your children are a part of one of the most popular and recognized scholarship in the African Continent
29/1/24, 12:19 PM - +263 77 581 7170: This is so wonderful👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻.you clearly elaborated and enlighted every dark corner. I had to get clarification from you so that I do not run short of words since most potential clients raise such grave concerns for their children. Some even insult me saying  probably I'm planning to sacrifice their kids for money🤣🤣🤣at least you gave me the genuine weaponry to win more clients for Edoofa. Safety concerns are a top priority for all parents and they do not take any second fiddle responses lightly. If you fail to give a detailed explanation to them at the initial stages of marketing the Edoofa programs you stand to lose out. Am so delighted you highlighted everything above board
29/1/24, 12:21 PM - +263 77 581 7170: I like the sound of this🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟💫
29/1/24, 12:23 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Absolutely, Mrs Chaurura!
Safety is the top priority which is the reason we have  deployed our Department of Student Welfare team who will be working directly at our Universities and attending Edoofians, providing them assistance and support!
29/1/24, 12:24 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: It is true that every parent needs absolute clarity and assurance as this is a big step for their child's career. The concerns are genuine and we ensure to discuss it openly and show them the exposures to gain full confidence.
29/1/24, 12:25 PM - +263 71 291 4917: Am delighted to hear that Sir Austin. I pray that they both get Best Student awards in all their subject areas and score outstandingly on everything they learn from the University.
29/1/24, 12:29 PM - +263 71 291 4917: If u are still available for this question and answer session Sir Austin. May I ask.something else. Anodiwa will definitely be there in India 1st week of Augist 2024. Anodiwa's twin sister also wanted to come to India this year to persue her Law studies. Is it possible, given that they are twin sisters and would not do staying away from.each other for a long time and also during to the fact that Anesu said she cannot stay away from books for a year doing almost nothing academic related
29/1/24, 12:31 PM - +263 71 291 4917: In short, after flying rhe first batch of students to India in the first week of August 2024, is there any other batch of Edoofians whom you will facilitate to fly to India this year, or else that will be the end this very year so Anesu will have to wait for 2025???
29/1/24, 12:35 PM - +263 71 291 4917: My twin girls' request was that they wanted to fly together this August 2024. Please note well that we would have managed to pay for Anodiwa only. Is it possible.
29/1/24, 12:52 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Good to hear from you, Mr Chaurura!
Please do not worry, we will be initiating Anesu's process soon and at the same time you can initiate the preparations for both of them as informed by our Program Director. We have made special recommendations for Anesu as well
29/1/24, 12:55 PM - +263 77 581 7170: Thank you Sir Austin. It is my prayer as their parent to have them go at once. That will facilitate their staying together even if it may not mean in one hostel, but knowing that both of them are in India, at one University Campus, MVN. This will also give us as their parents the joy that we really need to hear from both of them from abroad. Thank you for making this dream of theirs come true. Let us work head to toe to secure Anodiwa's much needed fees of 1000usd soonest
29/1/24, 1:05 PM - +263 71 291 4917: Fantastic Sir Austin. We discussed this overnight with their mother and the duo. We agreed to get clarity on the matter, though it was hinted and promised by the Programs Director Sir  Abhinav Gupta, we needed to be spot-on to this point. Thank you once again.

However, we have been communicating alright through the whole of this week and you did not communicate this to us madam. FBC bank is about 120km away.  We need to commute (extra 10-20usd needed) Mukuru is about 10km walking distance (5km to and 5km back). At least had you communicated maybe we could have not deposited the money there. Also given that we made all.our payments via Mukuru, it was so so so convenient for us. Banks are too far and out of reach for us Ma'am. Can you help by accepting this as your last transaction via this Mode ma'am 🙏🏼🙏🏼
