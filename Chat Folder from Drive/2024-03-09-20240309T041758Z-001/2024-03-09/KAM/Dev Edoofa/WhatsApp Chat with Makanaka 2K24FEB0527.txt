5/3/24, 10:02 AM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you so much for giving a detailed introduction of yourself and your family. It is commendable to see that you and your husband have been providing unwavering support to your children's education. I must appreciate your transparency in providing the introduction.
5/3/24, 10:04 AM - +263 78 271 4456: Thank you
5/3/24, 10:05 AM - Dev Edoofa: Since this is your admissions group, I believe you must have added your husband and Makanaka to the group. This will help them become familiar with the admission process and enable them to participate when required. Could you please confirm if they have already been added to the group?
5/3/24, 10:08 AM - +263 78 271 4456: Ok my husband is not on Ap we both use this number and Makanaka is at school right  now when on holiday she uses this number again
5/3/24, 10:09 AM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. I understand. Now moving forward, let me brief you that your admissions process and your EWYL program will operate concurrently in the future, therefore you will have two Whatsapp groups to connect with the team: <This message was edited>
5/3/24, 10:10 AM - Dev Edoofa: 1. The admissions group *(Makanaka 2K24FEB0527)*  will be the platform where we, as your admission officers, will be communicating with you. This group is dedicated to all-important discussions like your university admission process, offer letter discussion, and ultimately your university registration and reservation of your scholarship along with the Visa process. This group will continue to assist you with your admission-related queries while you are here in India.
5/3/24, 10:10 AM - Dev Edoofa: 2. Earn While You Learn Program *(Makanaka EWYL23E1348)* . In this group, your EWYL mentor, head of the department, and head coach will be present. With this group, we will make sure you are prepared to self-finance your education here in India. With your dedicated efforts in the EWYL program, you will earn maximum scholarship credits.

This group will keep a record of the tasks and projects you undertake. You will be provided with the link to the group after the completion of the admission process session and on the dedicated date for your EWYL session, where you will be able to directly speak to your EWYL mentor. I hope you are clear about the purpose of the two groups.
5/3/24, 10:12 AM - +263 78 271 4456: It's very  clear thank you
5/3/24, 10:12 AM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. Moving forward in today's session, we will discuss a bit about your university admission journey. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts. I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them.

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
5/3/24, 10:13 AM - +263 78 271 4456: Please go on
5/3/24, 10:13 AM - Dev Edoofa: <Media omitted>
5/3/24, 10:15 AM - +263 78 271 4456: Am done please go on
5/3/24, 10:15 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
5/3/24, 10:15 AM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
5/3/24, 10:22 AM - +263 78 271 4456: Ok thank you
5/3/24, 10:22 AM - Dev Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps - 

*Step 3: Introduction to the Financial Secure Plan* - Parents with children embarking on their university journey within the next one to two years face important decision-making and rigorous financial planning. Edoofa recognizes the significance of this transition and hence has introduced the Edoofa Secure Plan - a unique and systematic strategy to empower parents in financial planning and preparing for their child's tertiary education well in advance.
5/3/24, 10:22 AM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Scholarship Offer Letter from the university would be issued next year in the month of August.

I hope you are following?
5/3/24, 10:24 AM - +263 78 271 4456: I am following  shall I share my questions as we go or there shall come a time for questions
5/3/24, 10:29 AM - Dev Edoofa: All of your questions regarding the steps will be cleared when we reach that step, as clearing the doubts right now, will make it more confusing for you to understand the processes in a better way. I hope you understand? <This message was edited>
5/3/24, 10:31 AM - +263 78 271 4456: Ok
5/3/24, 10:31 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. The registration fee will be paid through the savings you have accumulated visa the Financial Secure Plan. After the registration fee is paid, for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
5/3/24, 10:31 AM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
5/3/24, 10:33 AM - +263 78 271 4456: Yes
5/3/24, 10:34 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through all 6 steps if we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
5/3/24, 10:34 AM - +263 78 271 4456: Sure
5/3/24, 10:36 AM - Dev Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
5/3/24, 10:36 AM - Dev Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding. Until you are ready, shall we start with our discussion with me individually? 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
5/3/24, 10:55 AM - +263 78 271 4456: Sure let's move forward
5/3/24, 10:55 AM - Dev Edoofa: *Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students*

This is a video by the founders of EDOOFA, in which they share 2 important qualities of successful Edoofians- who've secured a maximum scholarship and earned scholarship credits.

https://youtu.be/SIh6DcQsqYM
5/3/24, 10:55 AM - Dev Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s vision for you*

This is another video of the founders, where they share the vision of Edoofa at a core level. Founders also talk more about the most important character trait that distinguishes a successful student from the rest of the crowd.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q44qkd4wc7o
5/3/24, 10:56 AM - Dev Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

The third video is about Schools, Colleges, and Universities. I'm sure you're excited to learn more about the schools, colleges, and universities on the Edoofa Platform. Founders talk about their decade-long journey of discovering these schools and the experiences that students are having in these schools.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DW82emflFHw&feature=youtu.be
5/3/24, 10:56 AM - Dev Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP*

The fourth video is about the Statement of Purpose (SOP). The most important step towards securing a good scholarship is to write the Statement of Purpose but to know why it is important, watching this video will clear your doubts and questions.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftsGGGBYMrs&feature=youtu.be
5/3/24, 10:56 AM - Dev Edoofa: I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection.
5/3/24, 10:57 AM - Dev Edoofa: Please go through the 4 videos, and let us know whenever you are done watching the videos. We will move forward with our conversation.
5/3/24, 11:17 AM - +263 78 271 4456: <Media omitted>
5/3/24, 11:19 AM - Dev Edoofa: I understand you may take your time till you have a strong network connection.
5/3/24, 11:19 AM - +263 78 271 4456: Thank you
5/3/24, 11:19 AM - Dev Edoofa: You are most welcome!
6/3/24, 7:43 AM - +263 78 271 4456: Good morning  am traveling  to the next town so that I get access to strong  internet   yesterday  it did  not work out am sorry
6/3/24, 8:36 AM - Dev Edoofa: Good Morning Mrs. Zimba!
I hope you are doing well. I completely understand the network challenges that you are facing. Let me know whenever you are done watching the videos, so that we can move ahead with our process.
6/3/24, 8:37 AM - Dev Edoofa: This message was deleted
6/3/24, 12:40 PM - Dev Edoofa: Hello Mrs. Zimba!
May I know if you were able to watch the videos that were shared with you?
6/3/24, 2:15 PM - +263 78 271 4456: Good afternoon  yes I did  though  some of them were having a noisy background but I managed gather  some of what was being said
6/3/24, 2:16 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that! May I know your understanding of the 4 videos?
6/3/24, 2:30 PM - +263 78 271 4456: Ok thank you  from what I managed to gather the founders of Edoofa were saying that  SOP is most important  in that it shows and help people to secure a place at any University it convince  people  so that they see a good reason  to enroll a student they also talked about the issue  of universities that one is left with no doubts  since they engage good  universities they also said that at the end of school one would see the importance of this scholarship  since one would be able to do things on his or her own since skills are being  acquired  one would  be employable and  would  be able to apply skills lastly what I heard they talked about a form in the last video which was said it needed to be filled  without delay but I did not manage to see the form in short this is  what I manged to gather
6/3/24, 2:32 PM - Dev Edoofa: Brilliant. I must tell you that you were able to completely feel the essence of the videos and properly grasp the information that was conveyed in those videos.
6/3/24, 2:32 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose. I hope you were able to follow through with this?
6/3/24, 2:33 PM - +263 78 271 4456: Let's move on
6/3/24, 2:35 PM - Dev Edoofa: Glad to hear that. Now, it is our responsibility to move Makanaka's application ahead and help Makanaka write a proper statement of purpose so that he/she can get into the best University that provides quality education that leads to a Job. So, for the team to work on Makanaka's  application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, we would require Makanka's availability for approximately 30 minutes. If she is unavailable, she can provide you with her input, and you can proceed with the statement of purpose on her behalf. <This message was edited>
6/3/24, 2:36 PM - Dev Edoofa: 1. I am sure you have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in Makanaka's admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

https://goo.gl/forms/iWss6zPuOFbnGTXK2
6/3/24, 2:36 PM - Dev Edoofa: 2. I am sharing two documents with you. Kindly go through both documents and submit Makanaka’s responses to the course document here in the group. Make sure to share her inputs and that she has researched well before starting the task. All the best!

6/3/24, 2:37 PM - Dev Edoofa: I hope you are clear with the tasks?
