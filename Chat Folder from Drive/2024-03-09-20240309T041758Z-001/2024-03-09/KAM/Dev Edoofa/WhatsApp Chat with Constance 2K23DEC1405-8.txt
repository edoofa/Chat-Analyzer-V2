27/12/23, 4:28 PM - Dev Edoofa: Amazing, Moving forward in our today’s session, we will discuss a bit about Constance's university admission journey. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts, I will explain to you it in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them.

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
27/12/23, 4:30 PM - +263 78 403 8287: Yes
27/12/23, 4:30 PM - Dev Edoofa: <Media omitted>
27/12/23, 4:32 PM - +263 77 679 3336: Noted
27/12/23, 4:33 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
27/12/23, 4:33 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
27/12/23, 4:35 PM - +263 78 403 8287: Yes they are
27/12/23, 4:37 PM - Dev Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
27/12/23, 4:37 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
27/12/23, 4:38 PM - +263 78 403 8287: It's clear
27/12/23, 4:38 PM - +263 77 679 3336: Yes
27/12/23, 4:38 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
27/12/23, 4:39 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
27/12/23, 4:41 PM - +263 78 403 8287: Yes, understood
27/12/23, 4:41 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through all 6 steps, please feel free to share your thoughts and queries if you have any.
27/12/23, 4:48 PM - +263 77 679 3336: It's all clear
27/12/23, 4:48 PM - +263 77 679 3336: No queries
27/12/23, 4:50 PM - +263 78 403 8287: It's all clear and we have noted everything
27/12/23, 4:59 PM - Dev Edoofa: Alright please, I would encourage you to go through the above image representing your university admission process and once you are done, let me know so that I can explain the same to you in detail.
27/12/23, 5:02 PM - +263 78 403 8287: We have done this already
27/12/23, 5:08 PM - Dev Edoofa: Thanks for letting me know Constance. Due to some technical glitch, I think the same message was repeated twice
27/12/23, 5:08 PM - Dev Edoofa: If we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
27/12/23, 5:12 PM - +263 78 403 8287: Yes
27/12/23, 5:16 PM - Dev Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life.

27/12/23, 5:16 PM - +263 77 679 3336: Ok
27/12/23, 5:16 PM - Dev Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding.

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention.
27/12/23, 5:17 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students*

27/12/23, 5:17 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP*

The fourth video is about the Statement of Purpose (SOP). The most important step towards securing a good scholarship is to write the Statement of Purpose but to know why it is important, watching this video will clear your doubts and questions.

27/12/23, 5:17 PM - Dev Edoofa: Please go through the 4 videos, our next session will be scheduled after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarize your understanding. Hence I would like to know by when do you think you will be able to go through these videos so that we can schedule our next session accordingly?

Random Access Memory is used to perform necessary tasks while the computer is on.It is a short term memory and it is volatile.RAM can be modified ,erased and read.Types of data stored in Ram are operating system,parts of application software in use, instructions awaiting processing, immediate results of processing awaiting output,data awaiting to be written to storage media.RAM has three types which are static Ram (SRAM) , Dynamic Ram (DRAM), Synchronous Dynamic Ram (SDRAM).
ROM-is non-volatile and it permanently stores instructions for a computer.Data in ROM cannot be edited or deleted.ROM stores instructions that tell the computer how to perform basic functions such as initializing hardware components and loading the operating system (these instructions are referred to as firmware because they remain unchanged after the computer has been programed.
Secondary memory is also known as backup memory.Examples are Hard disk drives,Solid state drives, Optical drives,USB flash drives, floppy disks

It is a model of communication designed by ISO (International Standards Organization). It allows computers from different manufacturers or origin  to be connected together.The idea is that suppliers must produce hardware or software to implement any of the seven layers while other suppliers provide those of other layers promoting standardization.The seven layers are - Application,Presentation,Session,Transport, Network,Data link, Physical.
Application layer - defines how user application interface or access communication services, initiates or accepts a request, provide a network applications like data transfer, messaging and operating system functions.
Presentation layer-deals with how information is presented for example ASCII,adds formatting or data transformation (for instance from ASCII to Unicode),data compression and data encryption.
Session layer-creates and terminates sessions for example login session,file transfer session, adds traffic flow control information.The session layer is also responsible for deciding on the communication method.
Transport layer-allows error correction during transmission,maintains flow control,allows data recovery, and allows routing, addressing and multiplexing of signals.It implements communication methods - implements the functions necessary to send data to the communication partner.These mechanisms include multiplexing data from different applications establishing data integrity,and management of virtual circuits.
Networ layer-adds sequencing and address information,sets logical protocols, creating frames(consisting of address fields,control field,date and error control field).
Data Link Layer-provide error-checking and formats data for physical transmission,defined network type and packet sequencing,used for synchronization.
Physical layer-it is responsible for sending data and receiving data across a physical medium.The data is sent in bits , either 0 or 1.
3/1/24, 8:57 AM - +263 77 679 3336: 4)Operator overloading is a feature of object-oriented programming languages that allows operators to behave differently depending on the type of data they are operating on. In C++, Java, and Python, operator overloading allows developers to create their own custom operators. This can make code more readable and expressive. In C++, for example, operator overloading can be used to create custom operators for classes, such as adding two points in a coordinate system.ln Java, operator overloading is used to create custom operators for classes and interfaces. For example, the addition operator can be overloaded to add two BigInteger objects, which are used to represent very large integers. In Python, operator overloading is used to create custom operators for user-defined classes. For example, the addition operator can be overloaded to add two instances of a class that represents a date.In C++, operator overloading can also be used to create custom assignment operators. For example, the assignment operator can be overloaded to assign values to custom data structures. In Java, the assignment operator can be overloaded to assign values to user-defined objects. In Python, operator overloading can be used to create custom comparison operators. For example, the "less than" operator can be overloaded to compare two instances of a custom class.

For example, advancements in robotics and automation can help businesses produce goods and services more efficiently. This can lead to increased profits and economic growth. Additionally, technology can create new markets and job opportunities. The development of the internet, for example, has led to the growth of the e-commerce industry.

I hope you are doing well, and that this message finds you in the best of spirits. Please excuse me for not being able to connect with you in the past couple of days, I was a bit under the weather and had to take some time off to focus on my health.

During this period, I couldn't communicate about my unavailability. However, I am feeling much better today and am available to resume all operations.

Additionally, since it has been a while since we last connected, I was wondering how you and your family are doing?

26/1/24, 10:33 AM - Dev Edoofa: Good Morning Mr. and Mrs. Dhliwayo and Constance!
I hope you are doing well and had a wonderful start to the day. May I know why were you late for our session on Wednesday? If you are facing any challenges, please let us know about it. It will help us align ourselves accordingly.
26/1/24, 12:13 PM - +263 78 403 8287: Hie
26/1/24, 12:14 PM - +263 78 403 8287: I was travelling and network was erratic

26/1/24, 12:48 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that! Regarding the discussion we had the other day about the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan, I wanted to follow up on our last conversation. Have you, as a family, been able to discuss it? If so, I would like to understand how the discussion went. What were their thoughts about it? Did they have any specific queries or concerns that you would like us to address?
26/1/24, 12:57 PM - +263 78 403 8287: No problem yet
26/1/24, 12:58 PM - +263 78 403 8287: We are eager to be in the program
26/1/24, 1:00 PM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know, Mr. Dhliwayo. For the current round of students, there are only 27 seats available for the students who can benefit from the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan. 

Since Constance has been one of the most dedicated students, and I see she has great aspirations, I wanted her to be a part of the same set of students and start with your future planning the right way.
26/1/24, 1:00 PM - Dev Edoofa: Also, as this plan commences from the month of January, for the efficient implementation of this plan, we need to decide on a fixed date on which you will deposit $150 every month. This will provide you with the flexibility to align your finances accordingly.
26/1/24, 1:00 PM - Dev Edoofa: Our complete focus is on providing students and parents with the best ways to avail themselves of these opportunities. We understand that every parent may not be able to make the payment on our specified date. Therefore, considering this situation, we allow them to decide the payment date according to their comfort. In light of the same, may I know the fixed date every month on which you will deposit $150?
26/1/24, 1:02 PM - +263 78 403 8287: Now that January is gone, can that start in february
26/1/24, 1:03 PM - +263 78 403 8287: With the 26th of each month as the fixed date
26/1/24, 1:03 PM - Dev Edoofa: Surely, you can start from February as well.
26/1/24, 1:03 PM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for sharing these details, your commitment to securing a seat in this exclusive program is appreciated.


To proceed with the next steps, we will be sharing an official agreement detailing the specifics of the Financial Secure Plan along with its benefits. This agreement is a crucial document that outlines the terms and conditions of your participation in the program. It serves as a legal framework ensuring transparency and mutual understanding between all parties involved.
26/1/24, 1:03 PM - Dev Edoofa: As we prepare to send you the agreement, we kindly request the following details to personalize the document:

1. Full Name of Parent/Guardian/Sponsor responsible for catering to the student's finances [The representative in whose name you want the agreement to be]


2. Residential Address of the aforementioned representative.
26/1/24, 1:03 PM - Dev Edoofa: Providing accurate and up-to-date information is essential to ensure the seamless processing of your enrollment in the Financial Secure Plan. Once we receive these details, we will quickly ask the team to share the agreement with you for your review and signature.
26/1/24, 1:04 PM - +263 78 403 8287: I want to know the total amount required
26/1/24, 1:08 PM - +263 78 403 8287: Ezekiel Dhliwayo Parent

26/1/24, 1:22 PM - Dev Edoofa: So Mr. Dhliwayo, as per the discussion in our previous sessions, you will have to pay $150 for the next 10 months, so that you are able to save $1500 at the end of 10 months. This saved amount and plan for further months will be used to cover for your registration fee to the universities, the first-semester fee as well and some other aspects as well. For better clarity, you can go through our conversation in this group from the previous sessions.
26/1/24, 1:23 PM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for providing the required details for the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan. Your response is greatly appreciated, and we are pleased to inform you that we have duly noted the information you shared.

As for the examinations, we will provide her with ample time to prepare for her examinations and ensure that her studies are not affected. So, no need to worry, Mr. Dhliwayo.
