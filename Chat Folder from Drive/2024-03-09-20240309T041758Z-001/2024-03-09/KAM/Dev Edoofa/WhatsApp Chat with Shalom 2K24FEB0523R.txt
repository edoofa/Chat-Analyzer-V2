This group is dedicated to all-important discussions like your university admission process, offer letter discussion, and ultimately your university registration and reservation of your scholarship along with the Visa process. This group will continue to assist you with your admission-related queries while you are here in India.
4/3/24, 9:34 AM - +263 77 245 6229: Noted

This group will keep a record of the tasks and projects you undertake. You will be provided with the link to the group after the completion of the admission process session and on the dedicated date for your EWYL session, where you will be able to directly speak to your EWYL mentor. I hope you are clear about the purpose of the two groups.
4/3/24, 9:37 AM - +263 77 245 6229: Well understood
4/3/24, 9:39 AM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. Moving forward in today's session, we will discuss a bit about your university admission journey. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts. I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them.

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
4/3/24, 9:41 AM - +263 77 245 6229: Let's start.  I am  following
4/3/24, 9:43 AM - +263 71 724 6985: Let's start
4/3/24, 9:47 AM - Dev Edoofa: <Media omitted>
4/3/24, 9:49 AM - +263 77 245 6229: Am done
4/3/24, 9:49 AM - +263 71 724 6985: Me too
4/3/24, 9:49 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
4/3/24, 9:49 AM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
4/3/24, 9:53 AM - +263 71 724 6985: Who comes up with this statement of purpose. Is it Edoofa or Shalom
4/3/24, 9:56 AM - +263 77 245 6229: Shalom  i think
4/3/24, 9:56 AM - Dev Edoofa: We will need Shalom's inputs for preparing Shalom's Statement of Purpose.
4/3/24, 9:57 AM - +263 77 245 6229: Understood
4/3/24, 9:58 AM - Dev Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps - 

*Step 3: Introduction to the Financial Secure Plan* - Parents with children embarking on their university journey within the next one to two years face important decision-making and rigorous financial planning. Edoofa recognizes the significance of this transition and hence has introduced the Edoofa Secure Plan - a unique and systematic strategy to empower parents in financial planning and preparing for their child's tertiary education well in advance.
4/3/24, 9:58 AM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Scholarship Offer Letter from the university would be issued next year in the month of August.

I hope you are following?
4/3/24, 10:00 AM - +263 77 245 6229: Ww are following
4/3/24, 10:03 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. The registration fee will be paid through the savings you have accumulated visa the Financial Secure Plan. After the registration fee is paid, for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
4/3/24, 10:03 AM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
4/3/24, 10:05 AM - +263 77 245 6229: Very clear
4/3/24, 10:05 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through all 6 steps, if we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
4/3/24, 10:07 AM - +263 77 245 6229: Proceed
4/3/24, 10:08 AM - Dev Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
4/3/24, 10:08 AM - Dev Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding. Until you are ready, shall we start with our discussion with me individually? 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
4/3/24, 10:11 AM - +263 77 245 6229: Share
4/3/24, 10:12 AM - Dev Edoofa: *Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students*

This is a video by the founders of EDOOFA, in which they share 2 important qualities of successful Edoofians- who've secured a maximum scholarship and earned scholarship credits.

Founders talk about their decade-long journey of discovering these schools and the experiences that students are having in these schools.

5/3/24, 10:39 AM - +263 77 245 6229: Shalom  is still  at school.  Her sister is joining you now.  I am  a bit occupied  with  work  at the  moment.  Might  need  some 30 minutes
5/3/24, 10:41 AM - Dev Edoofa: I understand you may take your time to share your understanding of the videos. Till then we can move ahead to the next step in the admission cycle. What do you think about it?
5/3/24, 10:42 AM - +263 77 245 6229: It's alright
5/3/24, 10:42 AM - Dev Edoofa: Glad to hear that. Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.
5/3/24, 10:43 AM - Dev Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move Shalom's application ahead and help Shalom write a proper statement of purpose so that he/she can get into the best University that provides quality education that leads to a Job. So, for the team to work on Shalom's application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, we would require Shalom's availability for approximately 30 minutes. If she is unavailable, she can provide you with her input, and you can proceed with the statement of purpose on her behalf.
5/3/24, 10:44 AM - Dev Edoofa: 1. I am sure you have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in Shalom's admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

5/3/24, 10:45 AM - +263 71 724 6985: Good morning

5/3/24, 10:46 AM - Dev Edoofa: <Media omitted>

5/3/24, 10:46 AM - Dev Edoofa: Good Morning Mrs. Sithole.
5/3/24, 10:47 AM - Dev Edoofa: Once you share these documents and complete the two tasks that have been provided to you, we will have completed the second step of your university admission process. At that point, we will be prepared to move on to the third step, which involves Introduction to the Financial Secure Plan. Hence, could you kindly confirm when you will be able to complete these tasks and reconnect with us? This will allow us to schedule our discussion accordingly.
5/3/24, 10:53 AM - +263 71 724 6985: Shalom will send the answers at 1pm. Right now she is at school and we are waiting for her to add her input. We will be free at that time

6/3/24, 8:27 AM - Dev Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Shalom!
I hope you are doing well. Thank you for sharing the answers to the questions on the document and the screenshot of the filled Statement of Purpose. I have taken complete note of it and updated our records as well. I must let you know that your and Shalom's proactiveness towards admission processes must be commended and is truly appreciated.
6/3/24, 8:30 AM - +263 77 245 6229: Thank you
6/3/24, 8:34 AM - Dev Edoofa: You are most welcome! May I know if you are ready to take forward our session for today, right now?
6/3/24, 8:37 AM - +263 77 245 6229: Not yet ready. Let me consult others.  I might  need 2 hours . Shalom Will be back from school after midday.
6/3/24, 8:38 AM - Dev Edoofa: I understand, Mr. Sithole. Just let me know whenever you are available to take forward our conversation.
6/3/24, 8:42 AM - +263 77 245 6229: Thank
6/3/24, 8:52 AM - +263 71 724 6985: Good morning. I think we can have our next session at 12.45 when Shalom is back from school. If there is no need for her we can have the discussion at around 10.30am
6/3/24, 8:53 AM - Dev Edoofa: We can go ahead with the session at 10:30 AM.
6/3/24, 8:59 AM - +263 71 724 6985: Noted
6/3/24, 9:01 AM - Dev Edoofa: It is good to know that!
6/3/24, 10:27 AM - Dev Edoofa: Hello Mr. and Mrs. Sithole!
May I know if you are ready to take forward our conversation?
6/3/24, 10:27 AM - +263 77 245 6229: Yes
6/3/24, 10:28 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that!
6/3/24, 10:29 AM - Dev Edoofa: With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey, i.e. *Introduction to Financial Secure Plan*.
6/3/24, 10:29 AM - Dev Edoofa: However, before we start the same, I was going through your scholarship application file and noticed that you are supposed to make the payment of the remaining part of the Edoofa Enrollment fee. Hence, I thought of sharing a gentle reminder with you and trying to understand how your preparation has been so far? Have you been able to align your preparations in the right direction?
6/3/24, 10:33 AM - +263 77 245 6229: Yea.  We are paying  the balance by Friday
6/3/24, 10:34 AM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for letting us know. We will update the accounts team as well.
6/3/24, 10:35 AM - Dev Edoofa: In the meantime, Let us move forward with our discussion. To confirm our records: the course Shalom has selected for her higher education is BA LLB and it's my understanding that she is planning to arrive in India in August 2025. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate? <This message was edited>
6/3/24, 10:37 AM - +263 71 724 6985: Yes it is accurate
6/3/24, 10:38 AM - +263 77 245 6229: Correct
6/3/24, 10:38 AM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. Based on our experience of over 14 years and having assisted over 5000 students from different countries, we have realized that financial planning is the most important factor when a student plans for their higher education abroad.
6/3/24, 10:38 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am sure that you must be aware that 20-30% of students who are admitted into universities abroad are unable to fulfill their dream and come to India due to a lack of financial planning. The funds needed for booking flights, accommodation, and covering living expenses after arrival often become overwhelming, leading to the decision to defer their admission for a year. This, in turn, creates a gap in the child's education.
6/3/24, 10:38 AM - Dev Edoofa: To assist both students and parents in this regard, Edoofa Management has designed a Financial Secure Plan that aims to help you prepare for your higher educational finances without experiencing stress or last-minute rushes. I believe you must be wondering about the details of the same plan and how it helps the parents?
6/3/24, 10:40 AM - +263 71 724 6985: Yes, how does it work or help
6/3/24, 10:43 AM - Dev Edoofa: Sure. Let me help you understand it. Edoofa Secure Plan is important for parents who have children joining the university for tertiary education in the next one to two years for several reasons:
6/3/24, 10:43 AM - Dev Edoofa: 1. *Financial Preparedness:* The Edoofa Secure plan helps parents prepare financially for the costs after the Scholarship being offered so that they are not caught off guard.

2. *Reduced Financial Stress:* Having the Edoofa Secure Plan in place can significantly reduce the financial stress on you as parents when your child is about to enter university. Knowing that there is a dedicated fund for education expenses provides peace of mind.
6/3/24, 10:43 AM - Dev Edoofa: 3. *Avoiding Debt*: Without proper savings, some parents may resort to taking out loans or accumulating credit card debt to cover their child's education costs. This Educational savings plan helps avoid the burden of debt and high-interest payments.

4. *Compound Interest:* By starting to save early and consistently contributing to the savings plan, parents can take advantage of compound interest, which can significantly increase the amount available for education expenses.
6/3/24, 10:43 AM - Dev Edoofa: 5. *Flexibility and Control:* The Edoofa Secure savings plans allow parents to have greater control over their finances and how they allocate funds for their child's education. They can choose investment options that align with their risk tolerance and financial goals.

6. *Encouraging Responsibility*: Involving your child in the process of saving for their education teaches them financial responsibility and the value of higher education. It also motivates them to outperform in Academics.
6/3/24, 10:43 AM - Dev Edoofa: 7. *Adapting to Unexpected Changes*: Life is full of surprises, and circumstances can change especially when there are political reforms changing each day impacting the Local Currency. Having an Edoofa Secure Plan allows parents to adapt to unexpected changes in their financial situation while still prioritizing their child's education.

8. *Peace of Mind:* Overall, having the Edoofa Secure plan provides parents with peace of mind, knowing that they are actively planning for their child's future and increasing the likelihood of providing them with a solid education.
6/3/24, 10:43 AM - Dev Edoofa: Now, when you go through all the above benefits, I am sure you can see that the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan is an important financial tool for parents/students who are supposed to enter the university soon. 

It helps ensure that the financial aspect of tertiary education is well-managed, reduces stress, and allows parents to provide the best opportunities for their children without resorting to debt or financial hardship. Isn't this something you and your family also wish to have?
6/3/24, 10:48 AM - +263 71 724 6985: How do we go about the process? 
On benefit number 7 you mentioned Edoofa secure savings plans. What plans are available
6/3/24, 10:50 AM - Dev Edoofa: Sure, let me help you explain each and every aspect of the plan, for which I will be needing your unwavering attention.
6/3/24, 10:50 AM - Dev Edoofa: As you are aware, we are currently in March 2024, and we have a good 20 months to plan for your finances before you start your university education in 2025.
6/3/24, 10:50 AM - Dev Edoofa: During the counseling session, you were informed that at Edoofa, we guarantee a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship on the tuition fees. Hence, the cost of education, including food and accommodation after the scholarship, would be between $2000-$3000, and it could be even less. Not more than that.
6/3/24, 10:50 AM - Dev Edoofa: This means that if you can save $150 per month for the next 20 months, you will be able to save $3000. This amount is more than enough for the first year of university fees, including tuition fees (if any), food, and accommodation. I hope you agree with this?
6/3/24, 10:54 AM - +263 71 724 6985: Is it the only option available
6/3/24, 10:58 AM - Dev Edoofa: You can opt for the normal ways of registration as well but let me first explain this plan, as this plan helps the parents to prepare for the finances accordingly so that they are not burdened with the hefty amount to be paid at once. There are many benefits of this plan, which are not offered with the normal plan. So, I would recommend you to first understand this plan, and decide what is the best option for Shalom's education.
6/3/24, 11:00 AM - +263 71 724 6985: Go on
6/3/24, 11:00 AM - +263 77 245 6229: Am following
6/3/24, 11:02 AM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you, please. Now, if we follow the above procedure, this means that by the time Shalom is in India, she will have already saved the $3000 that will cover the first-year fee.
6/3/24, 11:03 AM - Dev Edoofa: Now, in these next 20 months, I am sure Shalom would also be engaged in the EWYL program, and if she secures a minimum of $1000 in 20 months, that means the fees for 1.5 years are already secured.
6/3/24, 11:03 AM - Dev Edoofa: Now, for a 3-year course, if we follow the same approach for the remaining 1.5 years, the educational journey for the student and the financial journey for the parent will be easy and smooth. I believe you must be able to see this perspective?
6/3/24, 11:07 AM - +263 71 724 6985: I understand
6/3/24, 11:08 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. With that said, there is also another benefit, I am sure being in Zimbabwe you know how drastically the exchange rate fluctuates.
6/3/24, 11:08 AM - Dev Edoofa: If you are buying a dollar today, you might be spending 7000 bonds, but if you buy a dollar after a month, the rate would be different.
6/3/24, 11:08 AM - Dev Edoofa: Also, even if you choose to buy dollars every month and save at your home, it is not safe since there is news of robbery, and mugging every day.
6/3/24, 11:08 AM - Dev Edoofa: In that case, you will opt to save in the Bank, but again we know that savings in the Bank require a Nostro Account which means you have to pay the bank to keep your money safe, right?
6/3/24, 11:09 AM - +263 71 724 6985: That's right
6/3/24, 11:11 AM - Dev Edoofa: That is great to hear. Considering these constraints, Edoofa Management has decided to help the parents and students prepare for the journey way ahead of time by helping them save money with Edoofa without any additional charges but rather saving additional money as well. Do you want me to explain how this has been achieved?
6/3/24, 11:13 AM - +263 71 724 6985: Yes, explain
6/3/24, 11:14 AM - +263 77 245 6229: Explain
6/3/24, 11:15 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Program Fee (Enrollment Fee) that you were asked to pay is $350. From the $350, you have already paid $200, and the remaining $150 is what you are planning to pay before your due date of *13-March-2024*.
6/3/24, 11:15 AM - Dev Edoofa: Under the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan, a parent has to deposit a small amount of money which is $150 every month for the next 10 months. 

That means, in 10 months, the money saved will be $1500. When this money is saved, Edoofa will waive off the remaining $150 which was due from the Edoofa Program/Enrollment Fee of $350, thereby making a straight saving of $150 in 10 months.
6/3/24, 11:15 AM - Dev Edoofa: Imagine you paying $15 every month to the Bank of Zimbabwe to keep your money safe, and here Edoofa is paying you $15 every month to keep your money safe. Now, you must be wondering, why only for 10 months and not for 20 months, right?
6/3/24, 11:18 AM - +263 71 724 6985: Yes
6/3/24, 11:19 AM - Dev Edoofa: If you see the bigger picture, you will realize that the reason is quite simple. Upon the completion of the 10 installments, the Edoofa Admissions team will initiate the Child’s Admission Process by applying early to the universities to secure their scholarship and their university seat.
6/3/24, 11:19 AM - Dev Edoofa: Reserving seats earlier increases the chances of obtaining a maximum scholarship. A higher scholarship means lower fees, and by securing the seat, you will be entitled to pay the fees as per the old fee structure of the university, not the new one implemented in January 2025. Furthermore, when applying to the universities, you will receive an offer letter or a letter of intent detailing the fees, scholarship, and registration fees.
6/3/24, 11:19 AM - Dev Edoofa: As explained during the enrollment process, the registration fee is a portion of your first-year university fee, paid to reserve the seat. It ranges from $500-$1000 and is not an additional fee. 

From the $1500 you saved with Edoofa, the registration fee will be paid to the university, securing the seat. For instance, if the registration fee is $1000, Edoofa will pay $1000 from the $1500 saved in 10 months. The updated balance with Edoofa will be $500, which will be paid to the university upon your arrival in India.
6/3/24, 11:19 AM - Dev Edoofa: This eases the financial burden on the parent, as there is no immediate payment required upon the student's arrival. The $500 saved will cover the remaining fees for the semester/year, as specified in the offer letter from the university. What are your thoughts on this?
6/3/24, 11:24 AM - +263 71 724 6985: It seems logical
6/3/24, 11:26 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to see that we are together so far. With this plan for the next 10 months, I am sure you must be wondering what will happen in the next 10 months, considering you have already secured your scholarship seat with the university due to your hard work in the first 10 months. Is my understanding correct?
6/3/24, 11:27 AM - +263 71 724 6985: It is correct
6/3/24, 11:28 AM - Dev Edoofa: Let me help you with that as well. In the 11th month, you will be guided to open an FBC Mastercard bank account in Zimbabwe with a deposit of $150. The reason for this is that when you apply for your student Visa, the Embassy asks for a Bank Statement, and this account will serve that purpose.
6/3/24, 11:28 AM - Dev Edoofa: We understand it might be expensive if you deposit another $1500 for the remaining 10 months in FB  Bank Zimbabwe, so to avoid the same challenges, we have designed the plan accordingly. You will only be depositing for the 11th, 12th, 13th, and 14th month, which is 4 months.
6/3/24, 11:28 AM - Dev Edoofa: Once the 4 months are completed, our Department of Student Welfare (DSW) team will assist you with your visa process. The bank statement will act as one of the required documents, and once you receive the visa, you can withdraw the amount from FBC and book the flight ticket. This will help you utilize the money as well. How does it sound?
6/3/24, 11:30 AM - +263 71 724 6985: It sounds great
6/3/24, 11:31 AM - Dev Edoofa: Now, from the 16th Month till the 20th month, considering it is a 6-month window, you can again continue depositing the money ($150) with Edoofa which can be used in the fee as and when required or you can decide to save this $900 of these 6 months with you as well. This is something which you are free to choose. I hope you understand the financial secure plan now?
6/3/24, 11:32 AM - +263 71 724 6985: I now understand
6/3/24, 11:32 AM - Dev Edoofa: That's great. Now that you have all the information, I want you to take some time and discuss the financial security plan with your family members. Help them understand its importance and details. Once you're done, we can reconnect, have a discussion, and address any queries you may have. After resolving your concerns, I'll guide you through starting your financial security plan.
6/3/24, 11:32 AM - Dev Edoofa: Could you let me know when you think you'll have the discussion with your family? This way, we can schedule our next session accordingly.
6/3/24, 11:37 AM - +263 71 724 6985: Maybe later tomorrow so that we have enough time to discuss and think about it before we can reach an agreement
6/3/24, 11:37 AM - +263 71 724 6985: We will update once we sit together as a family and agree
6/3/24, 11:38 AM - Dev Edoofa: That's perfectly fine. In that case, we will conclude today's conversation, and I will connect with you tomorrow to resume our discussion. In the meantime, I hope you'll have a detailed discussion with your family and jot down any questions or thoughts you have regarding the Financial Secure plan.

Wishing you a good day ahead, and please extend our regards to your family.
6/3/24, 11:38 AM - +263 71 724 6985: Thank you, have a good day too
6/3/24, 11:38 AM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you. Also, there is one more thing, that I need to convey to you
6/3/24, 11:39 AM - +263 71 724 6985: Which is !?!
6/3/24, 11:39 AM - Dev Edoofa: As promised, now that you are a part of the Edoofa Journey, the opportunity to help you self-fund your higher education and for you to be industry-ready s here, and in light of the same, I would like to assist you in getting started with your EWYL Journey. Based on your EWYL application form, you are scheduled to commence your EWYL journey on Friday (8 March 2024).
6/3/24, 11:39 AM - Dev Edoofa: With your intention and commencement date in mind, we have already communicated this information to the EWYL team. They are prepared to initiate your EWYL program on Friday, as previously agreed upon.

To kick start the process, your dedicated EWYL Mentor has established your EWYL Group and shared the invitation link with us. Here's what you and your parents/guardian/sponsor need to do:

Please, how are you doing today? With regards to our discussion yesterday, I wanted to reach out and enquire if you are available for us to have a brief conversation?
8/3/24, 10:15 AM - +263 71 724 6985: I am available. Mr Sithole won't be joining us today. He is busy
8/3/24, 10:16 AM - Dev Edoofa: I understand, Mrs. Sithole. We can get caught up in our day to day work.
8/3/24, 10:16 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you are available for us to connect with each other. Before reaching out to you today, I was going through pictures and videos from Edoofa's very first SLICE CON held in January, and that sparked my curiosity about whether you are familiar with what SLICE CON is or not?
8/3/24, 10:17 AM - +263 71 724 6985: I'm not familiar with it
8/3/24, 10:18 AM - Dev Edoofa: That is alright, Let me tell you a bit about the same.  Recently, Edoofa hosted a conference called the Symposium of Leaders, Innovators, and Creators at Edoofa, also known as 'SLICE-CON.'
8/3/24, 10:18 AM - Dev Edoofa: The conference was attended by all the Edoofians of 2023 and a few senior Edoofians from previous batches. It focused on the art of creation, innovation, and, most importantly, the mindset required to make an impact in one's career.
8/3/24, 10:18 AM - Dev Edoofa: During this Industrial Visit and the conference - SLICE CON, Corporate leaders, such as the CEOs and Co-founders from renowned companies like Rage Coffee, Sirona Hygiene, Jolin New York, and more, shared their insights and experiences. These individuals are at the helm of multi-millionaire brands, leading large marketing teams. Their presence added immense value, providing students with the opportunity to engage in transformative conversations.
8/3/24, 10:18 AM - Dev Edoofa: Let me share a glimpse of the conference with you and your family. I am certain that Shalom too would be this excited to attend such events when she comes to India.

8/3/24, 10:21 AM - Dev Edoofa: Let me know once you are able to go through the messages about the SLICE CON, along with the images and videos shared with you. This was indeed a momentous step for all of our students, making them employable-ready and giving them access to the right opportunities for their careers ahead.
8/3/24, 10:25 AM - +263 71 724 6985: I have gone through the images and video
8/3/24, 10:30 AM - Dev Edoofa: Certainly, Mrs. Sithole. Also, regarding the discussion we had the other day about the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan, I wanted to follow up on our last conversation. Have you, as a family, been able to discuss it? If so, I would like to understand how the discussion went. What were their thoughts about it? Did they have any specific queries or concerns that you would like us to address?
8/3/24, 10:38 AM - +263 71 724 6985: We discussed about it and agreed that we are not yet ready. It took us a long time to raise the balance/shortfall which was required so right now we are not financially ready to be saving $150 every month
8/3/24, 10:50 AM - Dev Edoofa: I understand, Mrs. Sithole, but may I know what financial challenges are facing in saving $159 every month? It will help us to tackle the challenges that you are facing and align ourselves accordingly.
8/3/24, 10:56 AM - +263 71 724 6985: Our income right now is moderate or rather little for us to engage in savings of that amount. It is only enough to cover our day to day expenses that is why it took us long to get balance for registration.
8/3/24, 11:05 AM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for letting us know about the challenges that you are facing. I believe may I know if you have prepared a personal plan so that you can manage to pay the registration fees as well as the fees for Shalom's higher education? The admission processes for the year 2025 are going to commence from, August 2024. When Shalom receives the offer letter, you will have to pay $500-$1000 registration fees within 15 days of receiving it, which is a hefty amount to pay in one go. So, may I know if you have prepared a plan to cater to this need?
8/3/24, 11:11 AM - +263 71 724 6985: For now we are working on increasing our income and we will begin to start saving small amount until we reach the required amount
8/3/24, 11:26 AM - Dev Edoofa: Thanks for letting me know. But I want to understand that since it is not a stipulated amount that you are going to save every month, in the end, you will have to pay the registration fee as well as the first-semester fee of Shalom anyhow, so how are you planning to tackle the situation if you are not able to save that much?
8/3/24, 11:44 AM - +263 71 724 6985: For now we don't have a definite answer but we will surely make a plan when the time comes. 
Like I highlighted earlier, we are still looking for means to increase our income. If we fail, we will try to engage other relatives to chip in
8/3/24, 11:53 AM - Dev Edoofa: I completely understand your genuine concern. However, I wanted to help you understand, that 20-30% of students who enroll in the Edoofa Scholarship Program, every year are unable to come to India due to poor preparation of Finances. To solve this recurrence, Edoofa designed the Edoofa Secure Plan to ensure that students should not be able to let go of the golden opportunity to grow just because of poor preparation of finances. I understand the financial constraints that you may have in the future, but I also believe that you want to see Shalom become a successful individual in her respective field of study and moreover, life. The purpose of this plan is to help the parents save $1500 at the end of 10 months, i.e. January. This will greatly help the parents to ensure that their children can grab seats before other students as well as help the parents to prepare for the finances for the whole year and, not to forget the added benefits that were mentioned above. I hope understand what I am trying to convey?
8/3/24, 11:54 AM - +263 71 724 6985: I understand
8/3/24, 11:56 AM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for understanding. I would recommend you that as a family, factor in the above conversation and try to make the best decision for you and Shalom. I hope you would agree with this suggestion?
8/3/24, 11:59 AM - +263 71 724 6985: We will do our best
8/3/24, 12:21 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that! We will connect tomorrow. Till then I wish you a blessed day ahead.
