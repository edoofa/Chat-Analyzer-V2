4/3/24, 9:31 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Since this is the first time we are interacting with each other, I'm eager to learn more about you. Could you kindly provide an introduction of yourself and also share details about your family, sponsor, or guardians who will play a role in shaping your educational plans?
4/3/24, 9:53 AM - +263 71 771 3324: Sure sirI would be delighted to

My name is Aspire Pondwa. I am a teenage boy who aspires to become a software engineer. I grew up in Chitungwiza with my mother, who cared for me and my five siblings. Despite the many challenges she faced, she always found a way to pay my school fees at Zengeza 1 High School. My mother is my inspiration, my guardian, and my sponsor. Without her, I would not be where I am today. She will play an important role in shaping my educational plans and my future.
4/3/24, 10:03 AM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know about yourself, Aspire. I must truly commend your mother's hard work in supporting you and your siblings despite the many challenges she faced. I believe you are a sincere student and I truly believe you are going to make your mother proud with your achievements in the future.
4/3/24, 10:23 AM - +263 71 771 3324: Yes Sir, I am determined to. Thank you sir.
4/3/24, 10:23 AM - Dev Edoofa: You are most welcome. Since this is your admissions group, I believe you must have added your mother to the group. This will help them become familiar with the admission process and enable her to participate when required. Could you please confirm if she has already been added to the group? <This message was edited>
4/3/24, 10:25 AM - +263 71 771 3324: Yes she is in the group.
4/3/24, 10:25 AM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for this confirmation! Moving forward, I would like to bring an important aspect to your attention. The collective aim that we have for the student strongly values balanced involvement from parents, especially when the student is unable to participate. Your proactive engagement holds significant weight, and if, for any reason, either you or your guardians won't be available, we kindly request you to inform us beforehand so that we can plan and schedule our discussion beforehand. I hope you have taken note of this as well?
4/3/24, 10:33 AM - +263 71 771 3324: Yes, we will let you know when we are unavailable.
4/3/24, 10:33 AM - Dev Edoofa: Right, now moving forward, let me brief you that your admissions process and your EWYL program will operate concurrently in the future, therefore you will have two Whatsapp groups to connect with the team:
4/3/24, 10:34 AM - Dev Edoofa: 1. The admissions group *Aspire 2K24FEB2055*  will be the platform where we, as your admission officers, will be communicating with you. This group is dedicated to all-important discussions like your university admission process, offer letter discussion, and ultimately your university registration and reservation of your scholarship along with the Visa process. This group will continue to assist you with your admission-related queries while you are here in India.
4/3/24, 10:34 AM - Dev Edoofa: 2. Earn While You Learn Program *Aspire EWYL23E1344* . In this group, your EWYL mentor, head of the department, and head coach will be present. With this group, we will make sure you are prepared to self-finance your education here in India. With your dedicated efforts in the EWYL program, you will earn maximum scholarship credits.

This group will keep a record of the tasks and projects you undertake. You will be provided with the link to the group after the completion of the admission process session and on the dedicated date for your EWYL session, where you will be able to directly speak to your EWYL mentor. I hope you are clear about the purpose of the two groups.
4/3/24, 10:36 AM - +263 71 771 3324: Noted.
4/3/24, 10:36 AM - +263 71 771 3324: Yes I am clear.
4/3/24, 10:36 AM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. Moving forward in today's session, we will discuss a bit about your university admission journey. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts. I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them.

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
4/3/24, 10:37 AM - +263 71 771 3324: Yes, please do.
4/3/24, 10:37 AM - Dev Edoofa: <Media omitted>
4/3/24, 10:41 AM - +263 71 771 3324: Ok, i have gone through the process.
4/3/24, 10:42 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
4/3/24, 10:42 AM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
4/3/24, 10:48 AM - +263 71 771 3324: Yes, very clear.
4/3/24, 10:50 AM - Dev Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps - 

*Step 3: Introduction to the Financial Secure Plan* - Parents with children embarking on their university journey within the next one to two years face important decision-making and rigorous financial planning. Edoofa recognizes the significance of this transition and hence has introduced the Edoofa Secure Plan - a unique and systematic strategy to empower parents in financial planning and preparing for their child's tertiary education well in advance.
4/3/24, 10:50 AM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Scholarship Offer Letter from the university would be issued next year in the month of August.

I hope you are following?
4/3/24, 10:54 AM - +263 71 771 3324: Yes, i'm following.
4/3/24, 10:54 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. The registration fee will be paid through the savings you have accumulated visa the Financial Secure Plan. After the registration fee is paid, for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
4/3/24, 10:54 AM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
4/3/24, 10:58 AM - +263 71 771 3324: Yes, quite Vivid. Thank you for explaining Sir.
4/3/24, 10:58 AM - Dev Edoofa: You are most welcome. I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through all 6 steps, if we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
4/3/24, 11:00 AM - +263 71 771 3324: Ofcourse.
4/3/24, 11:00 AM - Dev Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
4/3/24, 11:00 AM - Dev Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding. Until you are ready, shall we start with our discussion with me individually? 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
4/3/24, 11:05 AM - +263 71 377 6677: How are you Mr Dev sorry to interrupt you bt l just want to know the due date for the amount to be paid
4/3/24, 11:05 AM - +263 71 771 3324: Yes, you may proceed.
4/3/24, 11:16 AM - +263 71 771 3324: She is referring to *Step 5*.
4/3/24, 11:18 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am doing absolutely fine @263713776677. No worries. The registration fee of $500-$1000 needs to be paid after 15 days of the issuance of the offer letter from the university. The admission process starts during the month of August. But since Aspire has taken an early step to enroll in the admission process, we, at Edoofa, are going to help you as a family to prepare the finances for the registration fee and make sure that you do not face any kind of difficulty in the admission process.
I hope I was able to clear your query?
4/3/24, 11:22 AM - +263 71 377 6677: Thank you so much Mr Dev
4/3/24, 11:23 AM - Dev Edoofa: You are most welcome! Let us proceed with the videos, 

*Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students*

This is a video by the founders of EDOOFA, in which they share 2 important qualities of successful Edoofians- who've secured a maximum scholarship and earned scholarship credits.

The third video is about Schools, Colleges, and Universities. I'm sure you're excited to learn more about the schools, colleges, and universities on the Edoofa Platform. Founders talk about their decade-long journey of discovering these schools and the experiences that students are having in these schools.

4/3/24, 11:24 AM - Dev Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP*

The fourth video is about the Statement of Purpose (SOP). The most important step towards securing a good scholarship is to write the Statement of Purpose but to know why it is important, watching this video will clear your doubts and questions.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftsGGGBYMrs&feature=youtu.be
4/3/24, 11:24 AM - Dev Edoofa: I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection.
4/3/24, 11:24 AM - Dev Edoofa: Please go through the 4 videos, and let me know whenever you are done with the same.
4/3/24, 11:33 AM - +263 71 771 3324: Ok Sir, I will go through them but unfortunately I'm not on a smooth Internet connection. I am using data bundles which are limited. I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.
4/3/24, 11:50 AM - Dev Edoofa: I understand, Aspire. No need to worry. In that case, we will be concluding the conversation for now and we will reconnect tomorrow at 10:30 AM for our next session. 

I hope by then you will be able to go through the videos. If you have any queries or concerns before then, feel free to share them here in your admission group. Wish you a blessed day ahead and please ensure to extend our regards to your family as well.
4/3/24, 11:53 AM - +263 71 771 3324: Ok thank you for understanding Sir.

5/3/24, 10:48 AM - Dev Edoofa: Greetings to you too @263713776677!
5/3/24, 10:59 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am hoping for a response to this question.
5/3/24, 11:09 AM - +263 71 771 3324: From the *first video*, I understood that learners should be teachable and open minded when it comes to education.

From the *Second video*, I undersrood that Edoofa is not only there to provide affordable high quality education but is also there to guide students to success and to make them employable through the EWYL program.

From the *third video*, I understood that Edoofa has invested 10 years to identify good schools, colleges and universities.  The founders encourage students to follow instructions so as to prepare them for these institutes.

From the *last video*, I understood that  I, the student,  should be prompt in taking action, and filling the statement of purpose with diligence.
5/3/24, 11:10 AM - Dev Edoofa: Brilliant, Aspire. I must commend your understanding of the 4 videos. Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose. I hope you were able to follow through with this?
5/3/24, 11:13 AM - +263 71 771 3324: Yes,
5/3/24, 11:14 AM - Dev Edoofa: Glad to hear that. Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by tomorrow before our session.
5/3/24, 11:14 AM - Dev Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

5/3/24, 4:22 PM - +263 71 771 3324: <Media omitted>
6/3/24, 10:42 AM - Dev Edoofa: Good Morning Parent and Aspire!
 I hope you are doing well. Thank you for sharing the screenshot of the filled statement of purpose. I have taken note of it and would also recommend you to share the answers to the questions on the document as well before our session at 2:00pm.
6/3/24, 10:51 AM - +263 71 377 6677: Morning Mr Dev and the Edoofa family
6/3/24, 10:56 AM - +263 71 771 3324: Good morning Sir.
6/3/24, 10:59 AM - Dev Edoofa: How are you all doing today?
6/3/24, 11:00 AM - +263 71 771 3324: Can i please ask on Question 2 - 5. Am i supposed to answer each question with a paragraph of 150-200 pages?
6/3/24, 11:01 AM - Dev Edoofa: You have to answer each question with a word limit of 150-200 words. I hope you are clear now?
6/3/24, 11:02 AM - +263 71 771 3324: Ok thank you sir
6/3/24, 11:03 AM - Dev Edoofa: You are welcome.

6/3/24, 11:13 AM - +263 71 771 3324: Here is the answer to number 1.
6/3/24, 11:50 AM - +263 71 771 3324: 2.)Primary memory and secondary memory are two different types of memory. Primary memory is used for immediate processing of information, while secondary memory is used for the long-term storage and retrieval of information. Primary memory includes working memory, which temporarily holds information that is being processed, and sensory memory, which stores information that is received through the senses. Secondary memory includes episodic memory, which stores information about specific events, and sematic memory, which stores general knowledge and facts. 

*Examples of primary memory are*: 

1.)Random access memory. This is the main memory where the operating system, application programs, and current processed data reside, so that they can be quickly reached by the device's processor.The second example is the

2.)Cache memory, which is a smaller and faster type of volatile memory that stores copies of the data from frequently used main memory locations. 

*Examples of secondary memory* are:

1.)Hard disk drives-which are magnetic storage devices for large amounts of data, 

2.)Solid-state drives-which are faster storage devices with no moving parts.

3.)Optical disks-such as CDs, DVDs, and Blu-ray discs for storage media.

4.)Magnetic tape-used for backup and archival purposes. <This message was edited>
6/3/24, 12:53 PM - +263 71 771 3324: 3.) The Open System Interconnection(OSI) is a model of communication designed by the International Standards organization(ISO). The OSI model allows computers from different manufacturers or origin to be connected together. The idea is that suppliers must produce hardware or software to implement any of the seven layers while other suppliers provide those of other layers. This promotes standardization. The seven layers are:

1.)Application layer - defines how user applications interface or access communication services, initiates or accept a request, provide network applications like data transfer, messaging, operating system functions, etc.

2.)Presentation layer - deals with how information is represented, eg ASCII, adds formatting or data transformation, data compression and data encryption.

3.)Session layer - creates and terminates sessions, eg login session, file transfer session, adds traffic-flow control information, etc.

4.)Transport layer - allows error correction during transmission, maintains flow control, allows data recovery, and allows routing, addressing and multiplexing of signals.

5.)Network layer - adds sequencing and address information, sets logical protocols, creating frames.

6.)Data link layer - provides error-checking and formats data for physical transmisson, defined network type and packet sequencing, used for synchronisation.

7.)Physical layer - it is responsible for sending data and receiving data across a physical medium.
6/3/24, 1:22 PM - +263 71 771 3324: 4.)Operator overloading is a feature of some programming languages that allows you to redefine the behavior of operators for different types of data. Operator overloading can be useful for creating custom data types or for providing more intuitive behavior for certain operations. Here is how it is implemented in some popular languages.

1.)C++: In C++, you can overload operators by defining functions with special names. For example, to overload the "+" operator for a custom class, you can define a function named "operator+".

2.)Python: Python allows operator overloading through special methods like "-add-","-sub-", "-mul-", etc. These methods can be defined in a class to define the behavior of operators. For instance, of that class, 

3.)Java: Java does not support operator overloading for user-defined types. However, you can use methods with meaningful names to achieve similar functionality. 

Overall, operator overloading provides a way to customize how operators work with user-defined datatypes, making code more expensive, intuitive. <This message was edited>
6/3/24, 1:48 PM - +263 71 771 3324: 5.)Technology advancement plays a crucial role in driving economic growth for a country in several ways:

1. Increased productivity: Technology can automate tasks, streamline processes, and improve efficiency, leading to higher productivity levels across different sectors. This increased productivity can result in higher output and economic growth.

2. Innovation and new industries: Technology advancements often lead to the creation of new industries and business opportunities. This innovation can drive economic growth by opening up new markets, creating jobs, and increasing competitiveness. 

5. Access to new markets: Technology allows businesses to reach new markets and customers both domestically and internationally. This expanded market access can lead to increased sales, revenue, and economic growth.

6. Skill development: Technology advancements require a skilled workforce to develop, implement, and utilize new technologies. Investing in education and training programs can help develop a highly skilled workforce, which in turn can drive economic growth through innovation and increased productivity.

Overall, technology advancement plays a critical role in boosting a country's economy by driving productivity, fostering innovation, enhancing competitiveness, improving infrastructure, expanding market access, and developing a skilled workforce.
6/3/24, 1:52 PM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the answers to the questions on the document. I have taken complete note of it and updated these in our records as well. I must appreciate your proactiveness towards the admission process and the tasks assigned to you. Now, may I know if you are ready to take forward our session?
6/3/24, 1:55 PM - +263 71 771 3324: Yes
6/3/24, 1:55 PM - +263 71 771 3324: I am ready.
6/3/24, 1:56 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that! With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey, i.e. *Introduction to Financial Secure Plan*.
6/3/24, 1:56 PM - Dev Edoofa: However, before we start the same, I was going through your scholarship application file and noticed that you are supposed to make the payment of your remaining part of Edoofa Enrollment fee. Hence, I thought of sharing a gentle reminder with you and trying to understand how your preparation has been so far? Have you been able to align your preparations in the right direction?
6/3/24, 1:57 PM - +263 71 771 3324: Before we start, i could not get the recommendation letter because there was a function at our school. The headmaster was very busy.
6/3/24, 1:58 PM - Dev Edoofa: I understand! No worries. We can move ahead with our session.
6/3/24, 1:58 PM - Dev Edoofa: May I please get an update on this?
6/3/24, 2:00 PM - +263 71 771 3324: Yes i have. Can I please know the remaining amount.
6/3/24, 2:01 PM - Dev Edoofa: The remaining amount is $150 which is due on 27th March 2024.
6/3/24, 2:03 PM - Dev Edoofa: I hope you have taken note of the above information as per your acceptance letter. In the meantime, Let us move forward with our discussion. To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is B.Tech (Computer Science Engineering) and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India in August 2025. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
6/3/24, 2:12 PM - Dev Edoofa: Are you still available, Aspire?
6/3/24, 2:17 PM - +263 71 771 3324: Ok
6/3/24, 2:17 PM - +263 71 771 3324: Yes, it is
6/3/24, 2:18 PM - +263 71 771 3324: Sorry for the late response
6/3/24, 2:18 PM - Dev Edoofa: No worries! 
Thank you for your confirmation. Based on our experience of over 14 years and having assisted over 5000 students from different countries, we have realized that financial planning is the most important factor when a student plans for their higher education abroad.
6/3/24, 2:18 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am sure that you must be aware that 20-30% of students who are admitted into universities abroad are unable to fulfill their dream and come to India due to a lack of financial planning. The funds needed for booking flights, accommodation, and covering living expenses after arrival often become overwhelming, leading to the decision to defer their admission for a year. This, in turn, creates a gap in the child's education.
6/3/24, 2:18 PM - Dev Edoofa: To assist both students and parents in this regard, Edoofa Management has designed a Financial Secure Plan that aims to help you prepare for your higher educational finances without experiencing stress or last-minute rushes. I believe you must be wondering about the details of the same plan and how it helps the parents?
6/3/24, 2:22 PM - +263 71 771 3324: Yes, can you please enlighten me.
6/3/24, 2:24 PM - Dev Edoofa: Sure, Aspire. Edoofa Secure Plan is important for parents who have children joining the university for tertiary education in the next one to two years for several reasons:
6/3/24, 2:24 PM - Dev Edoofa: 1. *Financial Preparedness:* The Edoofa Secure plan helps parents prepare financially for the costs after the Scholarship being offered so that they are not caught off guard.

2. *Reduced Financial Stress:* Having the Edoofa Secure Plan in place can significantly reduce the financial stress on you as parents when your child is about to enter university. Knowing that there is a dedicated fund for education expenses provides peace of mind.
6/3/24, 2:24 PM - Dev Edoofa: 3. *Avoiding Debt*: Without proper savings, some parents may resort to taking out loans or accumulating credit card debt to cover their child's education costs. This Educational savings plan helps avoid the burden of debt and high-interest payments.

4. *Compound Interest:* By starting to save early and consistently contributing to the savings plan, parents can take advantage of compound interest, which can significantly increase the amount available for education expenses.
6/3/24, 2:24 PM - Dev Edoofa: 5. *Flexibility and Control:* The Edoofa Secure savings plans allow parents to have greater control over their finances and how they allocate funds for their child's education. They can choose investment options that align with their risk tolerance and financial goals.

6. *Encouraging Responsibility*: Involving your child in the process of saving for their education teaches them financial responsibility and the value of higher education. It also motivates them to outperform in Academics.
6/3/24, 2:24 PM - Dev Edoofa: 7. *Adapting to Unexpected Changes*: Life is full of surprises, and circumstances can change especially when there are political reforms changing each day impacting the Local Currency. Having an Edoofa Secure Plan allows parents to adapt to unexpected changes in their financial situation while still prioritizing their child's education.

8. *Peace of Mind:* Overall, having the Edoofa Secure plan provides parents with peace of mind, knowing that they are actively planning for their child's future and increasing the likelihood of providing them with a solid education.
6/3/24, 2:24 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, when you go through all the above benefits, I am sure you can see that the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan is an important financial tool for parents/students who are supposed to enter the university soon. 

It helps ensure that the financial aspect of tertiary education is well-managed, reduces stress, and allows parents to provide the best opportunities for their children without resorting to debt or financial hardship. Isn't this something you and your family also wish to have?
6/3/24, 2:29 PM - +263 71 771 3324: Yes, definitely.
6/3/24, 2:29 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through the above points, do you want me to help you understand how the Edoofa Secure Plan works?
6/3/24, 2:29 PM - +263 71 771 3324: Yes
6/3/24, 2:30 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, as you are aware, we are currently in March 2024, and we have a good 20 months to plan for your finances before you start your university education in 2025.
6/3/24, 2:30 PM - Dev Edoofa: During the counseling session, you were informed that at Edoofa, we guarantee a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship on the tuition fees. Hence, the cost of education, including food and accommodation after the scholarship, would be between $2000-$3000, and it could be even less. Not more than that.
6/3/24, 2:30 PM - Dev Edoofa: This means that if you can save $150 per month for the next 20 months, you will be able to save $3000. This amount is more than enough for the first year of university fees, including tuition fees (if any), food, and accommodation. I hope you agree with this?
6/3/24, 2:31 PM - +263 71 771 3324: Yes, i agree.
6/3/24, 2:33 PM - Dev Edoofa: Right, this means that by the time you would be in India, you would have already saved the $3000 that will cover the first-year fee.
6/3/24, 2:33 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, in these next 20 months, I am sure you would also be engaged in the EWYL program, and if you secure a minimum of $1000 in 20 months, that means the fees for 1.5 years are already secured.
6/3/24, 2:33 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, for a 3-year course, if we follow the same approach for the remaining 1.5 years, the educational journey for the student and the financial journey for the parent will be easy and smooth. I believe you must be able to see this perspective?
6/3/24, 2:35 PM - +263 71 771 3324: That's wonderful
6/3/24, 2:35 PM - +263 71 771 3324: Yes I can see it clearly.
6/3/24, 2:38 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. With that said, there is also another benefit, I am sure being in Zimbabwe you know how drastically the exchange rate fluctuates.
6/3/24, 2:38 PM - Dev Edoofa: If you are buying a dollar today, you might be spending 7000 bonds, but if you buy a dollar after a month, the rate would be different.
6/3/24, 2:38 PM - Dev Edoofa: Also, even if you choose to buy dollars every month and save at your home, it is not safe since there is news of robbery, and mugging every day.
6/3/24, 2:38 PM - Dev Edoofa: In that case, you will opt to save in the Bank, but again we know that savings in the Bank require a Nostro Account which means you have to pay the bank to keep your money safe, right?
6/3/24, 2:40 PM - +263 71 771 3324: Yes, but do not worry about the money being robbed sir, we will keep it safe.
6/3/24, 2:41 PM - Dev Edoofa: That is great to hear. Considering these constraints, Edoofa Management has decided to help the parents and students prepare for the journey way ahead of time by helping them save money with Edoofa without any additional charges but rather saving additional money as well. Do you want me to explain how this has been achieved?
6/3/24, 2:43 PM - +263 71 771 3324: Yes please do.
6/3/24, 2:43 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Program Fee (Enrollment Fee) that you were asked to pay is $350. From the $350, you have already paid $200, and the remaining $150 is what you are planning to pay before your due date of *March 27, 2024*.
6/3/24, 2:44 PM - Dev Edoofa: Under the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan, a parent has to deposit a small amount of money which is $150 every month for the next 10 months. 

That means, in 10 months, the money saved will be $1500. When this money is saved, Edoofa will waive off the remaining $150 which was due from the Edoofa Program/Enrollment Fee of $350, thereby making a straight saving of $150 in 10 months.
6/3/24, 2:44 PM - Dev Edoofa: Imagine you paying $15 every month to the Bank of Zimbabwe to keep your money safe, and here Edoofa is paying you $15 every month to keep your money safe. Now, you must be wondering, why only for 10 months and not for 20 months, right?
6/3/24, 2:47 PM - +263 71 771 3324: Yes
6/3/24, 2:48 PM - +263 71 771 3324: Ok
6/3/24, 2:49 PM - +263 71 771 3324: Yes, can i know why.
6/3/24, 2:49 PM - Dev Edoofa: Sure. If you see the bigger picture, you will realize that the reason is quite simple. Upon the completion of the 10 installments, the Edoofa Admissions team will initiate the Child’s Admission Process by applying early to the universities to secure their scholarship and their university seat.
6/3/24, 2:49 PM - Dev Edoofa: Reserving seats earlier increases the chances of obtaining a maximum scholarship. A higher scholarship means lower fees, and by securing the seat, you will be entitled to pay the fees as per the old fee structure of the university, not the new one implemented in January 2025. Furthermore, when applying to the universities, you will receive an offer letter or a letter of intent detailing the fees, scholarship, and registration fees.
6/3/24, 2:49 PM - Dev Edoofa: As explained during the enrollment process, the registration fee is a portion of your first-year university fee, paid to reserve the seat. It ranges from $500-$1000 and is not an additional fee. 

From the $1500 you saved with Edoofa, the registration fee will be paid to the university, securing the seat. For instance, if the registration fee is $1000, Edoofa will pay $1000 from the $1500 saved in 10 months. The updated balance with Edoofa will be $500, which will be paid to the university upon your arrival in India.
6/3/24, 2:49 PM - Dev Edoofa: This eases the financial burden on the parent, as there is no immediate payment required upon the student's arrival. The $500 saved will cover the remaining fees for the semester/year, as specified in the offer letter from the university. What are your thoughts on this?
6/3/24, 2:54 PM - +263 71 771 3324: I think that's really helpful.
6/3/24, 2:54 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to see that we are together so far. With this plan for the next 10 months, I am sure you must be wondering what will happen in the next 10 months, considering you have already secured your scholarship seat with the university due to your hard work in the first 10 months. Is my understanding correct?
6/3/24, 2:56 PM - +263 71 771 3324: Yes
6/3/24, 2:57 PM - Dev Edoofa: Let me help you with that as well. In the 11th month, you will be guided to open an FBC Mastercard bank account in Zimbabwe with a deposit of $150. The reason for this is that when you apply for your student Visa, the Embassy asks for a Bank Statement, and this account will serve that purpose.
6/3/24, 2:57 PM - Dev Edoofa: We understand it might be expensive if you deposit another $1500 for the remaining 10 months in FB  Bank Zimbabwe, so to avoid the same challenges, we have designed the plan accordingly. You will only be depositing for the 11th, 12th, 13th, and 14th month, which is 4 months.
6/3/24, 2:57 PM - Dev Edoofa: Once the 4 months are completed, our Department of Student Welfare (DSW) team will assist you with your visa process. The bank statement will act as one of the required documents, and once you receive the visa, you can withdraw the amount from FBC and book the flight ticket. This will help you utilize the money as well. How does it sound?
6/3/24, 2:58 PM - +263 71 771 3324: Sounds good.
6/3/24, 2:59 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, from the 16th Month till the 20th month, considering it is a 6-month window, you can again continue depositing the money ($150) with Edoofa which can be used in the fee as and when required or you can decide to save this $900 of these 6 months with you as well. This is something which you are free to choose. I hope you have understood the financial secure plan now?
6/3/24, 3:00 PM - +263 71 771 3324: Yes Sir and i would like  to discuss with my parent. She was not in the discussion. <This message was edited>
6/3/24, 3:04 PM - Dev Edoofa: I understand, Aspire. Now that you have all the information, I want you to take some time and discuss the financial security plan with your family members. Help them understand its importance and details. Once you're done, we can reconnect, have a discussion, and address any queries you may have. After resolving your concerns, I'll guide you through starting your financial security plan. 

While most students can discuss this with their family the same day, I understand everyone is different. Could you let me know when you think you'll have the discussion with your family? This way, we can schedule our next session accordingly.
