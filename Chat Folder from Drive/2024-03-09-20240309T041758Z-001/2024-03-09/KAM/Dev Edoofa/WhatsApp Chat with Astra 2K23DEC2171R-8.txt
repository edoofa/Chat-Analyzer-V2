8/1/24, 8:49 PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Astra!
I hope all of you are doing great. While I was wrapping up my day, I observed that we were not able to have a smooth discussion for the past couple of days, which has led to some delay in the admission process. We are aware of your immense trust in us and we surely care about your future. Considering that in mind, I wanted to schedule a specific session tomorrow at 8:30 am so that we can cover the process we are lagging behind,  and ensure that your admission process is on track. Hence, I wanted to understand if you will be available for our session at 8:30am. If not, I would like you to please let me know at what time between 8:30 am to 4 pm will you be available?
9/1/24, 10:17 AM - Dev Edoofa: Shall we start with our session?
9/1/24, 8:05 PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Astra.

I hope all of you are having a wonderful day. Today I had a meeting with the academic board and I was discussing the current status of your application file and in the same discussion, the team higjlighted that we have been a bit off track for the discusisons we were suppsed to completed and hence I wanted to reach out to you and just reiteratre the agenda of the sessions/discusisons we have in place.
9/1/24, 8:06 PM - Dev Edoofa: The agenda for these sessions is to help you understand the process Astra will undertake for his university admission journey and what your family will be experiencing with the Edoofa Scholarship Program over the next one and a half years. However, since Astra is in school and you are occupied with work during the day, it seems that the same challenge in connectivity is going to persist for the next couple of months as well.
9/1/24, 8:06 PM - Dev Edoofa: If you see, our goal is to help you prepare for your child's education abroad, that is something that is going to require a significant time. It requires months of planning. Hence, to do that perfectly and be prepared, as a parent, you would have to contribute an hour daily for at least 10 days so that we can be in sync and make the right decisions.
9/1/24, 8:06 PM - Dev Edoofa: We, at Edoofa, are determined to provide affordable higher education to hardworking students and assist them in launching their careers to greater heights. We will be able to help you only if we can connect timely and have healthy discussions.
9/1/24, 8:06 PM - Dev Edoofa: With that being said, what I can do right now to solve this constraint is give you the freedom to choose the time slot for our sessions over the next 10 days [till 20th January]. This way, we can align it with our availability as well and help you move forward and make progress in a streamlined manner. Could you please let me know at what time you would be available from Monday to Friday between 08:00 AM and 06:00 PM? This would help us factor in your inputs and find the right time for our sessions.
10/1/24, 6:16 PM - +263 71 905 3634: Greetings
10/1/24, 6:25 PM - +263 71 905 3634: Because of the nature of my job.I can not simply say, I will be free what time ,Because during the day I will be out in the field  where by they is no proper network but I will answer your questions ,where ever is possible

15/1/24, 2:06 PM - Dev Edoofa: Till then, With great excitement and pride, I want to share that over the past few days, the Edoofa team has been immersed in an exciting event we had in store for our students. Edoofa hosted a conference - the Symposium of Leaders, Innovators, and Creators at Edoofa, also known as 'SLICE-CON.'

The conference was attended by all the Edoofians of 2023 and a few senior Edoofians from previous batches. It focused on the art of creation, innovation, and, most importantly, the mindset required to make an impact in one's career.
15/1/24, 2:06 PM - Dev Edoofa: During this Industrial Visit and the conference - SLICE CON, Corporate leaders, such as the CEOs and Co-founders from renowned companies like Rage Coffee, Sirona Hygiene, Jolin New York, and more, shared their insights and experience. These individuals are at the helm of multi-millionaire brands, leading large marketing teams. Their presence added immense value, providing students with the opportunity to engage in transformative conversations.
15/1/24, 2:06 PM - Dev Edoofa: We believe that interactions with such industry leaders can bring significant transformations to students' lives, enhancing their business acumen. Our Edoofians maximized this opportunity, having life-changing conversations with these influential figures. The main objective of the event was to emphasize the importance of thinking outside the box, encouraging students to believe in themselves and their dreams. Before we start our session today, I wanted to share a glimpse of the event, and I hope you are excited to attend similar events when you come to India.

I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them.

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
29/1/24, 10:05 AM - Dev Edoofa: Shall we move ahead?
29/1/24, 10:05 AM - +263 71 905 3634: Yes we can start
29/1/24, 10:08 AM - Dev Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/1/24, 10:13 AM - +263 71 905 3634: I am done proceed
29/1/24, 10:18 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
29/1/24, 10:18 AM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
29/1/24, 10:24 AM - +263 71 905 3634: Yes very clear. So the stage one we will expect videos from your admin right?.

And stage 2 will it be a written document with given structure which Astra will write to you but on a given format?
29/1/24, 10:28 AM - Dev Edoofa: Yes, @263719053634. You are somewhat correct but I will tell you about the steps in detail when we reach them. Till that time I would suggest you to pay attention to how the journey of Astra's admission is going to look like. Shall we move forward?
29/1/24, 10:35 AM - +263 71 905 3634: Noted let's proceed
29/1/24, 10:39 AM - Dev Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps - 

*Step 3: Introduction to the Financial Secure Plan* - Parents with children embarking on their university journey within the next one to two years face important decision-making and rigorous financial planning. Edoofa recognizes the significance of this transition and hence has introduced the Edoofa Secure Plan - a unique and systematic strategy to empower parents in financial planning and preparing for their child's tertiary education well in advance.
29/1/24, 10:39 AM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Scholarship Offer Letter from the university would be issued next year in the month of August.

I hope you are following?
29/1/24, 10:46 AM - +263 71 905 3634: Do you mind explaining Further the financial secure plan so that we may understand  well and weigh it's Pros and Cons
29/1/24, 10:55 AM - +263 71 905 3634: The stage 4 l am following. Ok this means that offer letter will come after some rigorous evaluation from different Universities and the one that Make it Valid will provide offer letter ?
29/1/24, 10:55 AM - Dev Edoofa: It is a plan that we have designed to help parents prepare for their finances beforehand so that at the moment, the students do not face any roadblocks when they are due to come to India and can pursue higher education here. Also, Mr. Totamirepi, I want to iterate that for the time being, I would suggest you take note of the steps and focus on the journey. We will soon let you know about these steps when the time is right, so that you are not overwhelmed by information and eventually confusion. I hope you understand?
29/1/24, 10:59 AM - +263 71 905 3634: Understood Noted
29/1/24, 11:01 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. The registration fee will be paid through the savings you have accumulated visa the Financial Secure Plan. After the registration fee is paid, for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
29/1/24, 11:01 AM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
29/1/24, 11:12 AM - +263 71 905 3634: These are clear only further explanation of the steps or stages in detail as we reach there like you mentioned earlier
29/1/24, 11:13 AM - Dev Edoofa: Yes, Mr. Totamirepi! I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through all 6 steps, if we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
29/1/24, 11:15 AM - +263 71 905 3634: Yes Let's start now
29/1/24, 11:16 AM - Dev Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
29/1/24, 11:16 AM - Dev Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding. For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
29/1/24, 11:27 AM - +263 71 905 3634: Yes you can share

29/1/24, 11:29 AM - Dev Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP*

The fourth video is about the Statement of Purpose (SOP). The most important step towards securing a good scholarship is to write the Statement of Purpose but to know why it is important, watching this video will clear your doubts and questions.

Till that time, I would like you to share your understanding of the videos, whenever you are done watching the videos shared with you. I hope you are clear with this?
29/1/24, 4:03 PM - +263 71 905 3634: Despite the fact that videos are at a less controlled noise the message is clear 

Video 4. The understanding is clearing the mist within the SOP prepared by the students who expect to successfully enrollment as well as highlighting it's advantages

29/1/24, 4:04 PM - +263 71 905 3634: Good Afternoon  sir
29/1/24, 4:19 PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Afternoon Mr. Totamirepi.

Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  I hope you were able to follow through with this?

29/1/24, 4:31 PM - +263 71 905 3634: Yes l was able to follow we can move on
29/1/24, 4:32 PM - Dev Edoofa: That's great!
29/1/24, 4:34 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move Astra's application ahead and help Astra write a proper statement of purpose so that she can get into the best University that provides quality education that leads to a Job. So, for the team to work on Astra's application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, we would require Astra's availability for approximately 30 minutes. she is unavailable, she can provide you with his/her input, and you can proceed with the statement of purpose on her behalf.
29/1/24, 4:35 PM - Dev Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in Astra's admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded.

29/1/24, 4:41 PM - Dev Edoofa: Yes, Mr. Totamirepi. That is correct!
29/1/24, 4:41 PM - +263 71 905 3634: Noted
29/1/24, 4:42 PM - Dev Edoofa: May I know when will Astra be able to complete these tasks?
29/1/24, 4:44 PM - +263 71 905 3634: I will check with her teachers and advise shortly

31/1/24, 10:18 PM - +263 71 905 3634: Yes we are still awaits for her availability anytime this week
1/2/24, 11:50 AM - Dev Edoofa: Good Afternoon @263719053634!
I hope you are doing well. Thanks for letting me know. I have taken note of this. But, I also wanted to tell you that we are already lagging behind a lot in the admission process. So, please make sure that you are completing the tasks on a priority.
1/2/24, 5:49 PM - +263 71 905 3634: Good Evening sir
1/2/24, 5:49 PM - +263 71 905 3634: Noted
2/2/24, 1:45 PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Afternoon @263719053634!
I hope you are doing well. May I know if you are available to take forward Astra's admission journey? Astra can complete the tasks whenever she is available. This will ensure that Astra's admission process is not affected.
2/2/24, 3:27 PM - +263 71 905 3634: Yes we can carry forward the conversation.
2/2/24, 3:29 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that! We can now to progress to the third step in your admission journey, i.e. *Introduction to Financial Secure Plan*.
2/2/24, 3:31 PM - Dev Edoofa: Let us move forward with our discussion. To confirm our records: the course Astra has selected for her higher education is B.Sc (Medical Lab Technology) and it's my understanding that she is planning to arrive in India in August 2025. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate? <This message was edited>
2/2/24, 3:37 PM - +263 71 905 3634: Very accurate thus it and the program is correct
2/2/24, 3:48 PM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. Based on our experience of over 14 years and having assisted over 5000 students from different countries, we have realized that financial planning is the most important factor when a student plans for their higher education abroad.
2/2/24, 3:48 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am sure that you must be aware that 20-30% of students who are admitted into universities abroad are unable to fulfill their dream and come to India due to a lack of financial planning. The funds needed for booking flights, accommodation, and covering living expenses after arrival often become overwhelming, leading to the decision to defer their admission for a year. This, in turn, creates a gap in the child's education.
2/2/24, 3:48 PM - Dev Edoofa: To assist both students and parents in this regard, Edoofa Management has designed a Financial Secure Plan that aims to help you prepare for your higher educational finances without experiencing stress or last-minute rushes. I believe you must be wondering about the details of the same plan and how it helps the parents?
2/2/24, 3:56 PM - +263 71 905 3634: Yes l wish to learn more on the advantages and disadvantages as well as the nature of this financial Plan
2/2/24, 3:57 PM - Dev Edoofa: Edoofa Secure Plan is important for parents who have children joining the university for tertiary education in the next one to two years for several reasons:
2/2/24, 3:57 PM - Dev Edoofa: 1. *Financial Preparedness:* The Edoofa Secure plan helps parents prepare financially for the costs after the Scholarship being offered so that they are not caught off guard.

2. *Reduced Financial Stress:* Having the Edoofa Secure Plan in place can significantly reduce the financial stress on you as parents when your child is about to enter university. Knowing that there is a dedicated fund for education expenses provides peace of mind.
2/2/24, 3:57 PM - Dev Edoofa: 3. *Avoiding Debt*: Without proper savings, some parents may resort to taking out loans or accumulating credit card debt to cover their child's education costs. This Educational savings plan helps avoid the burden of debt and high-interest payments.

4. *Compound Interest:* By starting to save early and consistently contributing to the savings plan, parents can take advantage of compound interest, which can significantly increase the amount available for education expenses.
2/2/24, 3:57 PM - Dev Edoofa: 5. *Flexibility and Control:* The Edoofa Secure savings plans allow parents to have greater control over their finances and how they allocate funds for their child's education. They can choose investment options that align with their risk tolerance and financial goals.

6. *Encouraging Responsibility*: Involving your child in the process of saving for their education teaches them financial responsibility and the value of higher education. It also motivates them to outperform in Academics.
2/2/24, 3:57 PM - Dev Edoofa: 7. *Adapting to Unexpected Changes*: Life is full of surprises, and circumstances can change especially when there are political reforms changing each day impacting the Local Currency. Having an Edoofa Secure Plan allows parents to adapt to unexpected changes in their financial situation while still prioritizing their child's education.

8. *Peace of Mind:* Overall, having the Edoofa Secure plan provides parents with peace of mind, knowing that they are actively planning for their child's future and increasing the likelihood of providing them with a solid education.
2/2/24, 3:57 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, when you go through all the above benefits, I am sure you can see that the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan is an important financial tool for parents/students who are supposed to enter the university soon. 

It helps ensure that the financial aspect of tertiary education is well-managed, reduces stress, and allows parents to provide the best opportunities for their children without resorting to debt or financial hardship. Isn't this something you and your family also wish to have?
2/2/24, 4:03 PM - +263 71 905 3634: We  may wish to have that but what is the nature or this plan since the benefits have been received
2/2/24, 4:10 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that let me help you with it. As you are aware, we are currently in February 2024, and we have a good 20 months to plan for your finances before you start your university education in 2025.
2/2/24, 4:10 PM - Dev Edoofa: During the counseling session, you were informed that at Edoofa, we guarantee a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship on the tuition fees. Hence, the cost of education, including food and accommodation after the scholarship, would be between $2000-$3000, and it could be even less. Not more than that.
2/2/24, 4:10 PM - Dev Edoofa: This means that if you can save $150 per month for the next 20 months, you will be able to save $3000. This amount is more than enough for the first year of university fees, including tuition fees (if any), food, and accommodation. I hope you agree with this?
2/2/24, 4:20 PM - +263 71 905 3634: Yes l understand that
2/2/24, 5:21 PM - Dev Edoofa: Right, this means that by the time you would be in India, you would have already saved the $3000 that will cover the first-year fee.
2/2/24, 5:21 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, in these next 20 months, I am sure you would also be engaged in the EWYL program, and if you secure a minimum of $1000 in 20 months, that means the fees for 1.5 years are already secured.
2/2/24, 5:21 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, for a 3-year course, if we follow the same approach for the remaining 1.5 years, the educational journey for the student and the financial journey for the parent will be easy and smooth. I believe you must be able to see this perspective?
2/2/24, 5:27 PM - +263 71 905 3634: I am seeing it. So still what is the nature of the Edoofa Financial Secure plan
2/2/24, 5:33 PM - Dev Edoofa: Could help me by elaborating more on your question?
2/2/24, 5:56 PM - +263 71 905 3634: I understand all you have said but the nature of financial secure plan for Edoofa how is it like? You mean l calculate the money needed for the education and the budget to Edoofa scheme every month till the time or l just save at Home as advised?
2/2/24, 6:01 PM - Dev Edoofa: You need to save the amount with Edoofa because that will only mean that the plan is secure. I hope you understand and please allow me to move forward as the queries that arise in your mind will surely be cleared.
2/2/24, 6:34 PM - +263 71 905 3634: Go ahead
3/2/24, 7:51 AM - Dev Edoofa: Good Morning Mr. Totamirepi!
I hope you are doing well. Since at the time you replied our operational hours were over, I was not able to take forward the conversation. May I know if you are available to take forward the conversation today?
7/2/24, 9:29 AM - Dev Edoofa: Good Afternoon @263719053634 

I hope this message finds you well and filled with the same excitement that's buzzing here at Edoofa! It's that time of the year again when we eagerly anticipate our annual Meet and Greet Seminar in Harare. This event holds a special place in our hearts as it brings us closer to our community, and we're counting down the days with great anticipation! <This message was edited>
7/2/24, 9:30 AM - Dev Edoofa: Just like clockwork, we're gearing up for the seminar next week, and I couldn't resist sharing our enthusiasm with you. Your presence would truly make the event all the more meaningful, guiding you on your journey to India. Hence, with immense joy, we wanted to extend the special invitation for the Meet and Greet Seminar to you and your wonderful family.
7/2/24, 9:30 AM - Dev Edoofa: And in the process of doing the same, I happened to notice that you haven't started your EWYL Program by now. In light of this, I had a discussion with Ms. Sanjana, the head of the EWYL Department, and I am happy to share that she has graciously agreed to make a special exception for you, expediting your application process.
7/2/24, 9:30 AM - Dev Edoofa: As a result, I have gone ahead and created your very own dedicated EWYL Group - Astra EWYL23E1119, adding both you and your parents to the mix. If I have missed including any other family members, they can easily join using the following link: [https://chat.whatsapp.com/LdmDPMOnXCo0227VnTExwI].

Within the group, the EWYL team will not only guide you on the hows and whens of the EWYL Program but also share all the exciting details about the upcoming Meet and Greet Seminar in Harare. We are genuinely thrilled to witness you embark on this transformative journey, and we are rooting for your success every step of the way!

Warmest regards,
Admissions Team.
7/2/24, 11:57 AM - Dev Edoofa: Also, may I know when are you going to be available for our session today?
8/2/24, 1:57 PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Afternoon @263719053634!
I hope you are doing well. I was looking forward to a response from your side. May I know if we are still connected?
8/2/24, 2:38 PM - +263 71 905 3634: Good Afternoon sir
8/2/24, 2:38 PM - +263 71 905 3634: We may move forward
8/2/24, 2:47 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that! Now, picking up from our previous conversation, may I know if you were able to follow our last conversation?
8/2/24, 2:52 PM - +263 71 905 3634: Yes l was able to follow the conversation.
8/2/24, 2:55 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. With that said, there is also another benefit, I am sure being in Zimbabwe you know how drastically the exchange rate fluctuates.
8/2/24, 2:56 PM - Dev Edoofa: If you are buying a dollar today, you might be spending 7000 bonds, but if you buy a dollar after a month, the rate would be different.
8/2/24, 2:56 PM - Dev Edoofa: Also, even if you choose to buy dollars every month and save at your home, it is not safe since there is news of robbery, and mugging every day.
8/2/24, 2:56 PM - Dev Edoofa: In that case, you will opt to save in the Bank, but again we know that savings in the Bank require a Nostro Account which means you have to pay the bank to keep your money safe, right?
8/2/24, 3:10 PM - +263 71 905 3634: Yes thus true
8/2/24, 3:12 PM - Dev Edoofa: That is great to hear. Considering these constraints, Edoofa Management has decided to help the parents and students prepare for the journey way ahead of time by helping them save money with Edoofa without any additional charges but rather saving additional money as well. Do you want me to explain how this has been achieved?
8/2/24, 3:33 PM - +263 71 905 3634: Yes go ahead explain further
8/2/24, 3:37 PM - Dev Edoofa: This message was deleted
8/2/24, 3:37 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Program Fee (Enrollment Fee) that you were asked to pay is $350.
8/2/24, 3:37 PM - Dev Edoofa: Under the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan, a parent has to deposit a small amount of money which is $150 every month for the next 10 months. 

That means, in 10 months, the money saved will be $1500. When this money is saved, Edoofa will waive off  $150 which was from the Edoofa Program/Enrollment Fee of $350, thereby making a straight saving of $150 in 10 months.
8/2/24, 3:37 PM - Dev Edoofa: Imagine you paying $15 every month to the Bank of Zimbabwe to keep your money safe, and here Edoofa is paying you $15 every month to keep your money safe. Now, you must be wondering, why only for 10 months and not for 20 months, right?
8/2/24, 3:48 PM - +263 71 905 3634: It's understandable. But why 10 months only
8/2/24, 3:51 PM - Dev Edoofa: If you see the bigger picture, you will realize that the reason is quite simple. Upon the completion of the 10 installments, the Edoofa Admissions team will initiate the Child’s Admission Process by applying early to the universities to secure their scholarship and their university seat.
8/2/24, 3:51 PM - Dev Edoofa: Reserving seats earlier increases the chances of obtaining a maximum scholarship. A higher scholarship means lower fees, and by securing the seat, you will be entitled to pay the fees as per the old fee structure of the university, not the new one implemented in January 2025. Furthermore, when applying to the universities, you will receive an offer letter or a letter of intent detailing the fees, scholarship, and registration fees.
8/2/24, 3:51 PM - Dev Edoofa: As explained during the enrollment process, the registration fee is a portion of your first-year university fee, paid to reserve the seat. It ranges from $500-$1000 and is not an additional fee. 

From the $1500 you saved with Edoofa, the registration fee will be paid to the university, securing the seat. For instance, if the registration fee is $1000, Edoofa will pay $1000 from the $1500 saved in 10 months. The updated balance with Edoofa will be $500, which will be paid to the university upon your arrival in India.
8/2/24, 3:51 PM - Dev Edoofa: This eases the financial burden on the parent, as there is no immediate payment required upon the student's arrival. The $500 saved will cover the remaining fees for the semester/year, as specified in the offer letter from the university. What are your thoughts on this?
8/2/24, 4:32 PM - +263 71 905 3634: Thus ok we will do so fedding to Edoofa scheme keep use posted when to start
8/2/24, 4:34 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, but @263719053634, let me explain you all the benefits and aspects of the Financial Secure Plan. Shall we move ahead? <This message was edited>
9/2/24, 10:27 AM - Dev Edoofa: Good Afternoon @263719053634!
I hope you are doing well. I was expecting a reply from your side yesterday. May I know if we are still connected?
9/2/24, 4:15 PM - +263 71 905 3634: Good Afternoon  sir
9/2/24, 4:15 PM - +263 71 905 3634: Yes we are still connected
9/2/24, 4:17 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am delighted to hear that! May I know if you were able to follow the above conversation that we had yesterday?
9/2/24, 4:36 PM - +263 71 905 3634: Yes l followed it
9/2/24, 4:40 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to see that we are together so far. With this plan for the next 10 months, I am sure you must be wondering what will happen in the next 10 months, considering you have already secured your scholarship seat with the university due to your hard work in the first 10 months. Is my understanding correct?
9/2/24, 4:44 PM - +263 71 905 3634: Yes very correct.
9/2/24, 4:45 PM - Dev Edoofa: Let me help you with that as well. In the 11th month, you will be guided to open an FBC Mastercard bank account in Zimbabwe with a deposit of $150. The reason for this is that when you apply for your student Visa, the Embassy asks for a Bank Statement, and this account will serve that purpose.
9/2/24, 4:45 PM - Dev Edoofa: We understand it might be expensive if you deposit another $1500 for the remaining 10 months in FB  Bank Zimbabwe, so to avoid the same challenges, we have designed the plan accordingly. You will only be depositing for the 11th, 12th, 13th, and 14th month, which is 4 months.
9/2/24, 4:45 PM - Dev Edoofa: Once the 4 months are completed, our Department of Student Welfare (DSW) team will assist you with your visa process. The bank statement will act as one of the required documents, and once you receive the visa, you can withdraw the amount from FBC and book the flight ticket. This will help you utilize the money as well. How does it sound?
9/2/24, 5:09 PM - +263 71 905 3634: It sounds good and well
9/2/24, 5:16 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, from the 16th Month till the 20th month, considering it is a 6-month window, you can again continue depositing the money ($150) with Edoofa which can be used in the fee as and when required or you can decide to save this $900 of these 6 months with you as well. This is something which you are free to choose. I hope you have understood the financial secure plan now?
9/2/24, 6:21 PM - +263 71 905 3634: I understand  dearest

I hope you are doing well and are having a wonderful start to the day. As you know, for the past few days, our team was in Harare, Zimbabwe, for a meet-and-greet seminar attended by more than 1000+ Edoofians over the 3 days. Our visionaries interacted with the students and provided them with clarity on the EWYL sessions, the employment opportunities when students come to India, and the journey of senior Edoofians. The students also got to have one-on-one discussions with our Career Counselor and Admission officer. 
The students had a great time at the seminar and were enthusiastic about grabbing the opportunities that were being presented to them. Let me share some glimpses from the seminar.
