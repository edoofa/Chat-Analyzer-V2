For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts. I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them.

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
18/1/24, 11:53 AM - +263 77 234 8678: I'm ready sir
18/1/24, 12:02 PM - Dev Edoofa: <Media omitted>
18/1/24, 12:03 PM - +263 77 234 8678: Alright sir
18/1/24, 12:05 PM - +263 77 234 8678: I've read it may you go ahead
18/1/24, 12:12 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
18/1/24, 12:12 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
18/1/24, 12:18 PM - +263 77 234 8678: Yes they are very clear
18/1/24, 12:23 PM - Dev Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
18/1/24, 12:23 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
18/1/24, 12:25 PM - +263 77 234 8678: I'm following
18/1/24, 12:30 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process, the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
18/1/24, 12:30 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
18/1/24, 12:32 PM - +263 77 234 8678: Very clear sir
18/1/24, 12:33 PM - +263 77 234 8678: I just wanted to ask ask approximately when would the registration fees due for payment
18/1/24, 12:46 PM - Dev Edoofa: It is to be noted that the registration fee is to be paid after you receive the offer letters. Also currently, our focus is to help you understand the steps you will be taking in your admission journey. As we progress, we will guide you on how university admissions work and how you can select the best one for your higher education.
18/1/24, 12:46 PM - Dev Edoofa: However, engaging in a detailed discussion at this stage may leave you unprepared to comprehend the upcoming steps. Therefore, I encourage you to hold onto any queries you have and follow through with the ongoing discussion, as this is a crucial part of your journey. Once we complete our sessions regarding the next steps, then we will be in a position to discuss such queries I hope you are able to resonate with this perspective, and with that in mind, we can proceed further with our sessions?
18/1/24, 12:52 PM - +263 77 234 8678: Noted
18/1/24, 12:53 PM - +263 77 234 8678: Ailght sir
18/1/24, 12:53 PM - +263 77 234 8678: Alright
18/1/24, 12:57 PM - Dev Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
18/1/24, 12:57 PM - +263 77 234 8678: Yes sir
18/1/24, 12:58 PM - Dev Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
18/1/24, 12:58 PM - Dev Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding until you are ready, shall we start with our discussion with me individually? 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
18/1/24, 1:02 PM - +263 77 234 8678: I'm ready
18/1/24, 1:10 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students*

Founders talk about their decade-long journey of discovering these schools and the experiences that students are having in these schools.

18/1/24, 1:11 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP*

The fourth video is about the Statement of Purpose (SOP). The most important step towards securing a good scholarship is to write the Statement of Purpose but to know why it is important, watching this video will clear your doubts and questions.

18/1/24, 1:12 PM - +263 77 234 8678: That's very true
18/1/24, 1:13 PM - Dev Edoofa: @263772348678 , I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes if you have a smooth internet connection. 

Please go through the 4 videos, our next session will be scheduled after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarize your understanding. Hence, we will connect tomorrow at 12:30 PM to take forward our session.
18/1/24, 1:14 PM - +263 77 234 8678: Alright thank you sir
18/1/24, 1:16 PM - Dev Edoofa: That is wonderful to hear. In that case, we will be concluding the conversation for now and we will reconnect tomorrow at 12:30 pm for our next session. 

I hope by then you will be able to go through the videos. If you have any queries or concerns before then, feel free to share them here in your admission group. Wish you a blessed day ahead and please ensure to extend our regards to your family as well.
18/1/24, 1:17 PM - +263 77 234 8678: Thank you so sir. Have a good day.
18/1/24, 1:26 PM - Dev Edoofa: You are most welcome!
19/1/24, 12:40 PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Anesu!
I hope you are doing well. We have our session right now. May I know if you are ready to take forward our conversation?
19/1/24, 12:41 PM - +263 77 234 8678: Good afternoon sir, yes I'm ready
19/1/24, 12:43 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that and I hope you are excited to take forward Anesu's admission journey.
19/1/24, 12:44 PM - +263 77 234 8678: Yes very much excited
19/1/24, 12:45 PM - Dev Edoofa: Great! Before moving forward, may I know if you were able to watch the 4 videos that were shared with you, yesterday?
19/1/24, 12:45 PM - +263 77 234 8678: Yes I did
19/1/24, 12:46 PM - Dev Edoofa: That is good to know! May I please get to know your understanding of the videos?
19/1/24, 12:50 PM - +263 77 234 8678: From the vedios I got to understand that it is a great privilege to go through Edoofa schoolarship because  the procedure is made quite easy as long as you follow instructions and make up your mind
19/1/24, 12:51 PM - Dev Edoofa: Yes @SEC, that is one way of summarizing the videos. Thank you for sharing your understanding of the videos.
19/1/24, 12:51 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
19/1/24, 12:52 PM - +263 77 234 8678: Yes sir
19/1/24, 12:58 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am delighted to hear that! Now, it is our responsibility to move Anesu's application ahead and help you write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to a Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, Anesu needs to complete the following tasks:
19/1/24, 12:58 PM - Dev Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

https://goo.gl/forms/iWss6zPuOFbnGTXK2
19/1/24, 12:58 PM - Dev Edoofa: 2. I am sharing two documents with you. Kindly go through both documents and submit your responses to the course document here in the group. Make sure you research well before starting the task. All the best!
19/1/24, 12:59 PM - Dev Edoofa: <Media omitted>
19/1/24, 12:59 PM - Dev Edoofa: <Media omitted>
19/1/24, 1:00 PM - Dev Edoofa: Once you share these documents and complete the two tasks that have been provided to you, we will have completed the second step of your university admission process. At that point, we will be prepared to move on to the third step, which involves understanding the registration process.
19/1/24, 1:00 PM - Dev Edoofa: I hope you are clear with these instructions?
19/1/24, 2:52 PM - +263 71 983 6130: Good day to you sir
19/1/24, 2:53 PM - +263 71 983 6130: I wanted to ask when is the above task due
19/1/24, 2:53 PM - +263 71 983 6130: I am currently at school
19/1/24, 5:38 PM - +263 71 983 6130: <Media omitted>
19/1/24, 5:43 PM - +263 71 983 6130: Question 2.
Rights refer to the legal, social, or ethical principles of freedom or entitlement. They are inherent to all human beings and are protected by law. Rights can be categorized into different types such as civil rights, human rights, and legal rights.

Duties, on the other hand, are the moral or legal obligations that individuals are required to fulfill. These obligations are generally imposed by law, ethics, or custom.

The differences between rights and duties are as follows:

1. Nature: Rights are entitlements that individuals possess by virtue of being human, while duties are obligations that individuals are required to fulfill.
2. Focus: Rights focus on the freedom and entitlement of individuals, while duties focus on the responsibilities and obligations of individuals towards others or society.

Human rights are inherent to all human beings, regardless of race, sex, nationality, ethnicity, language, religion, or any other status. They are protected by international law and include rights such as the right to life, liberty, and security of person.

Civil rights, on the other hand, are rights that are granted to individuals within a specific society or country. They are often related to political and social freedom, and examples include the right to vote, the right to a fair trial, and the right to freedom of expression.

Question 3. 
An attorney is a person who is licensed to practice law and represent clients in legal matters. Attorneys can specialize in various areas of law, such as criminal law, civil law, family law, or corporate law. They provide legal advice, prepare legal documents, and represent their clients in court.

A prosecutor, on the other hand, is a type of attorney who represents the government in criminal cases. Prosecutors are responsible for presenting the case against the defendant in court, gathering evidence, examining witnesses, and seeking justice on behalf of the state or government.

The main differences between a prosecutor and an attorney are as follows:

1. Representation: Attorneys represent individual clients, either plaintiffs or defendants, in legal matters. Prosecutors, however, represent the state or government in criminal cases and are responsible for pursuing criminal charges against defendants.

2. Objective: Attorneys generally work to protect the rights and interests of their clients, whether they are individuals, organizations, or businesses. Prosecutors, on the other hand, work to uphold the law and seek justice by representing the government in criminal cases.

3. Role in Court: Attorneys can act as defense lawyers, representing defendants in criminal cases, or as plaintiffs' lawyers, representing individuals or organizations bringing a legal claim. Prosecutors exclusively handle criminal cases and present the state's case against defendants.

Question 4.
I am mostly interested in pursuing Corporate Branch of law 

This is because it allows me as an individual to understand the legal framework within which business operate. This includes governance, finance, and commercial transactions

I have my own personal ambition because, growing up, I witnessed firsthand the injustices and inequalities that many people faced within our legal system. Whether it was due to financial constraints, lack of representation, or societal marginalization, I saw individuals and communities struggling to have their voices heard and their rights upheld, ispecially in businesses operations. 

These experiences fueled my determination to pursue a career in law. I was driven by the belief that everyone deserves equal access to justice and that the law should be a tool for empowerment and positive change. 

This will also give me an upper hand in becoming independent by establishing a law firm. I will also have the ability to give good legal advices ,protect the interest of stakeholders and have the ability to make informed business decisions
   


The above are  the reasons why i would like and justify my interest in studying Corporate law

 Question 5.
I believe, I obtain the following skills which will make me a successful lawyer in the future 

1. I have good research skills.
For example i intend to excel in  most  of the assignments that are handed to me that require research

2. I have good communication skills. I easily interact with people and communicate in a good manner. Most of my conversation with people are positive and productive

3. I am a critical thinker and analyser. Based on  the subject im currently doing for my A Level which are History, Sociology and Biblical studies are Arts subject which require a lot of deep thinking and deep analysis. 

4. I am a good problem solver. This is well justified as i was selected as one of the senior  prefects at first choice private school. This also shows that i have good leadership skills

 In summation I am a person who contains emotional intelligence and empathy and a good timer manager. With the above skills i believe they will make me a successful lawyer.
22/1/24, 6:45 AM - Dev Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Anesu!

I hope that by the time of our session, you will be able to fill out the Statement of Purpose form.

22/1/24, 3:07 PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Ange'lique!

22/1/24, 3:12 PM - +263 77 234 8678: Afternoon sir
22/1/24, 3:12 PM - +263 77 234 8678: Which one is that
22/1/24, 3:13 PM - Dev Edoofa: This one. The Statement Of Purpose.
22/1/24, 3:17 PM - +263 71 983 6130: <Media omitted>

22/1/24, 3:36 PM - Dev Edoofa: However, before we do the same, I was going through your scholarship application file and noticed that you are supposed to make the payment of your remaining part of Edoofa Enrollment fee. Hence, I thought of sharing a gentle reminder with you and trying to understand how your preparation has been so far? Have you been able to align your preparations in the right direction?
23/1/24, 6:14 AM - +263 77 185 2421: Good morning sir.

The balance will be payment before the week ends
23/1/24, 2:17 PM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know! I have taken complete note of it and will update our records team as well.
Before we proceed to the next stage, I'd like to assist you in getting started with your EWYL Journey. Based on your EWYL application form, you are scheduled to commence your EWYL journey Today (23rd January).

24/1/24, 3:31 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that!
24/1/24, 3:34 PM - Dev Edoofa: I was informed by the EWYL team, that you have not joined the EWYL group. I would recommend you to join it as soon as possible.
24/1/24, 3:39 PM - +263 77 234 8678: Will do so
24/1/24, 3:45 PM - +263 77 185 2421: Done
24/1/24, 3:53 PM - Dev Edoofa: That is good to know. Have you introduced yourself on the group?
24/1/24, 4:03 PM - +263 77 185 2421: Yes sir.
24/1/24, 4:46 PM - Dev Edoofa: Great! With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey. we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*.
24/1/24, 4:47 PM - Dev Edoofa: However, before we start the same, I was going through your scholarship application file and noticed that you are supposed to make the payment of your remaining part of Edoofa Enrollment fee. Hence, I thought of sharing a gentle reminder with you and trying to understand how your preparation has been so far? Have you been able to align your preparations in the right direction?
26/1/24, 9:40 AM - Dev Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Anesu!
I hope you are doing well and are having a wonderful start to the day. I felt a bit under the weather yesterday, so I took a day off to focus on my health. Today, I am feeling better and completely ready to take our conversation forward. We will have our session at 3:00 PM to take forward our conversation. May I know if you are going to be available at that time? <This message was edited>
26/1/24, 10:00 AM - +263 77 234 8678: Good morning sir good to know you are feeling better today. I will be partly available since I'm at work I've asked Anesu sister to join in so that we are fully represented
26/1/24, 10:06 AM - +263 77 185 2421: Morning sir. Glad you are feeling better. Noted
26/1/24, 2:31 PM - ~ Phil added +263 71 727 0367
26/1/24, 3:18 PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Afetrnoon Parents and Anesu!
I hope you are doing well. I have taken a note that Anesu's sister will be joining our conversation and I hope to interact with her as well. May I know if you are ready to take forward our conversation?
26/1/24, 3:19 PM - +263 71 727 0367: Good afternoon. Im ready you may go ahead.
26/1/24, 3:32 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that!
26/1/24, 3:33 PM - Dev Edoofa: We have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey. we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*.
26/1/24, 3:33 PM - Dev Edoofa: However, before we start the same, I was going through your scholarship application file and noticed that you are supposed to make the payment of your remaining part of Edoofa Enrollment fee. Hence, I thought of sharing a gentle reminder with you and trying to understand how your preparation has been so far? Have you been able to align your preparations in the right direction?
26/1/24, 3:39 PM - +263 77 185 2421: Yes working on that. By the 11th of February (Stated deadline)  it will be covered without fail
26/1/24, 3:47 PM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. We will reconnect with each other a few days before your due date to take a follow up on this and understand your preparations better,
26/1/24, 3:47 PM - Dev Edoofa: In the meantime. Let us move forward with our discussion. To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is BA LLB and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2025. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
26/1/24, 3:52 PM - +263 77 234 8678: Yes that's correct
26/1/24, 4:01 PM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. Based on our experience of over 14 years and having assisted over 5000 students from different countries, we have realized that financial planning is the most important factor when a student plans for his/her higher education abroad.
26/1/24, 4:01 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am sure that you must be aware that 20-30% of students who are admitted into universities abroad are unable to fulfill their dream and come to India due to a lack of financial planning. The funds needed for booking flights, accommodation, and covering living expenses after arrival often become overwhelming, leading to the decision to defer their admission for a year. This, in turn, creates a gap in the child's education.
26/1/24, 4:01 PM - Dev Edoofa: To assist both students and parents in this regard, Edoofa Management has designed a Financial Secure Plan that aims to help you prepare for your higher educational finances without experiencing stress or last-minute rushes. I believe you must be wondering about the details of the same plan and how it helps the parents?
26/1/24, 4:04 PM - +263 77 185 2421: Yes true
26/1/24, 4:09 PM - Dev Edoofa: Edoofa Secure Plan is important for parents who have children joining the university for tertiary education in the next one to two years for several reasons:
26/1/24, 4:09 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Financial Preparedness:* The Edoofa Secure plan helps parents prepare financially for the costs after the Scholarship being offered so that they are not caught off guard.

*Reduced Financial Stress:* Having the Edoofa Secure Plan in place can significantly reduce the financial stress on you as parents when your child is about to enter university. Knowing that there is a dedicated fund for education expenses provides peace of mind.
26/1/24, 4:09 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Avoiding Debt*: Without proper savings, some parents may resort to taking out loans or accumulating credit card debt to cover their child's education costs. This Educational savings plan helps avoid the burden of debt and high-interest payments.

*Compound Interest:* By starting to save early and consistently contributing to the savings plan, parents can take advantage of compound interest, which can significantly increase the amount available for education expenses.
26/1/24, 4:09 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Flexibility and Control:* The Edoofa Secure savings plans allow parents to have greater control over their finances and how they allocate funds for their child's education. They can choose investment options that align with their risk tolerance and financial goals.

*Encouraging Responsibility*: Involving your child in the process of saving for their education teaches them financial responsibility and the value of higher education. It also motivates them to outperform in Academics.
26/1/24, 4:09 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Adapting to Unexpected Changes*: Life is full of surprises, and circumstances can change especially when there are political reforms changing each day impacting the Local Currency. Having an Edoofa Secure Plan allows parents to adapt to unexpected changes in their financial situation while still prioritizing their child's education.

*Peace of Mind:* Overall, having the Edoofa Secure plan provides parents with peace of mind, knowing that they are actively planning for their child's future and increasing the likelihood of providing them with a solid education.
26/1/24, 4:10 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, when you go through all the above benefits, I am sure you can see that the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan is an important financial tool for parents/students who are supposed to enter the university soon. 

It helps ensure that the financial aspect of tertiary education is well-managed, reduces stress, and allows parents to provide the best opportunities for their children without resorting to debt or financial hardship. Isn't this something you and your family also wish to have?
26/1/24, 4:17 PM - +263 71 727 0367: Yes it is we wish to have that <This message was edited>
26/1/24, 4:27 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through the above points, do you want me to help you understand how the Edoofa Secure Plan works?
26/1/24, 4:32 PM - +263 71 727 0367: Yes please
26/1/24, 4:42 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, as you are aware, we are currently in January 2024, and we have a good 20 months to plan for your finances before you start your university education in 2025.
26/1/24, 4:42 PM - Dev Edoofa: During the counseling session, you were informed that at Edoofa, we guarantee a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship on the tuition fees. Hence, the cost of education, including food and accommodation after the scholarship, would be between $2000-$3000, and it could be even less. Not more than that.
26/1/24, 4:42 PM - Dev Edoofa: This means that if you can save $150 per month for the next 20 months, you will be able to save $3000. This amount is more than enough for the first year of university fees, including tuition fees (if any), food, and accommodation. I hope you agree with this?
26/1/24, 4:43 PM - +263 71 727 0367: Yes we agree
26/1/24, 4:48 PM - +263 77 185 2421: Yaaah that is a good plan
26/1/24, 4:52 PM - Dev Edoofa: Right, this means that by the time you would be in India, you would have already saved the $3000 that will cover the first-year fee.
26/1/24, 4:52 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, in these next 20 months, I am sure you would also be engaged in the EWYL program, and if you secure a minimum of $1000 in 20 months, that means the fees for 1.5 years are already secured.
26/1/24, 4:52 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, for a 3-year course, if we follow the same approach for the remaining 1.5 years, the educational journey for the student and the financial journey for the parent will be easy and smooth. I believe you must be able to see this perspective?
26/1/24, 4:56 PM - +263 77 185 2421: Yes its quite clear
26/1/24, 5:09 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. With that said, there is also another benefit, I am sure being in Zimbabwe you know how drastically the exchange rate fluctuates.
26/1/24, 5:10 PM - Dev Edoofa: If you are buying a dollar today, you might be spending 7000 bonds, but if you buy a dollar after a month, the rate would be different.
26/1/24, 5:10 PM - Dev Edoofa: Also, even if you choose to buy dollars every month and save at your home, it is not safe since there is news of robbery, and mugging every day.
26/1/24, 5:10 PM - Dev Edoofa: In that case, you will opt to save in the Bank, but again we know that savings in the Bank require a Nostro Account which means you have to pay the bank to keep your money safe, right?
26/1/24, 5:22 PM - +263 71 727 0367: Yes
26/1/24, 5:22 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Program Fee (Enrollment Fee) that you were asked to pay is $350. From the $350, you have already paid $200, and the remaining $150 is what you are planning to paybefore your due date of 11 Feb 2024 <This message was edited>
26/1/24, 5:23 PM - Dev Edoofa: Under the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan, a parent has to deposit a small amount of money which is $150 every month for the next 10 months. 

That means, in 10 months, the money saved will be $1500. When this money is saved, Edoofa will waive off the remaining $150 which was due from the Edoofa Program/Enrollment Fee of $350, thereby making a straight saving of $150 in 10 months.
26/1/24, 5:23 PM - Dev Edoofa: Imagine you paying $15 every month to the Bank of Zimbabwe to keep your money safe, and here Edoofa is paying you $15 every month to keep your money safe. Now, you must be wondering, why only for 10 months and not for 20 months, right?
26/1/24, 5:24 PM - +263 71 727 0367: Yes
26/1/24, 5:26 PM - Dev Edoofa: If you see the bigger picture, you will realize that the reason is quite simple. Upon the completion of the 10 installments, the Edoofa Admissions team will initiate the Child’s Admission Process by applying early to the universities to secure their scholarship and their university seat.
26/1/24, 5:26 PM - Dev Edoofa: Reserving seats earlier increases the chances of obtaining a maximum scholarship. A higher scholarship means lower fees, and by securing the seat, you will be entitled to pay the fees as per the old fee structure of the university, not the new one implemented in January 2025. Furthermore, when applying to the universities, you will receive an offer letter or a letter of intent detailing the fees, scholarship, and registration fees.
26/1/24, 5:26 PM - Dev Edoofa: As explained during the enrollment process, the registration fee is a portion of your first-year university fee, paid to reserve the seat. It ranges from $500-$1000 and is not an additional fee. 

From the $1500 you saved with Edoofa, the registration fee will be paid to the university, securing the seat. For instance, if the registration fee is $1000, Edoofa will pay $1000 from the $1500 saved in 10 months. The updated balance with Edoofa will be $500, which will be paid to the university upon your arrival in India.
26/1/24, 5:26 PM - Dev Edoofa: This eases the financial burden on the parent, as there is no immediate payment required upon the student's arrival. The $500 saved will cover the remaining fees for the semester/year, as specified in the offer letter from the university. What are your thoughts on this?
26/1/24, 5:35 PM - +263 71 727 0367: Its a good idea
26/1/24, 5:44 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to see that we are together so far. With this plan for the next 10 months, I am sure you must be wondering what will happen in the next 10 months, considering you have already secured your scholarship seat with the university due to your hard work in the first 10 months. Is my understanding correct?
26/1/24, 5:45 PM - +263 71 727 0367: Yes thats correct
26/1/24, 5:46 PM - Dev Edoofa: Let me help you with that as well. In the 11th month, you will be guided to open an FBC Mastercard bank account in Zimbabwe with a deposit of $150. The reason for this is that when you apply for your student Visa, the Embassy asks for a Bank Statement, and this account will serve that purpose.
26/1/24, 5:46 PM - Dev Edoofa: We understand it might be expensive if you deposit another $1500 for the remaining 10 months in FB  Bank Zimbabwe, so to avoid the same challenges, we have designed the plan accordingly. You will only be depositing for the 11th, 12th, 13th, and 14th month, which is 4 months.
26/1/24, 5:46 PM - Dev Edoofa: Once the 4 months are completed, our Department of Student Welfare (DSW) team will assist you with your visa process. The bank statement will act as one of the required documents, and once you receive the visa, you can withdraw the amount from FBC and book the flight ticket. This will help you utilize the money as well. How does it sound?
26/1/24, 5:47 PM - +263 71 727 0367: It is a good arrangement
26/1/24, 5:53 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, from the 16th Month till the 20th month, considering it is a 6-month window, you can again continue depositing the money ($150) with Edoofa which can be used in the fee as and when required or you can decide to save this $900 of these 6 months with you as well. This is something which you are free to choose. I hope you have understood the financial secure plan now?
26/1/24, 6:05 PM - +263 77 185 2421: Yes well understood
26/1/24, 6:07 PM - Dev Edoofa: That's great. Now that you have all the information, I want you to take some time and discuss the financial security plan with your family members. Help them understand its importance and details. Once you're done, we can reconnect, have a discussion, and address any queries you may have. After resolving your concerns, I'll guide you through starting your financial security plan. 

While most students can discuss this with their parents the same day, I understand everyone is different. Could you let me know when you think you'll have the discussion with your parents? This way, we can schedule our next session accordingly.
26/1/24, 6:08 PM - +263 77 185 2421: Good thing i am 1 of the guardians and i have been part of the discussion
26/1/24, 6:09 PM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. It is great interacting with you.
26/1/24, 6:09 PM - +263 77 185 2421: Thank you
26/1/24, 6:11 PM - Dev Edoofa: You are most welcome! In that case, we will conclude today's conversation, and I will connect with you tomorrow to resume our discussion. In the meantime, I hope you'll have a detailed discussion with your family and jot down any questions or thoughts you have regarding the Financial Secure plan.

Wishing you a good day ahead, and please extend our regards to your family.
26/1/24, 6:24 PM - +263 71 727 0367: Thank you same to you.
26/1/24, 6:25 PM - +263 77 185 2421: Noted thank you
27/1/24, 11:45 AM - Dev Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Anesu!

Please, how are you doing today? With regards to our discussion yesterday, I wanted to reach out and enquire if you are available for us to have a brief conversation?
27/1/24, 1:05 PM - +263 77 234 8678: Sorry Saturday is very tricky for us since we will be at Church
27/1/24, 1:07 PM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know @263772348678. May I know when will you be able to discuss it with your family?
27/1/24, 2:04 PM - +263 77 185 2421: Yes we did discuss it <This message was edited>
27/1/24, 2:05 PM - +263 77 185 2421: It seems to be a great plan and one that wont weigh us down too much financially
27/1/24, 2:06 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that.
27/1/24, 2:07 PM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know, @263771852421 . For the current round of students, there are only 27 seats available for the students who can benefit from the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan. 

Since Anesu has been one of the most dedicated students, and I see he has great aspirations, I wanted him to be a part of the same set of students and start with his future planning the right way.
27/1/24, 2:08 PM - Dev Edoofa: Also, as this plan commences from the month of January, for the efficient implementation of this plan, we need to decide on a fixed date on which you will deposit $150 every month. This will provide you with the flexibility to align your finances accordingly.
27/1/24, 2:08 PM - Dev Edoofa: Our complete focus is on providing students and parents with the best ways to avail themselves of these opportunities. We understand that every parent/ guardian may not be able to make the payment on our specified date. Therefore, considering this situation, we allow them to decide the payment date according to their comfort. In light of the same, may I know the fixed date every month on which you will deposit $150?
27/1/24, 2:09 PM - +263 71 983 6130: Good day sir 
Thank you and all has been noted with great concern
27/1/24, 2:09 PM - +263 77 185 2421: On the specific date will ha e to look into it and provide correct answer on Monday
27/1/24, 2:10 PM - Dev Edoofa: Sure, you can take your time to decide on dates.
27/1/24, 2:20 PM - +263 71 983 6130: Thank you sir
27/1/24, 2:21 PM - Dev Edoofa: You are most welcome!
29/1/24, 3:29 PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Anesu!
I hope you are doing well and had a great weekend. May I know if you were able to decide the fixed date on which you will be making the payment of $150 every month?

29/1/24, 3:40 PM - +263 77 185 2421: Yes the 10th day of every Month
29/1/24, 3:45 PM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know! May I know if you have decided this date to initiate this plan from the month of January, right?
29/1/24, 4:04 PM - +263 77 185 2421: Initial 1st payment will be on the 10th of February

10/2/24, 9:52 AM - Dev Edoofa: Good Morning @263719836130!
I hope you are doing well. You can use the same mode of payment that you used for the payment of the enrollment fee.
10/2/24, 9:55 AM - Dev Edoofa: Also, I noticed that your remaining enrollment of $150 is also left which is due on 11th Feb 2024, i.e. tomorrow. So may I know if you are ready for the preparations for both of the payments?
10/2/24, 10:08 AM - +263 77 185 2421: <Media omitted>
10/2/24, 10:15 AM - Dev Edoofa: Yes, @263771852421. Let me help you with it. The $150 waiver is for the students who are going to follow the plan for the first 9 months, i.e. depositing $150 for the first 9 months. On successful deposition for 9 months, the students will waived off the $150 for the 10th month. I hope you understand?

10/2/24, 12:20 PM - +263 77 185 2421: We had not understood the waiver issue so we had saved up $150 for 1st installment im not sure how we will go about it because we will need a week to save up another $150
10/2/24, 1:51 PM - Dev Edoofa: I understand your situation, @263771852421. I had a conversation with the Academic Board regarding this. You may deposit the other $150 by 17th Feb 2024.
