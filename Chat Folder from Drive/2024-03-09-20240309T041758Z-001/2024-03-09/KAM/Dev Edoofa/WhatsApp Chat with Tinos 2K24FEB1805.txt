8/3/24, 8:23 AM - Dev Edoofa: I hope you are doing well. Thank you for sharing the forms. However, I noticed that in the feedback form the sponsor's details are not mentioned.

Your proactive engagement holds significant weight, and if, for any reason, either you or your guardians won't be available, we kindly request you to inform us beforehand so that we can plan and schedule our discussion beforehand. I hope you have taken note of this as well?
8/3/24, 10:13 AM - +263 78 152 9040: I understand
8/3/24, 10:13 AM - Dev Edoofa: Right, now moving forward, let me brief you that your admissions process and your EWYL program will operate concurrently in the future, therefore you will have two Whatsapp groups to connect with the team:
8/3/24, 10:14 AM - Dev Edoofa: 1. The admissions group *(Tinos 2K24FEB1805)*  will be the platform where we, as your admission officers, will be communicating with you. This group is dedicated to all-important discussions like your university admission process, offer letter discussion, and ultimately your university registration and reservation of your scholarship along with the Visa process. This group will continue to assist you with your admission-related queries while you are here in India.
8/3/24, 10:14 AM - +263 78 152 9040: Okay
8/3/24, 10:14 AM - Dev Edoofa: 2. Earn While You Learn Program *(Tinos EWYL23E1349)* . In this group, your EWYL mentor, head of the department, and head coach will be present. With this group, we will make sure you are prepared to self-finance your education here in India. With your dedicated efforts in the EWYL program, you will earn maximum scholarship credits.

This group will keep a record of the tasks and projects you undertake. You will be provided with the link to the group after the completion of the admission process session and on the dedicated date for your EWYL session, where you will be able to directly speak to your EWYL mentor. I hope you are clear about the purpose of the two groups.
8/3/24, 10:17 AM - +263 78 152 9040: Noted
8/3/24, 10:17 AM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. Moving forward in today's session, we will discuss a bit about your university admission journey. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts. I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them.

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
8/3/24, 10:18 AM - +263 78 152 9040: Well explained
8/3/24, 10:19 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
8/3/24, 10:19 AM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
8/3/24, 10:20 AM - +263 78 152 9040: Yes please
8/3/24, 10:21 AM - +263 78 152 9040: Noted
8/3/24, 10:21 AM - Dev Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps - 

*Step 3: Introduction to the Financial Secure Plan* - Parents with children embarking on their university journey within the next one to two years face important decision-making and rigorous financial planning. Edoofa recognizes the significance of this transition and hence has introduced the Edoofa Secure Plan - a unique and systematic strategy to empower parents in financial planning and preparing for their child's tertiary education well in advance.
8/3/24, 10:21 AM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Scholarship Offer Letter from the university would be issued next year in the month of August.

I hope you are following?
8/3/24, 10:22 AM - +263 78 152 9040: Yes
8/3/24, 10:23 AM - +263 78 152 9040: Am following
8/3/24, 10:25 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. The registration fee will be paid through the savings you have accumulated visa the Financial Secure Plan. After the registration fee is paid, for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
8/3/24, 10:25 AM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
8/3/24, 10:26 AM - +263 78 152 9040: Yes
8/3/24, 10:29 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through all 6 steps, if we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
8/3/24, 10:30 AM - +263 78 152 9040: Yes please
8/3/24, 10:32 AM - Dev Edoofa: This message was deleted

8/3/24, 10:37 AM - Dev Edoofa: The messages were supposed to be sent to someone else, but as I am conversing with many students, there was a genuine mistake from my side. I hope you understand?
8/3/24, 10:38 AM - +263 78 152 9040: I do
8/3/24, 10:39 AM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for understanding. Alright. In the first step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
8/3/24, 10:40 AM - Dev Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding. Until you are ready, shall we start with our discussion with me individually? 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
8/3/24, 10:41 AM - +263 78 152 9040: Yes please
8/3/24, 10:45 AM - Dev Edoofa: *Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students*

This is a video by the founders of EDOOFA, in which they share 2 important qualities of successful Edoofians- who've secured a maximum scholarship and earned scholarship credits.

https://youtu.be/SIh6DcQsqYM
8/3/24, 10:45 AM - Dev Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s vision for you*

This is another video of the founders, where they share the vision of Edoofa at a core level. Founders also talk more about the most important character trait that distinguishes a successful student from the rest of the crowd.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q44qkd4wc7o
8/3/24, 10:45 AM - Dev Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

The third video is about Schools, Colleges, and Universities. I'm sure you're excited to learn more about the schools, colleges, and universities on the Edoofa Platform. Founders talk about their decade-long journey of discovering these schools and the experiences that students are having in these schools.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DW82emflFHw&feature=youtu.be
8/3/24, 10:45 AM - Dev Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP*

The fourth video is about the Statement of Purpose (SOP). The most important step towards securing a good scholarship is to write the Statement of Purpose but to know why it is important, watching this video will clear your doubts and questions.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftsGGGBYMrs&feature=youtu.be
8/3/24, 10:46 AM - Dev Edoofa: I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes if you have a smooth internet connection.

8/3/24, 4:25 PM - +263 78 152 9040: The Edoofa vision is not only to provide students with quality affordable Education but also to prepare them for success in life by helping them to develop skills and mindset necessary to achieve their goals.
8/3/24, 4:25 PM - +263 78 152 9040: Based on the video I learned that students who choose to go through Edoofa are fortunate to be placed in schools that provide adequate accommodation  and support , In contrast some of the agencies may place students in schools that are not equipped to meet their needs leading to unpleasant  experience
8/3/24, 4:25 PM - +263 78 152 9040: I have understood that Edoofa provides an experience that is better than other agency because some agency will not be able to provide the same
8/3/24, 4:27 PM - Dev Edoofa: Brilliant. Thank you for sharing your detailed understanding of the videos. I believe that you were able to feel the essence of videos and able to grasp all the information conveyed.
8/3/24, 4:27 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose. <This message was edited>
8/3/24, 4:28 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by tomorrow before our session.
