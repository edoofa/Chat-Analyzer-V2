28/12/23, 3:10 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, please in that case you can update me by tomorrow. In the meantime let us move ahead with our discussion. Let us now discuss your university admission process. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts. I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them. 

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
28/12/23, 4:11 PM - +263 78 006 5624: Yes we shall start
28/12/23, 4:16 PM - +263 78 006 5624: I have updated the form
28/12/23, 4:17 PM - +263 78 006 5624: <Media omitted>

28/12/23, 5:42 PM - +263 78 006 5624: I had gone through the cycle we can proceed
28/12/23, 6:32 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
28/12/23, 6:32 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
28/12/23, 6:55 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @263780065624 may I know if we are still connected?
28/12/23, 7:41 PM - +263 78 006 5624: Yes l am
28/12/23, 7:43 PM - Kirti Edoofa: so may I know if you are clear so far?
28/12/23, 7:51 PM - +263 78 006 5624: Yes they are clear l got you
28/12/23, 7:56 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
28/12/23, 7:56 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
28/12/23, 8:04 PM - +263 78 006 5624: But if l may ask do you mean that my academic progress determines the university l will study at
28/12/23, 8:10 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for your concern Mercy, let me help you understand as you might be aware, that the Edoofa scholarship program offers *50% to 100%* scholarships. However, to get such a high quantum of scholarship the university has some criteria that the student should have extremely great merits in their A, and O Levels, co-curricular actives, and Edoofa's recommendation too. 

I hope we are clear here?
28/12/23, 8:14 PM - +263 78 006 5624: How will l get the offer letter
28/12/23, 8:32 PM - +263 78 006 5624: Ok l understand so l will know how much percentage  of the scholarship will l get after my A level results are out
28/12/23, 8:32 PM - +263 78 006 5624: <Media omitted>
28/12/23, 8:32 PM - +263 78 006 5624: Here is the online form it was not send by my Email address l used this one tsitsihwanya04@gmail.com
28/12/23, 9:03 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for submitting the student application form, it is duly noted with us.
28/12/23, 9:03 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Please note that this is just a brief understanding of what your admission process holds, you will be explained each and every step in detail as we move forward, I would appreciate you being patient, please.

Now if we are clear shall we move ahead?
28/12/23, 9:36 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I was expecting to hear back from you, but as there hasn't been a response and given that it's been a long day for me, along with the conclusion of our working hours, let's plan to reconnect tomorrow to continue our discussion. I'm optimistic that you'll be able to connect then. Have a great night, and looking forward to our conversation tomorrow.
28/12/23, 9:52 PM - +263 78 006 5624: You are almost welcome
29/12/23, 9:14 AM - +263 78 006 5624: Yes we shall move
29/12/23, 9:15 AM - +263 78 006 5624: Greetings to you can we have the conversation
29/12/23, 12:08 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon parents and Mercy,

I hope this message finds you in good health. In continuation of our earlier conversation, I'm reaching out to check if you are now available to connect with us. Since we were not able to continue with our discussion yesterday?
29/12/23, 12:57 PM - +263 78 006 5624: Yes i'm available we can continue
29/12/23, 1:50 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that we can connect now, so may I know if you are clear so far?
29/12/23, 3:57 PM - +263 78 006 5624: Yes l am clear we can move on
29/12/23, 3:59 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
29/12/23, 3:59 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
29/12/23, 4:26 PM - +263 78 006 5624: I am supposed to pay the registration fee in how many days
29/12/23, 4:38 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @263780065624 yes you are correct as your counselor must have informed you. This registration fee is to be paid by the student/parent to reserve their scholarship seat with the university and it is not an additional cost, it is part of your first-year tuition fee which is paid while you are in your home country and it will be adjusted against your first-year cost of education hence making your registration fee as zero.

I hope we are clear here?
29/12/23, 10:09 PM - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
30/12/23, 5:16 PM - +263 78 006 5624: Ok l get it
30/12/23, 5:24 PM - +263 78 006 5624: Thank you l aso wish you a happy new year
2/1/24, 1:46 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon parents and Mercy,

I hope this message finds you in good health and you had a delightful New Year. With regard to our conversation, I'm reaching out to check if you are now available to connect with us. Doing so will enable us to proceed with our discussion as we had initially intended.
2/1/24, 4:10 PM - +263 78 006 5624: Greetings to you how is 2024
2/1/24, 4:10 PM - +263 78 006 5624: I'm available let's proceed
2/1/24, 4:17 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @263780065624 thank you for asking, 2024 is starting well. I wish the same for you. I am glad to know that we can connect now. If we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
2/1/24, 4:21 PM - +263 78 006 5624: Sure we can
2/1/24, 4:26 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
2/1/24, 4:26 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding you are ready, shall we start with our discussion with me individually
2/1/24, 4:26 PM - Kirti Edoofa: For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
2/1/24, 4:36 PM - +263 78 006 5624: Yes i'm ready let's move forward
2/1/24, 4:47 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, I shall share the videos with you now.
2/1/24, 4:47 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students*

This is a video by the founders of EDOOFA, in which they share 2 important qualities of successful Edoofians- who've secured a maximum scholarship and earned scholarship credits.

https://youtu.be/SIh6DcQsqYM
2/1/24, 4:47 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s vision for you*

This is another video of the founders, where they share the vision of Edoofa at a core level. Founders also talk more about the most important character trait which distinguishes a successful student from the rest of the crowd.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q44qkd4wc7o
2/1/24, 4:47 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

The third video is about Schools, Colleges, and Universities. I'm sure you're excited to learn more about the schools, colleges, and universities on the Edoofa Platform. Founders talk about their decade-long journey of discovering these schools and the experiences which students are having in these schools.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DW82emflFHw&feature=youtu.be
2/1/24, 4:47 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP*

The fourth video is about the Statement of Purpose (SOP). The most important step towards securing a good scholarship is to write the Statement of Purpose but to know why it is important, watching this video will clear your doubts and questions.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftsGGGBYMrs&feature=youtu.be
2/1/24, 4:47 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection. 

Please go through the 4 videos, our next session will be scheduled after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarize your understanding. Hence I would like to know by when you think you will be able to go through these videos so that we can schedule our next session accordingly?
2/1/24, 8:46 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @263780065624 may I know if we are still connected I have been anticipating a response from you?
2/1/24, 8:55 PM - +263 78 006 5624: I need 5 days because network is poor
2/1/24, 9:00 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @263780065624 I understand that network can be a challenge, however, 5 days is a long time. When we started your admission process initially our aim was to complete the process within 4 days, however, due to the delays we have now reached the first step in your admission cycle, with the speed we are moving ahead I am afraid to say this but you are lacking behind your peers, even your EWYL program was not able to commence on the 29th of the delays we had from your end. I would please encourage you to be more proactive as we have a new EWYL batch upcoming on the 9th of January.
2/1/24, 9:21 PM - +263 78 006 5624: Ok l do understand l will try by all means to consume less time
2/1/24, 9:23 PM - +263 78 006 5624: So do you mean that l am not able to get into the EWYL program
2/1/24, 9:25 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @263780065624 you will now have to update the EWYL pledge form with a new date since you missed the opportunity to start your EWYL program early due to delays. The next batch starts on the 9th of January 2024, may I know if you will be able to join that batch?
2/1/24, 9:30 PM - +263 78 006 5624: Yes l will
2/1/24, 9:31 PM - +263 78 006 5624: But l had sent the form on the 28th of December
2/1/24, 9:32 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In that case, you can share the updated EWYL pledge form by tomorrow, you do not need to print a new one you can update the dates on the same.
2/1/24, 9:33 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I understand that, however, we did not complete our admission process within that 4 days timeline that we stated above for your EWYL program to start.
2/1/24, 9:35 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I would love to continue with our discussion, since it's been a long day for me, along with the conclusion of our working hours, let's plan to reconnect tomorrow to continue our discussion. I'm optimistic that you'll be able to connect then. Have a great night, and looking forward to our conversation tomorrow.
2/1/24, 9:37 PM - +263 78 006 5624: Ok l do understand
2/1/24, 9:38 PM - +263 78 006 5624: Ok let's connect tomorrow have a blessed night
3/1/24, 10:16 AM - +263 78 006 5624: Greetings to you , l want to update my EWYL form then which dates should l use
3/1/24, 1:48 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon parents and Mercy,

I hope this message finds you in good health, please do not worry I shall explain the same to you. With regard to our conversation, I'm reaching out to check if you are now available to connect with us. Doing so will enable us to proceed with our discussion as we had initially intended.
3/1/24, 8:39 PM - +263 77 372 4872: Greetings to you I'm available we can connect
3/1/24, 8:58 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @263773724872 I could not help but notice that we have not been able to have a smooth conversation for many days. Since we have informed you about our available hours since the start, let me reiterate them for you.

8/1/24, 9:16 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. Let me share my views as well so that it will help you expand your understanding.

*Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students:* In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. 

You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent.
8/1/24, 9:16 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s vision for you:* Here our founders talk about the most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
8/1/24, 9:16 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program:* Talking about the third video, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
8/1/24, 9:16 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP:* Another thing is that Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based. 

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.

So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by tomorrow 01:30 PM.
8/1/24, 9:31 PM - Kirti Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded.

24/1/24, 1:12 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Mercy,

I trust you're all having a good day. I want to start by apologizing for my absence over the past week. Unfortunately, I was unwell with a severe ENT infection, which required me to rest as per my doctor's advice. Thankfully, I'm feeling much improved now and am eager to reconnect with you so we can continue our discussions. But before we proceed, I'm curious to hear about how your last week went?
24/1/24, 1:16 PM - +263 78 006 5624: Greetings to you, I'm sorry for what you had went through my last week went very well,how are you doing now
25/1/24, 12:07 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Mercy.

I hope you are doing well. Thank you for your concern I am doing better now. With regard to our conversation yesterday since we were not able to move further with our discussion may I know if you are available to connect with us now so that we can continue with our discussion?
25/1/24, 12:41 PM - +263 78 006 5624: Greetings to you, I'm available
25/1/24, 12:41 PM - +263 78 006 5624: The minimum points needed for me to get an Edoofa scholarship is 2 points right
25/1/24, 1:05 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Yes please. In recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their A-Level results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey.
25/1/24, 1:05 PM - Kirti Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?
25/1/24, 1:16 PM - +263 78 006 5624: I have 4 points
25/1/24, 1:18 PM - +263 78 006 5624: Here are the symptom
Biology C
Chemistry E
Maths O 
In total they are 4 points
25/1/24, 1:45 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @263780065624 Thank you for sharing that, please share the picture of the result as well.
25/1/24, 1:49 PM - +263 78 006 5624: I have not yet collected my results at school
25/1/24, 1:54 PM - Kirti Edoofa: It is alright please, in that case, please share the screenshot of the result from the portal?
25/1/24, 2:04 PM - +263 78 006 5624: Someone else opened my results on the portal so I didn't get a chance of viewing them but I'm sure that l will collect them from school very soon
25/1/24, 2:04 PM - +263 78 006 5624: But will l have a chance of getting the scholarship with my results
25/1/24, 2:05 PM - +263 78 006 5624: Please do me a favor so that l get the scholarship
25/1/24, 4:56 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @263780065624 it is alright please yes please Mercy you will surely be able to get a scholarship however, your application was shared for the higher quantum of scholarship, and since your result is not really good in one particular subject so I would like to know what challenges did you faced in your examinations?
25/1/24, 5:36 PM - +263 78 006 5624: As for maths ,we did not have enough lessons since our maths teacher was also a sports master for the school so much of his time he had been directing sports activities so the syllabus was  no able to be completed and also we started our A level in the second term in May due to COVID-19 so it was hard for us to finish up
25/1/24, 7:54 PM - Kirti Edoofa: It sounds like you faced some significant challenges during your A-level mathematics course. Having limited lessons because your math teacher was also committed to sports activities definitely made it difficult for you to cover the entire syllabus. Additionally, the delayed start of your A-levels in May, due to COVID-19, added to these challenges by compressing the time available to complete your coursework.
25/1/24, 7:55 PM - Kirti Edoofa: It's important to remember that everyone faces setbacks at some point. What matters most is how we respond to them. This is an opportunity for growth and learning. Reflect on the experience, identify areas for improvement, and use this as a stepping stone towards future successes.
25/1/24, 7:55 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Rest assured, that you have Edoofa’s full support in navigating this phase. Whether it's discussing options for retaking the exam, exploring alternative career paths, or just needing someone to guide you, we are here for you.
25/1/24, 7:57 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Since your application was selected for a higher quantum of scholarship because of the one subject it may not be possible for you to secure a higher quantum however, stay assured that you are eligible for a scholarship through Edoofa.
25/1/24, 8:13 PM - +263 78 006 5624: So am l still eligible for the Edoofa scholarship
25/1/24, 8:13 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @263780065624 yes please you are absolutely correct.
25/1/24, 8:14 PM - +263 78 006 5624: So am l going to start my university in August under Edoofa scholarship
25/1/24, 8:17 PM - +263 78 006 5624: Please make me happy, achieve my goals by only saying yes
25/1/24, 8:29 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, that is absolutely correct. Of course, it is our aim as well to help you achieve your goals and for that let us now shift our mind towards the admission process.
25/1/24, 8:29 PM - +263 78 006 5624: Ok thank you
25/1/24, 8:33 PM - Kirti Edoofa: So may I know by when will you be able to complete these academic interview questions?
25/1/24, 8:37 PM - +263 78 006 5624: Can you please resend me the questions please do me a favor my WhatsApp expired so I lost the pdf

25/1/24, 8:48 PM - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome, it is alright please in that case, let us reconnect tomorrow once you are done with the academic interview questions. I hope you do not delay the process any more.
25/1/24, 8:49 PM - +263 78 006 5624: Ok thanks have a good night
29/1/24, 5:11 AM - +263 78 006 5624: 3.What is good laboratory practice and why is it followed in the Lab

Techniques used for placing samples under a microscope includes Dry mount where a specimen is placed on a slide with or without a cover slipover it.This method is useful for viewing dry specimens such as hair and pollen. The other one is wet mount where a specimen is placed on a drop of water especially distilled water on the slide with a cover slip placed over it. This is often used for viewing cells. Other techniques include the following, place your sample on the stage and turn on the LED light. Look through the eyepieces and move the focus knob until the image comes into focus. Adjust the distance between the eyepieces until you can see the sample clearly with both eyes simultaneously. Inorder to accurately look at specimens under a microscope,you must first need to learn how to properly prepare a wet mount.A wet mount is made by placing a fluid solution on a slide, suspending a specimen in a solution, and the covering the specimen and the solution with a cover slide

6/2/24, 1:27 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Mercy.

I hope you are doing well. Thank you for sharing the academic interview questions, it is duly noted with us. May I know if you are available to connect with us now so that we can move forward with our discussion?
6/2/24, 1:27 PM - +263 78 006 5624: Good afternoon how are you,yes I'm ready
6/2/24, 2:06 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for asking, I am doing great. *Now with this, we have completed the second step of your university admission cycle, and hence we will move forward to the third step in your admission journey.*
6/2/24, 2:06 PM - Kirti Edoofa: To be on the same page, If I am correct, I believe you want to pursue a bachelor's degree in the course B.Sc (Medical Lab Technology) for your higher education in India as per the August 2024 intake?
6/2/24, 2:09 PM - +263 78 006 5624: Yes you are correct
6/2/24, 2:12 PM - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
6/2/24, 2:13 PM - +263 78 006 5624: Yes I'm ready
6/2/24, 2:14 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
6/2/24, 2:14 PM - Kirti Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
6/2/24, 2:14 PM - Kirti Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
6/2/24, 2:14 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
6/2/24, 2:20 PM - +263 78 006 5624: Yes l do understand
6/2/24, 2:21 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
6/2/24, 2:21 PM - Kirti Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $1000. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
6/2/24, 2:21 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
6/2/24, 8:47 PM - +263 78 006 5624: Yes we discussed about it
6/2/24, 9:19 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $1200 to $1800 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
7/2/24, 2:38 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon parents and Mercy,

I trust you're well. I'm following up regarding the message I shared with you above. I was expecting a reply, but it seems my messages might not have been received.

Therefore, I'm reaching out today to check if you had a chance to review my previous message and to confirm if we are still in communication?
8/2/24, 6:38 AM - +263 78 006 5624: Yes we are
8/2/24, 6:39 AM - +263 78 006 5624: I'm aware of it
8/2/24, 12:12 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon parents and Mercy,

I trust you're well. I'm following up regarding the message I shared with you above. I was expecting a reply earlier. However, since we were not able to connect and continue with our discussion may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
8/2/24, 12:50 PM - +263 78 006 5624: Yes I'm available
8/2/24, 12:51 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that, so may I know if you are clear so far?
8/2/24, 12:52 PM - +263 78 006 5624: Yes l am
8/2/24, 12:57 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:
8/2/24, 12:57 PM - Kirti Edoofa: 1. *Tuition Fee*: $650 per annum
2. *Accommodation Fee*: $0 per annum (100% Sponsorship)
3. *Remaining Fee Components*: [Library Fee, Examination Fee, EDB and Book Bank, International Student Development Fund, 24-Hour WiFi Cost, Maintenance Fee, Water Bill, and Electricity Bill]: $1000 per annum

*Total Fee: Tuition Fee $650 + Accommodation Fee $0 + Remaining Fee Components $1000 = $1650 per annum.*

Registration Fee to be paid: $1000 (deadline within two weeks of issue of the offer letter, part of the university’s first-year fee and will be adjusted against the first-year cost of education $1650). I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?
8/2/24, 1:01 PM - +263 78 006 5624: Waal interesting l get it
8/2/24, 1:14 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $1000, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $1000 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $1650 as per the above example. Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $1650 - $1000 = $650. This amount can be paid within the first three days of your arrival in India.
8/2/24, 1:20 PM - +263 78 006 5624: Oooh ok
8/2/24, 1:21 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
8/2/24, 1:21 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
8/2/24, 1:21 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
8/2/24, 7:24 PM - +263 78 006 5624: Ok I get it
8/2/24, 7:25 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
8/2/24, 7:28 PM - +263 78 006 5624: How will l get the administration later
8/2/24, 7:34 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @263780065624 we will be sharing your application with the universities and then when we will receive any update we shall notify you.
8/2/24, 7:38 PM - +263 78 006 5624: Oooh ok l get you
8/2/24, 7:45 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now with this, we are done with step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
8/2/24, 7:46 PM - Kirti Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one.
8/2/24, 7:46 PM - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
8/2/24, 8:15 PM - +263 78 006 5624: Of course we are excited to receive the letter
8/2/24, 8:15 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received special news for the students of the 2024 admission intake. May I know if you are excited to know the news we have for you?
8/2/24, 8:16 PM - +263 78 006 5624: Ok thanks to you
8/2/24, 8:16 PM - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. Please let me know if you were able to go through my message above. <This message was edited>
8/2/24, 8:17 PM - +263 78 006 5624: Waal this is interesting
8/2/24, 8:17 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Indeed. The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
8/2/24, 8:17 PM - Kirti Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.
8/2/24, 8:17 PM - +263 78 006 5624: Yes l am excited
8/2/24, 8:18 PM - +263 78 006 5624: Yes l was able
8/2/24, 8:19 PM - +263 78 006 5624: Thanks to you
8/2/24, 8:19 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. After speaking with thousands of students and parents who completed their admission process before you, we realized that the current economic situation in African countries makes it a bit challenging for parents to pay the full registration fee at once. 

In response to the same challenge, we had a detailed discussion with the academic board and university official. As a result, we developed a solution to alleviate the financial burden of the parents specifically for the registration fee due of $500 to $1000.
8/2/24, 8:19 PM - Kirti Edoofa: We at Edoofa are thrilled about this development, and I believe it will significantly help all of our students and their families. Are you aware of the solution?
8/2/24, 8:20 PM - +263 78 006 5624: I didn't understand this well
8/2/24, 8:21 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright, let me share the same. With respect to the conversation we had with the academic board and the university officials, we requested them to allow the students to make the payment of their registration fee in two parts within a span of 45 days thereby reducing the financial pressure.
8/2/24, 8:21 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: Consider that your registration fee is $1000. After you will receive the offer letter, the first part of the registration fees which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, i.e. $500 needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university (For most of the universities 15 days). Subsequently, the second part of $500, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
8/2/24, 8:21 PM - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for February 15, 2024, and your registration fee stands at $1000, you'll need to make a payment of $500 on or before February 15, 2024. The remaining $500 should be paid by March 15, 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
8/2/24, 8:31 PM - +263 78 006 5624: Ok I understood
8/2/24, 8:37 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. As your guardian, I am sure your parents are excited to initiate the process? For the current round of admissions, only 31 scholarship seats are available and hence let us begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the payment plan offered for the registration fee. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
8/2/24, 8:38 PM - +263 78 006 5624: Yes I'm very excited
8/2/24, 8:39 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to *evaluate your application* after which if they accept your application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
8/2/24, 8:44 PM - +263 78 006 5624: It's ok l will be waiting
