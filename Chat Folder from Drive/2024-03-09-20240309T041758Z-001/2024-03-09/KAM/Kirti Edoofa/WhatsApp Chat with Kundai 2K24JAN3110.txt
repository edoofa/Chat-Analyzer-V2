It's impressive to hear about your elder son, Kudakwashe, pursuing his first-year degree in HR management at MSU in Zimbabwe.

The fact that both you and your wife, Ms. Dorothy, are actively involved in supporting your children's education, despite being in different locations, speaks volumes about your dedication as parents.
1/3/24, 1:13 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Moving forward, I would like to bring an important aspect to your attention. The collective aim that we have for the student strongly values balanced involvement from parents, especially when the student is unable to participate. Your proactive engagement holds significant weight, and if, for any reason, either you or your guardians won't be available, we kindly request you to inform us beforehand so that we can plan and schedule our discussion beforehand. I hope you have taken note of this as well?
1/3/24, 1:15 PM - +263 77 463 0093: I will advise later today ,if both of them can join.
I'm sure they each will pickup the conversations done so far and have their input once they go through
1/3/24, 1:16 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Fantastic! Now over the next four days, our focus as your admission team will be on equipping you with a comprehensive understanding of what lies ahead in your university admission journey and help you commence the same.
1/3/24, 1:16 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Soon after, we will guide you through the initiation of your EWYL Journey. The next batch of EWYL Sessions is scheduled to commence on Friday (February 8th) and hence, if we are able to focus and complete the Admission Process before Friday with pure consistency, you will be able to start your EWYL journey as well in a timely manner.
1/3/24, 1:16 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Kindly mark this date on your calendar and ensure that you are available to complete the necessary procedures within the stipulated timeline. If everything is proceeding as planned so far, shall we move forward and begin our session for the day?
1/3/24, 1:22 PM - +263 77 463 0093: Noted
1/3/24, 1:23 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Right, now moving forward, let me brief you that your admissions process and your EWYL program will operate concurrently in the future, therefore you will have two Whatsapp groups to connect with the team:
1/3/24, 1:23 PM - Kirti Edoofa: 1. The admissions group *(Kundai 2K24JAN3110)*  will be the platform where we, as your admission officers, will be communicating with you. This group is dedicated to all-important discussions like your university admission process, offer letter discussion, and ultimately your university registration and reservation of your scholarship along with the Visa process. This group will continue to assist you with your admission-related queries while you are here in India.
1/3/24, 1:24 PM - Kirti Edoofa: 2. Earn While You Learn Program *(Kundai EWYL23E1298)*. In this group, your EWYL mentor, head of the department, and head coach will be present. With this group, we will make sure you are prepared to self-finance your education here in India. With your dedicated efforts in the EWYL program, you will earn maximum scholarship credits.

This group will keep a record of the tasks and projects you undertake. You will be provided with the link to the group after the completion of the admission process session and on the dedicated date for your EWYL session, where you will be able to directly speak to your EWYL mentor. I hope you are clear about the purpose of the two groups.
1/3/24, 2:45 PM - +263 77 463 0093: As a parent ,I am clear
1/3/24, 2:46 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that you are clear about the purpose of the two WhatsApp groups and it's reassuring to hear this from your end. I also had a recent conversation with your counselor, during which he provided me with some insights into Kundai's academic background and career aspirations. I must commend you as a family, you must take great pride in his achievements and be dedicated to ensuring his access to the finest opportunities to launch his career.

Speaking of valuable opportunities, I am also curious to learn more about your counseling session with your counselor and to understand which aspects of the Edoofa Scholarship Program have particularly impressed you thus far. Can you share this with me?
1/3/24, 3:22 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @263774630093 may I know if we are still connected?
1/3/24, 7:17 PM - +263 77 463 0093: Sorry for the breakdown, 
Well what impressed me more was the idea of earning some points that will have a positive effect towards the bills and being an anchor towards a reduction in what we are to fork out towards his studies.
In addition to this he will also gain hands on and work related experience as he progresses with the program.
Thirdly ,he will be exposed to the world hence there  are more chances of doing better in life.
This also prepares him to stand alone ,and not depend on other people to include me as a parent .
Creates some form of independence towards his future
1/3/24, 8:43 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am delighted to know that you had such a great experience! I am glad to know that you have a great understanding of the EWYL program and absolutely through EWYL students get to learn more about 21st-century skills that are necessary for today's world to be employable.

4/3/24, 9:24 AM - Kirti Edoofa: It is alright please, if you are available right now we can connect right now as well.
4/3/24, 9:51 AM - +263 77 463 0093: Fine let's do
4/3/24, 10:08 AM - Kirti Edoofa: That is great. Let us now discuss your university admission process. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts. I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them. 

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
4/3/24, 10:10 AM - +263 77 463 0093: Yes
4/3/24, 10:11 AM - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
4/3/24, 10:11 AM - +263 77 463 0093: Let's continue
4/3/24, 10:13 AM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
4/3/24, 10:13 AM - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
4/3/24, 10:15 AM - +263 77 463 0093: Yes
4/3/24, 10:16 AM - +263 77 463 0093: And this is from Kundai right
4/3/24, 10:17 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please.
4/3/24, 10:17 AM - +263 77 463 0093: Ok
4/3/24, 10:17 AM - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
4/3/24, 10:17 AM - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
4/3/24, 10:17 AM - +263 77 463 0093: Yes
4/3/24, 10:18 AM - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process, the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
4/3/24, 10:18 AM - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
4/3/24, 10:20 AM - +263 77 463 0093: How is this fee paid ,is it through the same FBC bank locally
4/3/24, 10:21 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please. Also, this is just a brief understanding of what your admission process holds, you will be explained each and every step in detail as we move forward, I would appreciate you being patient, please.

Now if we are clear shall we move ahead?
4/3/24, 10:22 AM - +263 77 463 0093: Yes
4/3/24, 10:22 AM - Kirti Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
4/3/24, 10:22 AM - +263 77 463 0093: Yes
4/3/24, 10:23 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
4/3/24, 10:23 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding until you are ready, shall we start with our discussion with me individually?
4/3/24, 10:24 AM - +263 77 463 0093: Yes

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftsGGGBYMrs&feature=youtu.be
4/3/24, 10:26 AM - Kirti Edoofa: I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection. 

Please go through the 4 videos, our next session will be scheduled after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarize your understanding. Hence I would like to know by when you think you will be able to go through these videos so that we can schedule our next session accordingly?
4/3/24, 11:18 AM - +263 77 463 0093: Noted, I personally have learned about Edoofa offering world opportunities to its students ,who have to follow protocols and procedures .and students should have open minds to explore and venture.
Learned about pathways to success.
Endoofa s responsibilities for suitable colleges and universities for international students which have a good reputation.
Vibrant culture at these institutions .
Also about SOP from the students to justify their enrollment.
Meanwhile I will Wai for Kundai s input once he gets a chance to go through the above.
Then can engage in the next step
4/3/24, 11:22 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. Let me share my views as well so that it will help you expand your understanding.

*Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students:* In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. 

You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent.
4/3/24, 11:22 AM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s vision for you:* Here our founders talk about the most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
4/3/24, 11:22 AM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program:* Talking about the third video, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
4/3/24, 11:22 AM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP:* Another thing is that Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based. 

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
4/3/24, 11:24 AM - +263 77 463 0093: Noted Thank you

4/3/24, 11:26 AM - +263 77 463 0093: Yes,

6/3/24, 11:24 AM - +263 71 210 3464: <Media omitted>
6/3/24, 11:30 AM - +263 71 210 3464: 2.

The process of setting up a business is known as "entrepreneurship". Entrepreneurship  is therefore when an entrepreneur invests time money and effort and also risking these time money and efforts to start a business venture and make it successful. 

Economic development is programs, policies or activities that seek to improve the economic well-being and quality of life for a community. What “economic development” means to you will depend on the community you live in. Each community has its own
6/3/24, 11:36 AM - +263 71 210 3464: 3.

My understanding towards the abbreviation GAAP is that it involves accounting principles or standards used to govern how an organization operates for financial reporting mainly.
A good example of GAAP is the financial statements of a balance sheet whereas a company provides a yearly or any convenient time period statement disclosing the respective time period for assets ,liabilities ,revenue, sales, expenses and changes in equity for the company.

These standards are usually used in accordance to allow reference and consistency.
6/3/24, 11:42 AM - +263 71 210 3464: 4.

Accounting standards are authoritative standards for financial reporting and are the primary source of generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Accounting standards specify how transactions and other events are to be recognized, measured, presented and disclosed in financial forms.

So Accounting standards are termed IAS and range and differentiated by numbers . My understanding on some of the Accounting standard is IAS 16 PROPERTY PLANT AND EQUIPMENT whereas all properties plants and equipment used by the business are called assets and recording of their depreciation , carrying amount and also recoverable amounts are governed and used in a way that can be used internationally by many other companies to allow for future references.

This is where the main point is brought out and the reason why accounting standards are mandatory to organisations across the world
6/3/24, 11:45 AM - +263 71 210 3464: 5.


Accounting is a process whereby companies are recording, analysing , reporting and keeping transactions records in business ventures. It also involves keeping track of all financial transactions within a business venture such as cash inflow and outflows. It is important  for record keeping and business management.
6/3/24, 11:47 AM - +263 71 210 3464: Whereas 

Auditing is defined as an insight verification process which might include examination or investigation into certain details to provide coherence with supplied details and ensure compliance to requirements
6/3/24, 11:50 AM - +263 71 210 3464: <Media omitted>

7/3/24, 2:08 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for submitting your SOP, and the academic interview questions. It is well noted with us, and we have shared the same with the admissions team as well. They will now evaluate your response and will proceed to work on it so that your university application is well prepared.
7/3/24, 2:09 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Now with this, we have completed the second step of your university admission cycle, and hence we will move forward to the third step in your admission journey.*
7/3/24, 2:09 PM - +263 77 463 0093: U are welcome
7/3/24, 2:09 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Before we move ahead. I was going through your scholarship application file and noticed that you are supposed to make the payment of your remaining part of Edoofa Enrollment fee before 10th March 2024. Hence, I thought of sharing a gentle reminder with you and try to understand how your preparation has been so far? Have you been able to align your preparations in the right direction?
7/3/24, 2:11 PM - +263 77 463 0093: Will definitely
7/3/24, 2:14 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. We will reconnect with each other a few days before your due date to take a follow up on this and understand your preparations better.
7/3/24, 2:14 PM - Kirti Edoofa: To be on the same page, If I am correct, I believe you want to pursue a bachelor's degree in the course BCom for your higher education in India as per the August 2024 intake?
7/3/24, 2:25 PM - +263 77 463 0093: True, the long end result is to persue ACTUARIAL SCIENCE soon after the first degree.
So was convinced that s the path way
7/3/24, 2:45 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation. Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission* Are you ready to start with that?
7/3/24, 2:56 PM - +263 77 463 0093: I guess this requires Kundai to be on the forefront, whilst we follow, I m sure once he is on a good network in Zim ,he will come in
7/3/24, 3:11 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am sure Kundai will be able to follow through with the conversation once he is connected to a stable network. In the meantime, we can connect and move forward with our discussion.
7/3/24, 3:26 PM - +263 77 463 0093: Noted
7/3/24, 3:28 PM - +263 77 463 0093: He is at a part time work where some restrictions on use of phones except at break and lunch time
7/3/24, 3:29 PM - Kirti Edoofa: It is alright, please. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
7/3/24, 3:29 PM - Kirti Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
7/3/24, 3:29 PM - Kirti Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
7/3/24, 3:29 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
7/3/24, 3:30 PM - +263 77 463 0093: Yes
7/3/24, 3:31 PM - +263 77 463 0093: I agree
7/3/24, 3:41 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
7/3/24, 3:41 PM - Kirti Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $1000. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
7/3/24, 3:41 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
7/3/24, 3:45 PM - +263 77 463 0093: Yes
7/3/24, 3:45 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $1200to $1800 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page? <This message was edited>
7/3/24, 3:46 PM - +263 77 463 0093: Correct
7/3/24, 3:47 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:
7/3/24, 3:47 PM - Kirti Edoofa: 1. *Tuition Fee*: $650 per annum
2. *Accommodation Fee*: $0 per annum (100% Sponsorship)
3. *Remaining Fee Components*: [Library Fee, Examination Fee, EDB and Book Bank, International Student Development Fund, 24-Hour WiFi Cost, Maintenance Fee, Water Bill, and Electricity Bill]: $1000 per annum

*Total Fee: Tuition Fee $650 + Accommodation Fee $0 + Remaining Fee Components $1000 = $1650 per annum.* <This message was edited>
7/3/24, 3:48 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Registration Fee to be paid: $1000 (deadline within two weeks of issue of the offer letter, part of the university’s first-year fee and will be adjusted against the first-year cost of education $1650). I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?
7/3/24, 3:53 PM - +263 77 463 0093: Yes
7/3/24, 3:56 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $1000, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $1000 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $1650 as per the above example. Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $1650- $1000 = $650. This amount can be paid within the first three days of your arrival in India.
7/3/24, 3:57 PM - +263 77 463 0093: Noted
7/3/24, 3:58 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
7/3/24, 3:59 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
7/3/24, 3:59 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
7/3/24, 4:01 PM - +263 77 463 0093: I follow
7/3/24, 4:02 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
7/3/24, 4:03 PM - +263 77 463 0093: No question so far ,you can proceed
7/3/24, 4:05 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, Now with this, we are done with step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
7/3/24, 4:05 PM - Kirti Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one.
7/3/24, 4:06 PM - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
7/3/24, 4:08 PM - +263 77 463 0093: Noted , will be grateful to receive
7/3/24, 4:24 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received special news for the students of the 2024 admission intake. May I know if you are excited to know the news we have for you?
7/3/24, 5:04 PM - +263 77 463 0093: Ply
7/3/24, 5:04 PM - +263 77 463 0093: Please
8/3/24, 7:55 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Kundai.

I hope you are doing well. By the time you responded yesterday, it was past our available hours so we could not get back to you, however, we are available now, and we can connect today.
8/3/24, 9:45 AM - +263 77 463 0093: Good morning Kirti
8/3/24, 11:04 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
8/3/24, 11:06 AM - +263 77 463 0093: Yes now
8/3/24, 11:07 AM - Kirti Edoofa: That is good to know. After speaking with thousands of students and parents who completed their admission process before you, we realized that the current economic situation in African countries makes it a bit challenging for parents to pay the full registration fee at once. 

In response to the same challenge, we had a detailed discussion with the academic board and university official. As a result, we developed a solution to alleviate the financial burden of the parents specifically for the registration fee due of $500 to $1000.
8/3/24, 11:07 AM - Kirti Edoofa: We at Edoofa are thrilled about this development, and I believe it will significantly help all of our students and their families. Are you aware of the solution?
8/3/24, 11:13 AM - +263 77 463 0093: I wasn't aware, that's good news
I'm I getting this right on the last statement reading alleviate the financial burden of the parents specifically for the registration fee due of $500 to $1000. 
Is it not vise versa like of $1000 to $500
8/3/24, 11:19 AM - Kirti Edoofa: I am not able to understand your question better here, could you please help me understand your question better?
8/3/24, 11:22 AM - +263 77 463 0093: I mean is registration fee now $500 from $1000 or now $1000 from $500
To justify alleviation of financial burden of parents
8/3/24, 11:27 AM - Kirti Edoofa: @263774630093 the registration fee ranges from $500- $1000, however, we always make sure that you as parents prepare for $1000 in mind, so that if the amount in left it can used in future preparations. I hope you have a better understanding now?
8/3/24, 11:29 AM - +263 77 463 0093: Noted
8/3/24, 11:33 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Yes please, now with respect to the conversation we had with the academic board and the university officials, we requested them to allow the students to make the payment of their registration fee in two parts within a span of 45 days thereby reducing the financial pressure.
8/3/24, 11:33 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: Consider that your registration fee is $1000. After you will receive the offer letter, the first part of the registration fees which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, i.e. $500 needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university (For most of the universities 15 days). Subsequently, the second part of $500, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
8/3/24, 11:33 AM - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for March 15, 2024, and your registration fee stands at $1000, you'll need to make a payment of $500 on or before March 15, 2024. The remaining $500 should be paid by April 15, 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?

8/3/24, 11:36 AM - Kirti Edoofa: That is good to know. As Kundai's guardian, are you excited to initiate the process? For the current round of admissions, only 31 scholarship seats are available and hence let us begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the payment plan offered for the registration fee. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
8/3/24, 11:43 AM - +263 77 463 0093: Yes
8/3/24, 12:22 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to *evaluate their application* after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
