16/1/24, 9:54 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Samantha,

I trust this message finds you well. I am *Ms. Kirti, the Admission Officer at Edoofa*. I will be handling the next steps in your university admission journey and will be directing you in the right direction. As we step into the second week of January, I wanted to reach out and share an exciting milestone that India as a country achieved within the first week of 2024 - the successful India's Chandrayaan-3 Engine Test.
16/1/24, 9:54 AM - Kirti Edoofa: This accomplishment is responsible for the third lunar mission, aiming to land a rover on the Moon's south polar region and conduct scientific studies that could check Moon's viability to sustain life. It signifies a significant scientific advancement, laying the groundwork for future progress.
16/1/24, 9:54 AM - Kirti Edoofa: This achievement has not only pushed boundaries but also inspired young minds all over the world to pursue their dreams. On the same note, I wanted to extend my heartiest wishes for the New Year to you and your family and check in to see how you and your family started your year?
16/1/24, 10:05 AM - +263 71 335 7360: Hello Ms Kirti how are you?
16/1/24, 10:05 AM - +263 71 335 7360: Here we are all well and we have started off the  year of 2024 very well and how is it to your side?

17/1/24, 7:47 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Samantha.

I hope you are doing well. Thank you for asking, I am doing great. I am glad to know that you started your year very well. Mine was great as well. With great excitement and pride, I also want to share that over the past few days, the Edoofa team has been immersed in an exciting event we had in store for our students. Edoofa hosted a conference - the Symposium of Leaders, Innovators, and Creators at Edoofa, also known as 'SLICE-CON.'
17/1/24, 7:47 AM - Kirti Edoofa: The conference was attended by all the Edoofians of 2023 and a few senior Edoofians from previous batches. It focused on the art of creation, innovation, and, most importantly, the mindset required to make an impact in one's career.
17/1/24, 7:47 AM - Kirti Edoofa: During this Industrial Visit and the conference - SLICE CON, Corporate leaders, such as the CEOs and Co-founders from renowned companies like Rage Coffee, Sirona Hygiene, Jolin New York, and more, shared their insights and experiences. These individuals are at the helm of multi-millionaire brands, leading large marketing teams. Their presence added immense value, providing students with the opportunity to engage in transformative conversations.
17/1/24, 7:47 AM - Kirti Edoofa: We believe that interactions with such industry leaders can bring significant transformations to students' lives, enhancing their business acumen. Our Edoofians maximized this opportunity, having life-changing conversations with these influential figures. The main objective of the event was to emphasize the importance of thinking outside the box, and encouraging students to believe in themselves and their dreams. Before we discuss your admission journey further, I wanted to share a glimpse of the event, and I hope you are excited to attend similar events when you come to India.

I hope you are doing well. Thank you for asking, I am doing great. You are most welcome and I am glad to know that you are doing well. Over the past couple of days, we also had the pleasure of conversing with some of our students who expressed their joy upon receiving their A-Level results.

Reflecting on my own school days, I vividly recall the mix of excitement and anticipation surrounding the result day. It is an important moment that shapes the path of one’s academic journey.
17/1/24, 9:38 AM - Kirti Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?
17/1/24, 10:25 PM - +263 71 335 7360: Alright let me share with you

I trust this message finds you in good health. I am *Ms. Kirti, the Admission officer at Edoofa.*  Today while I was organizing my day, I was going through our records, and I came across your scholarship application and noticed that you were one of the dedicated students who was so keen on pursuing your education abroad.

Hence, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out personally and just check in with you and your family. How have you been doing? Were you able to start your higher education by now, or are you still exploring better opportunities?

It is alright please, do not be disheartened, you did your best and we are proud of you.
4/3/24, 9:47 AM - +263 71 335 7360: Thank you for understanding please

4/3/24, 9:52 AM - +263 71 335 7360: Im concerned about my journey with Edoofa.
4/3/24, 10:09 AM - Kirti Edoofa: May I know what happened, and why do you think in such a way?
4/3/24, 10:40 AM - +263 71 335 7360: My parents are farmers as i have told you before so its unfortunate that this year the farming season was seriously disturbed by low rainfall so they expected great harvests but it turned out to a loss
4/3/24, 12:20 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I'm truly sorry to hear about the challenges your parents are facing with the farming season this year. It's disheartening when unexpected factors like low rainfall disrupt what was anticipated to be a fruitful harvest, turning it into a loss. Agriculture is greatly dependent on weather conditions, and such uncertainties can have profound effects. However, could you please help elaborate on how you are concerned about your journey with us here?
4/3/24, 12:22 PM - +263 71 335 7360: We were looking foward to complete the Admission fee after harvesting so this draw back has affected my education as well.
6/3/24, 1:49 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Samantha.

I hope you are doing well. Kindly excuse me for not connecting with you earlier, as I was occupied with work that required my immediate attention, however, I am available to connect with you now.
6/3/24, 1:50 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Coming back to the concern you shared with us, I completely understand the challenges that you are facing. In that case, may I know how are your parents preparing for your higher education?
7/3/24, 11:22 AM - +263 71 335 7360: Okay how are you today maam?
7/3/24, 11:23 AM - +263 71 335 7360: They have decided that we withdraw  the money so that it can help us at this difficult point.
7/3/24, 11:25 AM - +263 71 335 7360: Because things are not well to our side.
8/3/24, 8:14 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Samantha.

I hope you are doing well. Thank you for asking, I am doing fine. Excuse me for not connecting with you earlier, I was occupied with work that required my immediate attention. Thank you for letting me know that, may I know what happened due to which you want to withdraw all of a sudden? <This message was edited>
8/3/24, 9:12 AM - +263 71 335 7360: Morning Ms Kirti, here we are all fine.

Well we have figured out that due to financial shortages at this point carrying on with the scholarship can lead us to a point in which my parents will fail to meet the financial demands of the scholarship which will also affect my education.
8/3/24, 1:07 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I appreciate your honesty in sharing your concerns. To better understand and assist you, could you please provide more details about the specific financial challenges you're facing? This will help us explore potential solutions or alternatives to ensure the continuity of your scholarship and education without putting undue strain on your parents.
8/3/24, 4:10 PM - +263 71 335 7360: The financial flow has decreased so in that respect i also have siblings who are also requiring finances for their education so my parents had decided that they withdraw the money and pay for my young sisters and i will take a break and then take a step to University when they  have secured atleast finances that can cater for all the financial requirements for the first year.
