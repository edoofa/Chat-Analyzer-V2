This group will keep a record of the tasks and projects you undertake. You will be provided with the link to the group after the completion of the admission process session and on the dedicated date for your EWYL session, where you will be able to directly speak to your EWYL mentor. I hope you are clear about the purpose of the two groups.

And indeed our main aim is to provide students with affordable education and I am glad to know that you have a great understanding of the EWYL program and absolutely through EWYL students get to learn more about 21st-century skills that are necessary for today's world to be employable.

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
2/3/24, 9:59 AM - +263 71 711 4926: proceed
2/3/24, 10:02 AM - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
2/3/24, 10:03 AM - +263 71 711 4926: noted
2/3/24, 10:04 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
2/3/24, 10:04 AM - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
2/3/24, 10:06 AM - +263 71 711 4926: very clear
2/3/24, 10:07 AM - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
2/3/24, 10:07 AM - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
2/3/24, 10:08 AM - +263 71 711 4926: noted
2/3/24, 10:12 AM - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process, the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
2/3/24, 10:12 AM - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
2/3/24, 10:16 AM - +263 71 711 4926: crystal clear
2/3/24, 10:18 AM - Kirti Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
2/3/24, 10:18 AM - +263 71 711 4926: yes sir
2/3/24, 10:20 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
2/3/24, 10:20 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding until you are ready, shall we start with our discussion with me individually?
2/3/24, 10:22 AM - +263 71 711 4926: yes sir
2/3/24, 10:22 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, I shall share the videos with you now.
2/3/24, 10:22 AM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students*

This is a video by the founders of EDOOFA, in which they share 2 important qualities of successful Edoofians- who've secured a maximum scholarship and earned scholarship credits.

https://youtu.be/SIh6DcQsqYM
2/3/24, 10:22 AM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s vision for you*

The third video is about Schools, Colleges, and Universities. I'm sure you're excited to learn more about the schools, colleges, and universities on the Edoofa Platform.

2/3/24, 10:22 AM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP*

The fourth video is about the Statement of Purpose (SOP). The most important step towards securing a good scholarship is to write the Statement of Purpose but to know why it is important, watching this video will clear your doubts and questions.

2/3/24, 10:22 AM - Kirti Edoofa: I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection. 

Please go through the 4 videos, our next session will be scheduled after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarize your understanding. Hence I would like to know by when you think you will be able to go through these videos so that we can schedule our next session accordingly?
2/3/24, 11:21 AM - +263 71 711 4926: <Media omitted>
2/3/24, 11:40 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that, so could you please share your understanding of the 4 videos?
2/3/24, 12:28 PM - +263 71 711 4926: well l in my understanding  Edoofa is looking for students who are open minded despite facing different challanges you should always be positive minded and as a student inorder to attain the scholarship and get through the admission process you have to follow instructions and seek knowledge and help from expects e.g your Counselors and l have also understood that their goal as an organisation is not to make money with education they want to help us students to persue quality education internationally at affordable costs and equip us students with skill needed to be employable in this modern world through the EWYL programs where you be assaigned to real life tasks and projects .The founders also explained why they prefer certain Collages and universities ,they seek those institutions which are recognised internationally that offers the best education for Edoofians  and lastly they also explained the issue of SOP in my undestanding this is only the subjective documents that enables me to convince the admission board why l am worthy of the scholarship or admision in their school and that it also includes my abilities,achievements,my academic progress,my goals and my vision as a student
2/3/24, 12:35 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. Let me share my views as well so that it will help you expand your understanding.

*Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students:* In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. 

You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent.
2/3/24, 12:35 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s vision for you:* Here our founders talk about the most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
2/3/24, 12:35 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program:* Talking about the third video, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
2/3/24, 12:35 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP:* Another thing is that Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based. 

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
2/3/24, 12:41 PM - +263 71 711 4926: thank you shedding some light on that
2/3/24, 12:41 PM - +263 71 711 4926: noted

Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
2/3/24, 12:43 PM - +263 71 711 4926: yeah l am
2/3/24, 12:46 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by Monday at 01:30 PM.
2/3/24, 12:46 PM - Kirti Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded.

They will now evaluate your response and will be proceeding to work on them so that your university application is well prepared.

8/3/24, 8:01 AM - Kirti Edoofa: To be on the same page, If I am correct, I believe you want to pursue a bachelor's degree in the course Bachelors in Computer Application for your higher education in India as per the August 2024 intake?

8/3/24, 8:02 AM - +263 71 711 4926: yeah exactly
8/3/24, 8:03 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation. Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission* Are you ready to start with that?
8/3/24, 8:06 AM - +263 71 711 4926: <Media omitted>
8/3/24, 8:07 AM - +263 71 711 4926: the identity proof

8/3/24, 8:10 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing that, may I know if you can also share your birth certificate?
8/3/24, 8:18 AM - +263 71 711 4926: <Media omitted>
8/3/24, 8:20 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing, it is well noted. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
8/3/24, 8:20 AM - Kirti Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
8/3/24, 8:20 AM - Kirti Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
8/3/24, 8:20 AM - Kirti Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
8/3/24, 8:21 AM - +263 71 711 4926: okay
8/3/24, 8:22 AM - +263 71 711 4926: impossible
8/3/24, 8:24 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
8/3/24, 8:24 AM - Kirti Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $1000. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
8/3/24, 8:24 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
8/3/24, 8:27 AM - +263 71 711 4926: yes he did
8/3/24, 8:27 AM - +263 71 711 4926: proceed
8/3/24, 8:34 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $1600 to $2300 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
8/3/24, 8:51 AM - +263 71 711 4926: yes we are
8/3/24, 8:51 AM - +263 77 858 0639: Yes ma'am
8/3/24, 8:55 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:
8/3/24, 8:55 AM - Kirti Edoofa: 1. *Tuition Fee*: $1000 per annum
2. *Accommodation Fee*: $800 per annum
3. *Remaining Fee Components*: [Library Fee, Examination Fee, EDB and Book Bank, International Student Development Fund, 24-Hour WiFi Cost, Maintenance Fee, Water Bill, and Electricity Bill]: $200 per annum

*Total Fee: Tuition Fee $650 + Accommodation Fee $0 + Remaining Fee Components $1000 = $1650 per annum.*

Registration Fee to be paid: $1000 (deadline within two weeks of issue of the offer letter, part of the university’s first-year fee and will be adjusted against the first-year cost of education $1650). I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?
8/3/24, 8:57 AM - +263 77 858 0639: Noted
8/3/24, 8:58 AM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $1000, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $1000 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $1650 as per the above example. Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $1650 - $1000 = $650. This amount can be paid within the first three days of your arrival in India.
8/3/24, 9:01 AM - +263 71 711 4926: understood
8/3/24, 10:11 AM - Kirti Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
8/3/24, 10:11 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
8/3/24, 10:11 AM - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
8/3/24, 10:38 AM - +263 71 711 4926: noted
8/3/24, 10:38 AM - +263 71 711 4926: we may proceed
8/3/24, 10:53 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
8/3/24, 10:55 AM - +263 71 711 4926: everthing was nicely explained
8/3/24, 11:00 AM - Kirti Edoofa: That is good to know that you have understood well. Now with this, we are done with step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
8/3/24, 11:00 AM - Kirti Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one.
8/3/24, 11:00 AM - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
8/3/24, 11:02 AM - +263 71 711 4926: will be delighted to
8/3/24, 11:03 AM - Kirti Edoofa: As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received special news for the students of the 2024 admission intake. May I know if you are excited to know the news we have for you?
8/3/24, 11:04 AM - +263 71 711 4926: thank you l appreciate
8/3/24, 11:04 AM - +263 71 711 4926: yes l am
8/3/24, 11:07 AM - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome, and I am glad to know that you are also as excited as I am for your higher education. After speaking with thousands of students and parents who completed their admission process before you, we realized that the current economic situation in African countries makes it a bit challenging for parents to pay the full registration fee at once. 

In response to the same challenge, we had a detailed discussion with the academic board and university official. As a result, we developed a solution to alleviate the financial burden of the parents specifically for the registration fee due of $500 to $1000.
8/3/24, 11:08 AM - Kirti Edoofa: We at Edoofa are thrilled about this development, and I believe it will significantly help all of our students and their families. Are you aware of the solution?
8/3/24, 11:11 AM - +263 71 711 4926: no l am not
8/3/24, 11:12 AM - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright, let me share the same. With respect to the conversation we had with the academic board and the university officials, we requested them to allow the students to make the payment of their registration fee in two parts within a span of 45 days thereby reducing the financial pressure.
8/3/24, 11:12 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: Consider that your registration fee is $1000. After you will receive the offer letter, the first part of the registration fees which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, i.e. $500 needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university (For most of the universities 15 days). Subsequently, the second part of $500, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
8/3/24, 11:12 AM - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for March 15, 2024, and your registration fee stands at $1000, you'll need to make a payment of $500 on or before March 15, 2024. The remaining $500 should be paid by April 15, 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?

8/3/24, 11:19 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?

8/3/24, 11:21 AM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. As your guardian, I am sure your parents are excited to initiate the process? For the current round of admissions, only 31 scholarship seats are available and hence let us begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the payment plan offered for the registration fee. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?

8/3/24, 11:23 AM - +263 71 711 4926: *indeed
8/3/24, 11:25 AM - Kirti Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to *evaluate your application* after which if they accept your application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
