I trust this message finds you well, and I hope you are in high spirits. In recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their A-Level results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey.

We at Edoofa are filled with energy and excitement which has been fueled by the successful meet and greet sessions we hosted at the Martin Luther King Family of Schools, Harare last week. 

The entire Edoofa Team returned from Zimbabwe with a wealth of learnings, experiences, and opportunities for our students. Before I get into our experiences and the opportunities that were provided to you and your family, I want to extend my sincere gratitude to you for being a part of the event and contributing to its success. 

I am also eager to hear about your experience at the meet and greet session. Whom were you able to connect with, and how do you envision your educational journey progressing from here?
28/2/24, 4:24 PM - +263 78 581 9684: Unfortunately I couldn't make it sir but my aunt went on my behalf and according to what  she told I can confidently say  it was a great experience
29/2/24, 1:29 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Rutendo.

I hope you are doing well. It's heartening to see how each student's journey unfolds, and our conversation today reaffirms the progress we've made as an organization with our students. Do you know how many students and parents attended the seminar over just three days?
1/3/24, 6:42 AM - +263 78 581 9684: How are you ma'am
1/3/24, 6:43 AM - +263 78 581 9684: I think around 500

I hope you are doing well.

As per the records that I have, it seems as if you were not able to meet the team for a one on one? If I may ask, may I know if there is any particular reason because of which you were not able to meet the team personally?
1/3/24, 12:06 PM - +263 78 581 9684: I am in Southafrica ma'am I am here for medical attention and we didn't have money for transport back in Zimbabwe since I was already in Southafrica when the date of the event was published
1/3/24, 12:10 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I understand and that is quite alright. These exclusive interactions have been instrumental in guiding students forward on their educational paths. Since you couldn't attend the seminar, I have personally arranged for you to have similar exclusive access over phone calls and I will share the details of the call with you tomorrow.
1/3/24, 12:10 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In the meantime, I am curious if you or your family members had any interactions with students or parents who attended the seminar? It would be enlightening for you to hear their perspectives and understand the overarching experience and benefits they gained from the event so that when you have your call with the team, you know exactly what you need to discuss for your education.
1/3/24, 1:57 PM - +263 78 581 9684: They did but I am sure more information still stands ma'am
1/3/24, 2:28 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That's understandable, @263785819684 . I will make arrangements for you to connect with seminar attendees and their parents tomorrow. Hearing firsthand experiences will provide valuable insights.
1/3/24, 2:29 PM - +263 78 581 9684: Okay thank you
1/3/24, 2:29 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Additionally, I am sure you recall the highlight of our rendition of the industrial visit, SLICE-CON, showcasing how our Indian Edoofians are prepared for the professional world along with the recorded messages from these students specifically for you. What was the best part of the seminar for you and your family? What were you able to resonate with the most?
1/3/24, 2:35 PM - +263 78 581 9684: Like I said ma'am we did not attend but I really would've loved to  I am sorry I have no answer to the question ma'am
