25/1/24, 4:01 PM - +263 78 595 9492: Yes l remember some of the things
25/1/24, 4:05 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. Could you please share your understanding of the registration process on the University Admission so that I can get to know that if we are on the same page?
25/1/24, 4:10 PM - +263 78 595 9492: Where you get to be registered in an University
25/1/24, 4:10 PM - +263 78 595 9492: Before yu get admitted or get an offer letter
25/1/24, 4:10 PM - +263 78 595 9492: Is it the one
25/1/24, 4:10 PM - +263 78 595 9492: Where u get acceptance letters
25/1/24, 4:19 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. I can clearly see that you have understood the process really well. Moving forward I would like to inquire if you have any queries or concerns that you would like to share regarding the registration process?
25/1/24, 4:21 PM - +263 78 595 9492: Nothing yet
25/1/24, 4:24 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please. With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey. we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*.
25/1/24, 4:26 PM - +263 78 595 9492: Ok it's fine 😊let's move on
25/1/24, 4:27 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
25/1/24, 4:27 PM - Kirti Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
25/1/24, 4:27 PM - Kirti Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
25/1/24, 4:27 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
25/1/24, 4:30 PM - +263 78 595 9492: Yes l agree its not possible
25/1/24, 4:30 PM - +263 78 595 9492: Following
25/1/24, 4:30 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
25/1/24, 4:31 PM - Kirti Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $750. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
25/1/24, 4:31 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
25/1/24, 4:33 PM - +263 78 595 9492: Yes correct
25/1/24, 4:34 PM - +263 78 595 9492: Ok ok
25/1/24, 4:36 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
25/1/24, 4:39 PM - +263 78 595 9492: Yes am following
25/1/24, 4:40 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

Tuition Fee: $1800 per year
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per year
Registration Fee: $750 (due within two weeks)

*Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum*
I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?
25/1/24, 4:41 PM - +263 78 595 9492: Ok noted
25/1/24, 4:43 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $750, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
25/1/24, 4:44 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $750 = $2050. This amount can be paid in two installments of $1025 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $1025 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
25/1/24, 4:46 PM - +263 78 595 9492: Following
25/1/24, 4:46 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
25/1/24, 4:46 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
25/1/24, 4:46 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
25/1/24, 4:49 PM - +263 78 595 9492: How much are the visa fees and flight
25/1/24, 4:51 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @263785959492 The average flight tickets cost from $400-$500 and the visa fee is $83.
25/1/24, 4:56 PM - +263 78 595 9492: Ok noted
25/1/24, 4:56 PM - +263 78 595 9492: We can proceed
25/1/24, 4:57 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
25/1/24, 5:03 PM - +263 78 595 9492: You can explain a bit about the costs
25/1/24, 5:04 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @263785959492 may I know which cost do you want me to explain more about?
25/1/24, 5:05 PM - +263 78 595 9492: Admission process
25/1/24, 5:07 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @263785959492 I am sorry I did not understand you well here, I have shared the cost breakdown with you above so I am not able to understand which costs do you want me elaborate?
25/1/24, 5:17 PM - +263 78 595 9492: Ok ok l had misunderstood but l am ok now
25/1/24, 5:19 PM - Kirti Edoofa: It is alright please. Alright please, Now with this, we are done with step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
25/1/24, 5:19 PM - Kirti Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one.

25/1/24, 5:26 PM - +263 78 595 9492: 🔥🔥🔥
25/1/24, 6:04 PM - Kirti Edoofa: As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received special news for the students of the 2024 admission intake. May I know if you are excited to know the news we have for you?
25/1/24, 6:12 PM - +263 78 595 9492: Very excited
25/1/24, 6:13 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am happy to see that you are excited. After speaking with thousands of students and parents who completed their admission process before you, we realized that the current economic situation in African countries makes it a bit challenging for parents to pay the full registration fee at once.
25/1/24, 6:13 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In response to the same challenge, we had a detailed discussion with the academic board and university official. As a result, we developed a solution to alleviate the financial burden of the parents specifically for the registration fee due of $500 to $1000. 

We at Edoofa are thrilled about this development, and I believe it will significantly help all of our students and their families. Are you aware of the solution?
25/1/24, 6:17 PM - +263 78 595 9492: Tell me 😊
25/1/24, 6:18 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Let me share the same. With respect to the conversation we had with the academic board and the university officials, we requested them to allow the students to make the payment of their registration fee in two parts within a span of 45 days thereby reducing the financial pressure.
25/1/24, 6:18 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: Consider that your registration fee is $750. After you will receive the offer letter, the first part of the registration fees which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, i.e. $375 needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university (For most of the universities 15 days). Subsequently, the second part of $375, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
25/1/24, 6:18 PM - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for January 25, 2024, and your registration fee stands at $1000, you'll need to make a payment of $375 on or before January 25, 2024. The remaining $375 should be paid by February 25 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
25/1/24, 6:21 PM - +263 78 595 9492: Wow this is good
25/1/24, 6:22 PM - +263 78 595 9492: I don't have any questions
25/1/24, 6:24 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. As your guardian, I am sure your parents are excited to initiate the process? For the current round of admissions, only 31 scholarship seats are available and hence let us begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the payment plan offered for the registration fee. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
25/1/24, 6:25 PM - +263 78 595 9492: I am excited 😊
25/1/24, 6:25 PM - +263 78 595 9492: Eagerly waiting
25/1/24, 6:27 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am happy to hear. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to *evaluate your application* after which if they accept your application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
25/1/24, 6:33 PM - +263 78 595 9492: Ok noted with thanks
25/1/24, 6:33 PM - +263 78 595 9492: Have a good day <This message was edited>
25/1/24, 6:35 PM - +263 78 595 9492: Do we have a session tomorrow
25/1/24, 6:36 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @263785959492 No please now we will be waiting update from the universities.
25/1/24, 6:37 PM - +263 78 595 9492: Ok thank you
25/1/24, 6:49 PM - +263 77 258 7788: 100% excited
25/1/24, 6:50 PM - +263 77 258 7788: Wonderful
25/1/24, 6:56 PM - +263 77 397 1081: Hoping to get a favourable response, thanx in advance

17/2/24, 11:14 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Divine.

I hope you are doing well, since we were unable to continue with our discussion yesterday, may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
17/2/24, 11:15 AM - +263 78 595 9492: Yes I am available
17/2/24, 11:17 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing, before we start with our discussion I would like to know who from your family would be attending the summit?
17/2/24, 11:28 AM - +263 78 595 9492: My parents are both not available so l am attending alone
17/2/24, 12:07 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright please, now if you are ready let us move ahead and discuss the letter in brief.
17/2/24, 12:25 PM - +263 78 595 9492: Ok sure
17/2/24, 12:35 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In light of the offer letter you received yesterday and to ensure you don't miss this chance, I would like to provide you with the details mentioned in the offer letter for a better understanding. Please take a moment to review the information. Once you have acknowledged you can keep all your queries noted down and our team will be guiding you on the 19th of February during the summit with your concerns.
17/2/24, 12:37 PM - +263 78 595 9492: Ok you can go on
17/2/24, 12:38 PM - Kirti Edoofa: As outlined in your offer letter, your course is a four-year program, with each academic year consisting of two semesters, totaling 6 semesters for your degree. With the scholarship offered, your annual tuition fee reduces to $1150( $50 covering the university's regular examination fee, your library fee, and your ERP Fee),  and the accommodation fee is $600, making your total educational fee $1750 per annum.

Facilities covered by the fee structure include tuition, living costs, food, library access, 24-hour wifi, gymnasium usage, maintenance, water, and electricity bills. I hope this helps you understand the facilities covered.
17/2/24, 12:38 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Furthermore, being a student under the Edoofa Program, you can make your education more affordable. Through the EWYL Program, you have the opportunity to earn $800 to $1200 worth of scholarship credits per year. These credits can be used to reduce your fees.

Importantly, there is no upper limit to the scholarship credits you can earn. Your hard work and dedication in financing your higher education will determine your potential earnings.
17/2/24, 12:38 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you possess all the information and are aware of the expenses associated with your higher education at Quest Group of Institutes, could you inform me if you are prepared for me to provide you with insights about the university?
17/2/24, 12:40 PM - +263 78 595 9492: Yes you can go on
17/2/24, 12:41 PM - +263 78 595 9492: The Registration fee is 1000 right how are we going to pay it In half or full amount
17/2/24, 12:42 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Yes please, if you recall our discussion previously it can be paid in half, and rest all your doubts shall be addressed during the summit, do not worry.
17/2/24, 12:43 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Let me also tell you a bit about the Quest Group of institutions. It is the most ideal destination for international students interested in studying in India. They have more than 200 International students from more than 15 different countries in Africa and Southeast Asia.

17/2/24, 12:44 PM - +263 78 595 9492: Ok noted
17/2/24, 12:45 PM - +263 78 595 9492: 👏🏾😊
17/2/24, 12:47 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Have a blessed day and do convey my regards to your family as well.
17/2/24, 12:48 PM - +263 78 595 9492: Ok it's fine
17/2/24, 12:48 PM - +263 78 595 9492: So what are the chances of receiving another offer letter
17/2/24, 12:55 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Let me address this query of yours by helping you understand how a student's university admission process is carried out.
17/2/24, 12:56 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Scholarship Program is a merit-based scholarship, and hence a student's application is shared with multiple universities that are recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board after considering a student's eligibility, along with the university's ranking and affordability.
17/2/24, 12:56 PM - Kirti Edoofa: After we share the application with the universities, it is on the admissions team of the university to accept or reject an application, and the decision to offer a scholarship depends on them. If you have any university on your mind, you can let me know and we will surely look into your inclinations as well.
17/2/24, 12:56 PM - Kirti Edoofa: As of now, your application has been only accepted by the Quest Group of Institutes and since we have shared your application with multiple universities, we are also hoping to receive updates from multiple universities. Once we get the same, we will surely inform you, but each university takes its own time to consider the application and so you have to be patient while the universities are evaluating the application. 

I hope you are clear about this now?
17/2/24, 12:57 PM - +263 78 595 9492: It's clear
17/2/24, 12:57 PM - +263 78 595 9492: Ok l Wil update you
17/2/24, 12:58 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Surely you can. As you know each university takes its own time to evaluate an application, In that case, if you wish to wait for an update from let us say University A and end up missing the opportunity given by Quest, you would lose out on the scholarship from Quest and won't be able to join it in the future. 

To help you with that, there is a transfer option available to the students. Are you aware of that?
17/2/24, 1:01 PM - +263 78 595 9492: I didn't know
17/2/24, 1:17 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you understand about the Transfer Option better -

Without any worries/concerns, you can go ahead and reserve your scholarship seat with Quest by paying your registration fee due. 

If and when in the future, you get a better scholarship offer and wish to change your university, in that case, you would have the opportunity to change your university without paying any additional amount of money.

If you do not get a better scholarship offer, in that case, you will be able to pursue your education at Quest without risking losing out on the scholarship.
17/2/24, 1:17 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you understand it with an example as well - 

Let us say you have paid $1000 to Quest to reserve your seat with the university and after that, you get a better offer from University A where your registration fee is again $1000.

If you wish to change your university to University A, in that case, one is to pay $1000, but because you would have already paid $1000 for Quest, the same amount would be adjusted against your fee of $1000 at University A and so you will not have to pay any other additional of money to reserve your scholarship seat with University or to change your university. 

I hope you are clear with this and have a better understanding?
17/2/24, 1:18 PM - +263 78 595 9492: Shldnt they be 8 semesters
17/2/24, 1:19 PM - +263 78 595 9492: Yes l understand
17/2/24, 1:20 PM - +263 78 595 9492: Since you said it's a 4 year degree
17/2/24, 1:20 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Yes please, excuse me for the typing error.
17/2/24, 1:20 PM - +263 78 595 9492: Ok
17/2/24, 1:21 PM - +263 78 595 9492: Can you clarify on the 15 days that they want us to pay the 1000 registration fee
17/2/24, 1:22 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @263785959492 all of these concerns of your will be addressed by the team on the 19th of February during the summit, so please make sure to write down all your concerns.
17/2/24, 1:23 PM - +263 78 595 9492: Noted maam

28/2/24, 4:15 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Divine,

We at Edoofa are filled with energy and excitement which has been fueled by the successful meet and greet sessions we hosted at the Martin Luther King Family of Schools, Harare last week. 

The entire Edoofa Team returned from Zimbabwe with a wealth of learnings, experiences, and opportunities for our students. Before I get into our experiences and the opportunities that were provided to you and your family, I want to extend my sincere gratitude to you for being a part of the event and contributing to its success. 

I am also eager to hear about your experience at the meet and greet session. Whom were you able to connect with, and how do you envision your educational journey progressing from here?
28/2/24, 8:15 PM - +263 78 595 9492: I was able to talk to Mr Piyush.
29/2/24, 1:47 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Divine.

I hope you are doing well. It's heartening to see how each student's journey unfolds, and our conversation today reaffirms the progress we've made as an organization with our students. Do you know how many students and parents attended the seminar over just three days?
29/2/24, 9:45 PM - +263 78 595 9492: I am not sure
1/3/24, 7:36 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, I hope you are doing well. 

Let me tell you there were over 2700 attendees and out of these 2,700 attendees, our team had the privilege of engaging in 30-minute one-on-one sessions with 487 students, including Mr. Austin, Ms. Vilsha, Mr. Abhinav, Mr. Jyotishman, and Mr. Piyush and the director of Edoofa. As per the records that I have, it seems as if you were not able to meet the team for a one on one? If I may ask, may I know if there is any particular reason because of which you were not able to meet the team personally?
1/3/24, 7:37 PM - +263 78 595 9492: I had to rush back to Mutare ,due to the number of parents and the long queue I cldnt wait
1/3/24, 7:39 PM - +263 78 595 9492: Heard the ESAT results are out
1/3/24, 7:43 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I understand and that is quite alright. These exclusive interactions have been instrumental in guiding students forward on their educational paths. Since you couldn't attend the seminar, I have personally arranged for you to have similar exclusive access over phone calls and I will share the details of the call with you tomorrow.
1/3/24, 7:43 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In the meantime, I am curious if you or your family members had any interactions with students or parents who attended the seminar? It would be enlightening for you to hear their perspectives and understand the overarching experience and benefits they gained from the event so that when you have your call with the team, you know exactly what you need to discuss for your education.
1/3/24, 7:44 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Yes please. Thank you for reaching out to us regarding your ESAT results for 2024. The results have been released, and we are thrilled to announce the outstanding performances of three of our Edoofians:
*🥇 Brooklyn Anotida Nyambayo, Mabvuku High School - 94/100*
*🥈 Wessly Owen James, Nyahuni High School - 89/100*
*🥉 Anesu Blessing Lydia Chaurura, Montrose Girls High School - 76/100*
1/3/24, 7:44 PM - Kirti Edoofa: We take immense pride in having such high-achieving students in the Edoofa scholarship program. As per the records that we have, your ESAT result is *68/100*, and while it might not be enough for you to secure a place in the top 3, your efforts are commendable, which reflects the potential within you. It signifies a stepping stone for future growth. Remember, this is just one of the opportunities presented to you, and as you progress, we will continue to share more such opportunities in the future. Additionally, please note that the SLICE-CON'24 fund recommendation results are still pending.
1/3/24, 9:12 PM - +263 78 595 9492: 👏🏾🔥🔥
1/3/24, 9:12 PM - +263 78 595 9492: Wow
1/3/24, 9:13 PM - +263 78 595 9492: I didn't
1/3/24, 9:23 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That's understandable. I will make arrangements for you to connect with seminar attendees and their parents tomorrow. Hearing firsthand experiences will provide valuable insights.
1/3/24, 9:23 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Additionally, I am sure you recall the highlight of our rendition of the industrial visit, SLICE-CON, showcasing how our Indian Edoofians are prepared for the professional world along with the recorded messages from these students specifically for you. What was the best part of the seminar for you and your family? What were you able to resonate with the most?
1/3/24, 9:27 PM - +263 78 595 9492: Ok
1/3/24, 9:27 PM - +263 78 595 9492: Umm best part was discovering we can have sessions that can help us with our careers
1/3/24, 9:29 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Perfect! Now, while I have a plethora of insights from the seminar to share with you, I recognize that we are already approaching March, with academic classes commencing in August. With this timeline in mind, I am keen to hear about your educational plans. Have you and your family been able to discuss your aspirations and next steps for your university education in the past couple of days?
1/3/24, 9:31 PM - +263 78 595 9492: Yeah we are yet to discuss
1/3/24, 9:31 PM - +263 78 595 9492: They haven't been around
1/3/24, 9:32 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I see, and I appreciate your transparency. Educational planning requires careful consideration and wise decisions, areas where Edoofa has excelled over our 15-year journey. As Edoofa’s Parent Organization marks its 15th Anniversary on May 11th, our commitment to guiding students like yourself towards successful careers remains steadfast.
1/3/24, 9:32 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Among the positive seminar experiences, we encountered some sobering realities as well. We met students from the 2021 batch who, due to financial constraints, were unable to pursue their education in India as initially planned. They enrolled in local universities such as Chinhoyi University, Bindura University, University of Zimbabwe, and Harare Institute of Technology. However, upon meeting us, they expressed dissatisfaction with their current educational experiences and uncertain prospects for employment, despite substantial financial investments.
1/3/24, 9:32 PM - Kirti Edoofa: These students revealed that they're paying $2400 at Chinhoyi University, $2600 at Bindura University, and $3200 at the University of Zimbabwe. Despite these hefty fees, they lack confidence in their future opportunities. This predicament underscores the importance of informed decision-making in education.
1/3/24, 9:33 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I recall our last visit to Zimbabwe in May 2023, where the exchange rate was 1000 Bonds to 1 USD. Now, in just 10 months, it has skyrocketed to 18000 Bonds. This steep rise significantly has impacted students studying in Zimbabwe, increasing the challenges they face. Were you aware of this exchange rate?
1/3/24, 9:33 PM - +263 78 595 9492: Yeah l just found out about it eish it's a mes
1/3/24, 9:33 PM - +263 78 595 9492: Mess
1/3/24, 9:37 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I see and as you're aware, Zimbabwe presents its own set of challenges. Our team experienced firsthand the elevated cost of living and network difficulties, which contribute to the demand of pursuing education abroad. 

Additionally, there was a concerning safety incident involving our female staff members in Harare when they were followed by two men at night. While incidents like these serve as sobering reminders, they also highlight the importance of exploring educational opportunities in more stable environments.

What are your thoughts on these challenges? Do you perceive them as common occurrences in Zimbabwe?
1/3/24, 9:38 PM - +263 78 595 9492: Yeah they have become common in Zimbabwe.
1/3/24, 9:38 PM - +263 78 595 9492: Especially in Harare
1/3/24, 9:43 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That is quite unfortunate name and I personally wish for you to take a step forward from your current situation and get access to better opportunities. In the quest to do the same, I would like to understand how is your preparation for the registration fee going on?
1/3/24, 9:46 PM - +263 78 595 9492: We are yet to pay stil putting the money together
2/3/24, 9:57 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that, and it is good to know that you are preparing hard for your registration fee, once we get updates from the university we shall notify you till then I hope you have a great day today and the weekend ahead, feel free to reach out to me if you have any concerns to share with us.
2/3/24, 9:58 AM - +263 78 595 9492: Ok it's fine
2/3/24, 10:01 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for the above message it was for one of my other students. However, what I intend to inquire from you is about you reserving your seat with the university as per the scholarship offered to you?
2/3/24, 10:02 AM - +263 78 595 9492: We are working on that
2/3/24, 10:31 AM - Kirti Edoofa: @263785959492 may I know when you plan to reserve your seat with the university since as per the offer letter your first deadline was on the 1st of March?
2/3/24, 10:32 AM - +263 78 595 9492: I will talk to my parents when l see them,l am also not sure🙆🏾‍♂️
2/3/24, 5:32 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I would have loved to continue with our discussion, however, since it is past our available hours for Saturday I will not be able to connect now so let us plan to reconnect on Monday. Have a blessed weekend and please make sure to update me about your discussion with your parents on Monday.
2/3/24, 6:10 PM - +263 78 595 9492: Ok it's fine
6/3/24, 3:43 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Divine,

I trust you are all well. I'm writing to follow up on the messages shared above. May I know if you were able to have a discussion with your family about the conversation that we had previously?
6/3/24, 4:28 PM - +263 78 595 9492: They are coming today
8/3/24, 7:57 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Divine.

I hope you are doing well. By the time you responded yesterday, it was past our available hours so we could not get back to you, however, we are available now, may I know if you were able to have a discussion with your family by now?
