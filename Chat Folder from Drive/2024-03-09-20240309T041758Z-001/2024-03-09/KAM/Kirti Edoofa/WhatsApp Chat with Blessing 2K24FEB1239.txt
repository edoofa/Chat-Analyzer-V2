I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them. 

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
7/3/24, 4:26 PM - +27 74 728 1492: Yes we can start!
7/3/24, 4:27 PM - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
7/3/24, 4:27 PM - +27 74 728 1492: Yes I'm done Ms Kirti
7/3/24, 4:28 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
7/3/24, 4:28 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
7/3/24, 4:29 PM - +27 74 728 1492: Yes very clear
7/3/24, 4:30 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
7/3/24, 4:30 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
7/3/24, 4:32 PM - +27 74 728 1492: Yes Ms Kirti , go on!
7/3/24, 4:32 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process, the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
7/3/24, 4:32 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
7/3/24, 4:35 PM - +27 74 728 1492: Very clear Ms Kirti, thank you
7/3/24, 4:35 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
7/3/24, 4:36 PM - +27 74 728 1492: Yes Ms Kirti we can start
7/3/24, 4:36 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
7/3/24, 4:36 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding until you are ready, shall we start with our discussion with me individually?
7/3/24, 4:37 PM - +27 74 728 1492: Yes we can
7/3/24, 4:43 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, I shall share the videos with you now.

8/3/24, 12:25 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That is good to know, please share your understanding of the 4 videos?
8/3/24, 12:41 PM - +27 74 728 1492: Ok so in video 1:Qualities of a successful student who've secured a maximum scholarship and earned scholarship credits. The student should be able to follow the instructions and be teachable. The student should also be open minded and thinking out of the box.
Video 2:Vision of Edoofa and important character trait which distinguish a successful student from the rest of the crowd. The real vision is to take from a student's capacity to making a huge success and making students employable through the SEELS program.Edoofa solve the problem of high cost of education by offering scholarship and making education affordable.The vision is also to make students more responsible and independent.
Video 3: Schools, colleges and universities under the EDOOFA program.
There is more than a decade of hardwork invested in creating systems and platforms so that students live the life of their dreams. The Edoofa works with schools that are not jus making money out of education but schools which will work with students on the EWYL and student employability. Schools that will acquire the student with the right attitude, knowledge and skills 
Video 4: Preparation for interactive sessions with schools. The Statement of purpose which is an opportunity for the student to make a great first impression. This is also a chance for the student to objectively qualify themselves for the university.
8/3/24, 12:42 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. Let me share my views as well so that it will help you expand your understanding.

*Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students:* In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. 

You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent.
8/3/24, 12:42 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s vision for you:* Here our founders talk about the most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
8/3/24, 12:42 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program:* Talking about the third video, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
8/3/24, 12:42 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP:* Another thing is that Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based. 

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
8/3/24, 12:45 PM - +27 74 728 1492: Ok thank you Ms Kirti for sharing this, I've literally understood the process
8/3/24, 12:48 PM - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome and that is good to know. Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*.
