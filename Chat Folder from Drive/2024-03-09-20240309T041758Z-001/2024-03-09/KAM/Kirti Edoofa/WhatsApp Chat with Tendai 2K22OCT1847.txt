I trust this message finds you well. I am *Ms. Kirti, the Admission Officer at Edoofa*.  I will be handling the next steps in your university admission journey and will be directing you in the right direction. As we step into the second week of January, I wanted to reach out and share an exciting milestone that India as a country achieved within the first week of 2024 - the successful India's Chandrayaan-3 Engine Test. <This message was edited>
16/1/24, 8:21 PM - Kirti Edoofa: This accomplishment is responsible for the third lunar mission, aiming to land a rover on the Moon's south polar region and conduct scientific studies that could check Moon's viability to sustain life. It signifies a significant scientific advancement, laying the groundwork for future progress.
16/1/24, 8:22 PM - Kirti Edoofa: This achievement has not only pushed boundaries but also inspired young minds all over the world to pursue their dreams. On the same note, I wanted to extend my heartiest wishes for the New Year to you and your family and check in to see how you and your family started your year?

17/1/24, 11:10 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Tendai.

I hope you are doing well. It is good to connect with you as well.  With great excitement and pride, I also want to share that over the past few days, the Edoofa team has been immersed in an exciting event we had in store for our students. Edoofa hosted a conference - the Symposium of Leaders, Innovators, and Creators at Edoofa, also known as 'SLICE-CON.'
17/1/24, 11:10 AM - Kirti Edoofa: The conference was attended by all the Edoofians of 2023 and a few senior Edoofians from previous batches. It focused on the art of creation, innovation, and, most importantly, the mindset required to make an impact in one's career.
17/1/24, 11:11 AM - Kirti Edoofa: During this Industrial Visit and the conference - SLICE CON, Corporate leaders, such as the CEOs and Co-founders from renowned companies like Rage Coffee, Sirona Hygiene, Jolin New York, and more, shared their insights and experiences. These individuals are at the helm of multi-millionaire brands, leading large marketing teams. Their presence added immense value, providing students with the opportunity to engage in transformative conversations.
17/1/24, 11:11 AM - Kirti Edoofa: We believe that interactions with such industry leaders can bring significant transformations to students' lives, enhancing their business acumen. Our Edoofians maximized this opportunity, having life-changing conversations with these influential figures. The main objective of the event was to emphasize the importance of thinking outside the box, and encouraging students to believe in themselves and their dreams. Before we discuss your admission journey further, I wanted to share a glimpse of the event, and I hope you are excited to attend similar events when you come to India.

17/1/24, 12:35 PM - +263 77 755 3969: That's amazing
17/1/24, 12:50 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Indeed it was amazing to be with our Edoofains. Over the past couple of days, we also had the pleasure of conversing with some of our students who expressed their joy upon receiving their A-Level results.

Reflecting on my own school days, I vividly recall the mix of excitement and anticipation surrounding the result day. It is an important moment that shapes the path of one’s academic journey.
17/1/24, 12:50 PM - Kirti Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?
17/1/24, 12:53 PM - +263 77 755 3969: <Media omitted>
17/1/24, 12:54 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your results with us. I noticed that your A-level results didn't turn out as we had hoped, particularly with the challenge in one subject. However, I want to take a moment to remind you that this result is not a reflection of your abilities or potential. It's simply a hurdle on your academic journey, one that you are more than capable of overcoming.
17/1/24, 12:54 PM - Kirti Edoofa: It's important to remember that everyone faces setbacks at some point. What matters most is how we respond to them. This is an opportunity for growth and learning. Reflect on the experience, identify areas for improvement, and use this as a stepping stone towards future successes.
17/1/24, 12:54 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Rest assured, that you have Edoofa’s full support in navigating this phase. Whether it's discussing options for retaking the exam, exploring alternative career paths, or just needing someone to guide you, we are here for you. 

I have taken note of your results and I will add them to your scholarship application. This will enable us to engage in discussions with the academic board and chart the best course of action for your next steps.
17/1/24, 12:54 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Kindly allow me time till Monday to thoroughly evaluate your results and plan the way forward. Once I have evaluated your results, along with all the other applications for your university admission, we will reconnect with you to discuss the next steps in your academic journey.
17/1/24, 12:55 PM - +263 77 755 3969: That's true
17/1/24, 12:56 PM - +263 77 755 3969: Thank you so much # proud edoofian

I hope you are doing well and I find you in the best of sports. Kindly excuse me for not connecting with you earlier. As per your application file, you are supposed to make the payment of the remaining part of the Edoofa Enrollment fee of $150. 

Considering the same, I wanted to reach out to you, share a gentle reminder, and try to understand if you have been able to make the payment of your fee by now so that we can update the academic board accordingly?
7/2/24, 9:03 PM - +263 77 755 3969: I'm doing gud thank you

9/2/24, 3:24 PM - +263 77 755 3969: Mostly it was network issues

10/2/24, 10:53 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings Tendai, 

I trust this message finds you in good health. I am *Ms. Kirti, the Admission Officer at Edoofa*  Today while I was organizing my day, I was going through our records, and I came across your scholarship application and noticed that you were one of the dedicated students who was so keen on pursuing your education abroad. However, because of some situations beyond your control, you were not able to turn your dream into a reality and since then we lost touch with each other.

Hence, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out personally and just check in with you and your family. How have you been doing? Were you able to start your higher education by now, or are you still exploring better opportunities?
10/2/24, 12:39 PM - +263 77 268 8564: I am organizing to go to Harare  next weekend  to deposit  the money

26/2/24, 6:01 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening, Parents and Tendai.

I trust you are in good health. I apologize for not reaching out earlier, as my family is currently facing a challenging situation with the passing of my grandfather. I have been occupied with the necessary rituals and, as a result, I was unable to connect with you.
26/2/24, 6:05 PM - +263 77 755 3969: Im doing good and you
26/2/24, 6:06 PM - +263 77 755 3969: Very sorry
27/2/24, 5:59 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, I hope you are doing well.

I appreciate your kind words. Thank you for your sympathy and support. It means a lot to my family and me. However, I am now available to connect with you now
28/2/24, 3:59 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Tendai,

We at Edoofa are filled with energy and excitement which has been fueled by the successful meet and greet sessions we hosted at the Martin Luther King Family of Schools, Harare last week. 

The entire Edoofa Team returned from Zimbabwe with a wealth of learnings, experiences, and opportunities for our students. Before I get into our experiences and the opportunities that were provided to you and your family, I want to extend my sincere gratitude to you for being a part of the event and contributing to its success. 

I am also eager to hear about your experience at the meet and greet session. Whom were you able to connect with, and how do you envision your educational journey progressing from here?
28/2/24, 8:32 PM - +263 77 755 3969: It was a great opportunity to interact with team edoofa .l was so happy because l was inlighted on many things which l didn't know.Mr Angad Singh was talking about the importance of edoofa and encouraging us that education is the key to success he also said that our aim is to provide quality education at an affordable price.Again I heard Mr Abnav explaining to us about education in andia also about the insights in slice con 24 and it was so wonderful hearing other students that they want to attend it again .

I was happy to see some of my friends on the videos which l saw and  l am hoping that l will join them soon
28/2/24, 8:36 PM - +263 77 755 3969: <Media omitted>
29/2/24, 1:48 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Tendai.

I hope you are doing well. It's heartening to see how each student's journey unfolds, and our conversation today reaffirms the progress we've made as an organization with our students. Do you know how many students and parents attended the seminar over just three days?
29/2/24, 2:30 PM - +263 77 755 3969: We were around 250 both parents and students
29/2/24, 2:33 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @263777553969, there were over 2700 attendees and out of these 2,700 attendees, our team had the privilege of engaging in 30-minute one-on-one sessions with 487 students, including Mr. Austin, Ms. Vilsha, Mr. Abhinav, Mr. Jyotishman, and Mr. Piyush and the director of Edoofa. As per the records that I have, it seems as if you were not able to meet the team for a one on one? If I may ask, may I know if there is any particular reason because of which you were not able to meet the team personally?
29/2/24, 2:34 PM - +263 77 755 3969: I attend on Saturday only
29/2/24, 2:53 PM - +263 77 755 3969: What happened is l wanted to travel back to Mutare so  l waited for a while then  l found out that many studenets where eager  to see team edoofa so l did not get the chance
29/2/24, 3:09 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I understand and that is quite alright. These exclusive interactions have been instrumental in guiding students forward on their educational paths. Since you couldn't attend the seminar, I have personally arranged for you to have similar exclusive access over phone calls and I will share the details of the call with you tomorrow.
29/2/24, 3:09 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In the meantime, I am curious if you or your family members had any interactions with students or parents who attended the seminar? It would be enlightening for you to hear their perspectives and understand the overarching experience and benefits they gained from the event so that when you have your call with the team, you know exactly what you need to discuss for your education.
29/2/24, 3:13 PM - +263 77 755 3969: Thank you so much for giving me another chance
29/2/24, 3:19 PM - +263 77 755 3969: Before we settle down while we were outside the hall. student were not certain about having a job after studying in India
29/2/24, 3:31 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing that, I will make arrangements for you to connect with seminar attendees and their parents tomorrow. Hearing firsthand experiences will provide valuable insights.
29/2/24, 3:31 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Additionally, I am sure you recall the highlight of our rendition of the industrial visit, SLICE-CON, showcasing how our Indian Edoofians are prepared for the professional world along with the recorded messages from these students specifically for you. What was the best part of the seminar for you and your family? What were you able to resonate with the most?
29/2/24, 3:35 PM - +263 77 755 3969: That's true
29/2/24, 3:57 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I shall wait for your response to this message as well.
29/2/24, 6:02 PM - +263 77 755 3969: I heard that there were visionary speakers who were sharing their wisdom to edoofians leading them to a success
29/2/24, 6:49 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Perfect! Now, while I have a plethora of insights from the seminar to share with you, I recognize that we are already approaching March, with academic classes commencing in August. With this timeline in mind, I am keen to hear about your educational plans. Have you and your family been able to discuss your aspirations and next steps for your university education in the past couple of days?
29/2/24, 7:02 PM - +263 77 755 3969: I received an offer letter from my mentor but due to circumstances we did not manage to pay the fee in time
29/2/24, 7:43 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I completely understand that and indeed I remember you were offered a scholarship from Galgotias University  and I appreciate your transparency. Educational planning requires careful consideration and wise decisions, areas where Edoofa has excelled over our 15-year journey. As Edoofa’s Parent Organization marks its 15th Anniversary on May 11th, our commitment to guiding students like yourself towards successful careers remains steadfast.
29/2/24, 7:43 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Among the positive seminar experiences, we encountered some sobering realities as well. We met students from the 2021 batch who, due to financial constraints, were unable to pursue their education in India as initially planned. They enrolled in local universities such as Chinhoyi University, Bindura University, University of Zimbabwe, and Harare Institute of Technology. However, upon meeting us, they expressed dissatisfaction with their current educational experiences and uncertain prospects for employment, despite substantial financial investments.
29/2/24, 7:43 PM - Kirti Edoofa: These students revealed that they're paying $2400 at Chinhoyi University, $2600 at Bindura University, and $3200 at the University of Zimbabwe. Despite these hefty fees, they lack confidence in their future opportunities. This predicament underscores the importance of informed decision-making in education.
29/2/24, 7:43 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I recall our last visit to Zimbabwe in May 2023, where the exchange rate was 1000 Bonds to 1 USD. Now, in just 10 months, it has skyrocketed to 18000 Bonds. This steep rise significantly has impacted students studying in Zimbabwe, increasing the challenges they face. Were you aware of this exchange rate?
29/2/24, 8:14 PM - +263 77 755 3969: Yes lm aware of that the more the rate increases the more challenges we get
29/2/24, 8:16 PM - +263 77 755 3969: Yes that's true on that issue if l pay the fee anyday from now will l able to get another chance
29/2/24, 8:21 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I see and as you're aware, Zimbabwe presents its own set of challenges. Our team experienced firsthand the elevated cost of living and network difficulties, which contribute to the demand of pursuing education abroad. 

Additionally, there was a concerning safety incident involving our female staff members in Harare when they were followed by two men at night. While incidents like these serve as sobering reminders, they also highlight the importance of exploring educational opportunities in more stable environments.

What are your thoughts on these challenges? Do you perceive them as common occurrences in Zimbabwe?
29/2/24, 8:43 PM - +263 77 755 3969: In terms of network problems it can disrupt learning and cause frustration for students and it can be difficult to access online resouses such as reseach materials in that curse most students intent to study abroad were they get better facilities.

It is true to study in stable invironment such that you are free knowing that nothing can harm me
29/2/24, 9:27 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That is quite unfortunate and I personally wish for you to take a step forward from your current situation and get access to better opportunities so in light of this, may I know how your preparation for your registration fee is going on?
29/2/24, 9:44 PM - +263 77 755 3969: The remaining registration fee will be paid next week
1/3/24, 7:35 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, I hope you are doing well. Thank you for keeping me posted it is duly noted with us.
2/3/24, 8:02 PM - +263 77 755 3969: Good evening Ms Kirti is the  remaining edoofa registration fee deposited in Mr Chirles Jerera's account
4/3/24, 8:54 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, I hope you are doing well. 

Yes please, you can deposit the registration fee amount through Mr. Charles.
4/3/24, 12:00 PM - +263 77 755 3969: Okay thank you
8/3/24, 9:18 AM - +263 77 755 3969: <Media omitted>
8/3/24, 11:05 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Tendai.

I hope you are doing well. Thank you for sharing the payment receipt for your university registration fee, we have duly noted it.
