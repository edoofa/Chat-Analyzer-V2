This group will keep a record of the tasks and projects you undertake. You will be provided with the link to the group after the completion of the admission process session and on the dedicated date for your EWYL session, where you will be able to directly speak to your EWYL mentor. I hope you are clear about the purpose of the two groups.
1/3/24, 2:33 PM - +263 78 219 1395: OK kindly noted ma'am.
1/3/24, 2:33 PM - +263 78 219 1395: It's OK no problem. I'm following.
1/3/24, 2:35 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that you are clear about the purpose of the two WhatsApp groups and it's reassuring to hear this from your end. I also had a recent conversation with your counselor, during which he provided me with some insights into your academic background and career aspirations. I must commend your family, must take great pride in your achievements and be dedicated to ensuring your access to the finest opportunities to launch your career.

Speaking of valuable opportunities, I am also curious to learn more about your counseling session with your counselor and to understand which aspects of the Edoofa Scholarship Program have particularly impressed you thus far. Can you share this with me?
1/3/24, 2:54 PM - +263 78 219 1395: OK. During my counseling session the EWYL program fascinated me the most and the recruitment partners. What really impressed was the issue that with EWYL l can earn credit and get to lessen the burden for my parents on tuition fee.
1/3/24, 3:10 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am delighted to know that you had such a great experience. I am glad to know that the EWYL program was able to catch your attention, through EWYL students get to learn more about 21st-century skills that are necessary for today's world to be employable.

I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them. 

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
6/3/24, 3:39 PM - +263 77 343 5521: Yes Madam
6/3/24, 3:39 PM - +263 77 343 5521: Go ahead

6/3/24, 3:46 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
6/3/24, 3:47 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
6/3/24, 3:49 PM - +263 77 343 5521: Yes Madam , quite clear
6/3/24, 3:51 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
6/3/24, 3:51 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
6/3/24, 3:54 PM - +263 77 343 5521: Yes Madam still together
6/3/24, 3:54 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process, the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
6/3/24, 3:54 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?

8/3/24, 2:37 PM - +263 78 219 1395: OK l just finished this one. The founders of Edoofa are sharing their vision. And one of the points they reiterated was that they assist a child by helping him or gain a scholarship and also scoop scholarship credits. They also mentioned the role of Edoofa in the education system particularly higher education particularly on the challenge of exorbitant fees. They also spoke of their role in  parenting Edoofians to become better students and how they are bridging the gap of nowadays parenting of spoiling children and not exposing them to real life situations
8/3/24, 3:21 PM - +263 78 219 1395: I have listened to this one it's about the protocols, procedure, documentation undertaken by an Edoofian to secure admission place to different universities that meets Edoofa's criteria of the best  university.
8/3/24, 3:31 PM - +263 78 219 1395: These are the videos that l managed to watch ma'am. Unfortunately l have run out of data. I will be able to watch the video when l reach home that's when l will have access to data.
