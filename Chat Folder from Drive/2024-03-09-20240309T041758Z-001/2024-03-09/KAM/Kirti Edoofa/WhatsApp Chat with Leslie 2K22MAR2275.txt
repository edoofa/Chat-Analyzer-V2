I hope this message finds you in good health and high spirits. It is a pleasure to reconnect with you today, and I am excited to share an important update with you.

Since our last discussion, the admissions team has been working diligently to process your scholarship application for universities in India under the Endowment plan. I am pleased to inform you that your application has been accepted by one of the leading universities, *PDM University* in India, and they have decided to offer you a scholarship.
20/1/24, 10:06 AM - Kirti Edoofa: The university will be mailing you the official offer letter shortly. However, since we received it in advance, we wanted to share this wonderful news with you and provide a head start on our discussions. I kindly request you to take your time to thoroughly review the letter. We will have a detailed discussion about its contents, Hence once you have gone through the letter please do let me know. 

In the meantime, I recommend that you make note of any questions or concerns that may arise as you review the letter. By setting a specific time, we can ensure that one of your family representatives will be available to connect with us.
20/1/24, 10:07 AM - Kirti Edoofa: This discussion will be an opportunity for me to assist you in gaining a better understanding of the remaining contents of your offer letter, addressing any queries you may have, and providing guidance on the requirements for the rest of your admission journey.

To start our discussion, please confirm once you have gone through the letter. Please note that we are available in the window from 1:00 PM to 04:00 PM, and we will arrange a suitable connection time accordingly.

24/1/24, 4:26 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon parents and Leslie,

I hope this message finds you in good health. I wanted to check in following the message I sent previously. I haven't received a response yet and thought perhaps my message didn't reach you.

With that in mind, I'm reaching out again to see if you had the opportunity to go through my previous message and to ascertain if we are still connected with each other?
30/1/24, 6:40 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good Evening, Parents and Leslie,

I hope this message finds you well and in high spirits. Over the past couple of days, I have been reaching out to you to discuss your offer letter from *PDM University* and to help you understand the next steps for your university admission journey. However, I have not been able to get any update from your end.
30/1/24, 6:42 PM - Kirti Edoofa: As you recognize, the Edoofa scholarship opportunity is highly competitive, with students from all over the world vying for the scholarship and you have been given a valuable chance to shape your future path.
30/1/24, 6:42 PM - Kirti Edoofa: If I know you well from our past discussions, this is not something you will lose out on easily. Hence, that is the reason, I am a bit worried because you have not connected with us over the past couple of days. I believe something must have been bothering you that has prevented you from connecting with us. Is my understanding correct?
10/2/24, 10:48 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings Leslie, 

I trust this message finds you in good health. I am *Ms. Kirti, the Admission officer at Edoofa.*  Today while I was organizing my day, I was going through our records, and I came across your scholarship application and noticed that you were one of the dedicated students who was so keen on pursuing your education abroad. However, because of some situations beyond your control, you were not able to turn your dream into a reality and since then we lost touch with each other.

Hence, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out personally and just check in with you and your family. How have you been doing? Were you able to start your higher education by now, or are you still exploring better opportunities?
12/2/24, 1:18 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good Afternoon,

28/2/24, 3:57 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Leslie,

We at Edoofa are filled with energy and excitement which has been fueled by the successful meet and greet sessions we hosted at the Martin Luther King Family of Schools, Harare last week. 

The entire Edoofa Team returned from Zimbabwe with a wealth of learnings, experiences, and opportunities for our students. Before I get into our experiences and the opportunities that were provided to you and your family, I want to extend my sincere gratitude to you for being a part of the event and contributing to its success. 

I am also eager to hear about your experience at the meet and greet session. Whom were you able to connect with, and how do you envision your educational journey progressing from here?
8/3/24, 1:39 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Leslie,

I trust you are all well. I'm writing to follow up. I noticed that you have not responded for a long time now since an international scholarship offer letter is once in a lifetime opportunity your lack of response has left a negative response on your application. 

Therefore, I am reaching out to you once more to inquire if you have had a chance to read my earlier message and to confirm whether we are still in communication.
