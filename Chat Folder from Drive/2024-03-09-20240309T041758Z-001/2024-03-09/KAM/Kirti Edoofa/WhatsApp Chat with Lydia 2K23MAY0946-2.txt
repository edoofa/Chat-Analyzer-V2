12/1/24, 5:49 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Lydia

I trust this message finds you in good health. As we step into the second week of January, I wanted to reach out and share an exciting milestone that India as a country achieved within the first week of 2024 - the successful India's Chandrayaan-3 Engine Test.
12/1/24, 5:49 PM - Kirti Edoofa: This accomplishment is responsible for the third lunar mission, aiming to land a rover on the Moon's south polar region and conduct scientific studies that could check Moon's viability to sustain life. It signifies a significant scientific advancement, laying the groundwork for future progress.
12/1/24, 5:50 PM - Kirti Edoofa: This achievement has not only pushed boundaries but also inspired young minds all over the world to pursue their dreams. On the same note, I wanted to extend my heartiest wishes for the New Year to you and your family and check in to see how you and your family started your year?
12/1/24, 7:25 PM - +263 71 432 6077: We are doing well and you
12/1/24, 7:27 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for asking, I am doing great. I am glad to hear that. With great excitement and pride, I also want to share that over the past few days, the Edoofa team has been immersed in an exciting event we had in store for our students. Edoofa hosted a conference - the Symposium of Leaders, Innovators, and Creators at Edoofa, also known as 'SLICE-CON.'

The conference was attended by all the Edoofians of 2023 and a few senior Edoofians from previous batches. It focused on the art of creation, innovation, and, most importantly, the mindset required to make an impact in one's career.
12/1/24, 7:27 PM - Kirti Edoofa: During this Industrial Visit and the conference - SLICE CON, Corporate leaders, such as the CEOs and Co-founders from renowned companies like Rage Coffee, Sirona Hygiene, Jolin New York, and more, shared their insights and experiences. These individuals are at the helm of multi-millionaire brands, leading large marketing teams. Their presence added immense value, providing students with the opportunity to engage in transformative conversations.
12/1/24, 7:27 PM - Kirti Edoofa: We believe that interactions with such industry leaders can bring significant transformations to students' lives, enhancing their business acumen. Our Edoofians maximized this opportunity, having life-changing conversations with these influential figures. The main objective of the event was to emphasize the importance of thinking outside the box, and encouraging students to believe in themselves and their dreams. Before we discuss your admission journey further, I wanted to share a glimpse of the event, and I hope you are excited to attend similar events when you come to India.

12/1/24, 7:34 PM - Kirti Edoofa: These certificates are basically participation certificates for the Edoofians who participated in the event.
12/1/24, 7:35 PM - +263 71 432 6077: It seems you really did enjoy 😁
12/1/24, 7:35 PM - +263 71 432 6077: 😊 understood
12/1/24, 7:42 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Indeed it was very interesting and meeting our Edoofians is always fun. And it is amazing to hear your thoughts. We also had the pleasure of conversing with some of our students who expressed their joy upon receiving their A-Level results.

Reflecting on my own school days, I vividly recall the mix of excitement and anticipation surrounding the result day. It is an important moment that shapes the path of one’s academic journey.
12/1/24, 7:42 PM - Kirti Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?
13/1/24, 1:17 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, I was hoping to get a response from you, however, you did not respond, since it's been a long day for me, along with the conclusion of our working hours, let's plan to reconnect on Monday to continue our discussion. I'm optimistic that you'll be able to connect then. Have a great night, and looking forward to our conversation Monday.
25/1/24, 11:48 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Lydia,

I hope this message finds you all well and in high spirits. I apologize for not being in touch over the past few days. Unfortunately, I was dealing with a significant ENT infection and needed to follow my doctor's recommendation for rest, which meant taking some time off to prioritize my health. As a result, I was unable to inform you about my temporary absence. Thankfully, I'm feeling considerably better now and am ready to resume our interactions. Before we proceed with our discussion, I'd like to catch up - how have you and your family been lately?
25/1/24, 12:36 PM - +263 77 592 8657: We are good thank you for asking.. we happy you are better nw 🙏🙏
25/1/24, 12:47 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for your concern I really appreciate it and I am happy to know that you are doing good. May I know if you are available to connect for the discussion?
25/1/24, 2:25 PM - +263 77 592 8657: Am Lydia's mom I am available for the discussion. Lydia is out of network.
25/1/24, 4:23 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @263775928657 It is alright, please we can connect now if you are available?
25/1/24, 5:26 PM - +263 77 592 8657: Sure we can.
25/1/24, 6:03 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing. In recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their A-Level results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey.
25/1/24, 6:03 PM - Kirti Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?
25/1/24, 9:51 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I was hoping to get a response from you, however, given that it's been a long day for me, along with the conclusion of our working hours, let's plan to reconnect tomorrow to continue our discussion. I'm optimistic that you'll be able to connect then. Have a great night, and looking forward to our conversation tomorrow.

26/1/24, 11:44 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Lydia.

I hope you are doing well. With regard to our conversation yesterday since we were not able to move further with our discussion may I know if you are available to connect with us now so that we can continue with our discussion?
26/1/24, 11:45 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your results, and congratulations on successfully clearing all your A-Level subjects! Your hard work over the past few months has truly paid off.

I am sure your family is immensely proud of your achievements. Your A-level results have been duly noted, and we will quickly add them to your scholarship application. This will enable us to engage in discussions with the academic board and chart the best course of action for your next steps.
26/1/24, 11:59 AM - +263 71 432 6077: Yah I'm available now
26/1/24, 12:00 PM - +263 71 432 6077: Thank you
26/1/24, 12:01 PM - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. On the auspicious occasion of Republic Day, I extend my heartfelt greetings to you and your loved ones. Today marks a significant moment in our nation's history, a day when we commemorate the enactment of our Constitution and celebrate the enduring spirit of democracy and unity that defines us as a country.
26/1/24, 12:01 PM - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
26/1/24, 12:02 PM - +263 71 432 6077: Same to you
26/1/24, 12:26 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for your wishes. May I know if you are ready to start with the discussion now?
26/1/24, 12:27 PM - +263 71 432 6077: Yes I am
26/1/24, 12:29 PM - Kirti Edoofa: To be on the same page, If I am correct, I believe you want to pursue a bachelor's degree in the course BSc Biomedical Science for your higher education in India as per the August 2024 intake?
26/1/24, 12:33 PM - +263 71 432 6077: That's correct
26/1/24, 12:42 PM - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
26/1/24, 12:43 PM - +263 71 432 6077: Yahhh I still remember
26/1/24, 12:49 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. Could you please share your understanding of the registration process on the University Admission so that I can get to know that if we are on the same page?
26/1/24, 1:01 PM - +263 71 432 6077: Can you assist me I can't seem to recall
26/1/24, 1:02 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know about that. It is alright, I am more than happy to help you recall and understand the process of the admission process. With that in mind, I will provide you with a detailed breakdown and summary of the process. So, if you are ready, may I proceed with this?
26/1/24, 1:07 PM - +263 71 432 6077: Yes you may proceed
26/1/24, 1:08 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. The main focus of our university admission process is completing your scholarship application and sharing it with endorsed universities. Edoofa will submit your application to multiple universities, which will evaluate your eligibility in a day or two. If eligible, you'll receive an offer letter with scholarship details, tuition fees, accommodation costs, and registration fees. If multiple universities accept your application, you can't practically study at all of them.
26/1/24, 1:09 PM - Kirti Edoofa: You must make a crucial decision among the various offer letters you receive, considering factors like university exposure, ranking, and affordability. After choosing a university, you need to reserve your scholarship seat by paying a registration fee, typically $500 to $750, within two to four weeks of receiving the offer letter. This fee is considered part of the first-year tuition for Edoofa Program students and should be paid in your home country to secure the seat. Are we clear here?
26/1/24, 1:10 PM - +263 71 432 6077: Very clear
26/1/24, 1:10 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. You are qualified for a scholarship through Edoofa, reducing your annual education cost in India to $2000 to $3000, covering tuition, food, accommodation, and other expenses. Let's use an example to explain the registration process. If your chosen university has the following fees:

Tuition Fee: $1800 per year
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per year
Registration Fee: $750 (due within two weeks)
26/1/24, 1:10 PM - Kirti Edoofa: The total fee would be a Tuition Fee of $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee of $1000 = $2800 per year. To reserve your scholarship seat, you pay the $750 registration fee, which is adjusted to your first-year fee, making it $2800 - $750 = $2050. You can pay this in two installments of $1025 each, with the first due within the first three days of your arrival in India. The remaining balance can be paid in monthly installments for financial flexibility and on-time payments. Please let me know if you are clear here.
26/1/24, 1:11 PM - +263 71 432 6077: I'm still following
26/1/24, 1:12 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Upon successfully paying the registration fee, your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account will be linked to the university's fee account. This allows you to use your EWYL credits to offset your annual university fees, providing you with financial flexibility throughout your education. Additionally, after the registration fee payment, you will receive the Admission Acceptance Letter, which is crucial for securing admission and obtaining your student visa. If you have any questions about the admission process or the associated costs for your higher education, please feel free to ask.
26/1/24, 1:13 PM - +263 71 432 6077: Understood you may continue
26/1/24, 1:15 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, Now with this, we are done with step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
26/1/24, 1:15 PM - Kirti Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one.
26/1/24, 1:15 PM - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
26/1/24, 1:17 PM - +263 71 432 6077: Yes we are
26/1/24, 1:17 PM - Kirti Edoofa: As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received special news for the students of the 2024 admission intake. May I know if you are excited to know the news we have for you?
26/1/24, 1:18 PM - +263 71 432 6077: Thank you
26/1/24, 1:21 PM - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. After speaking with thousands of students and parents who completed their admission process before you, we realized that the current economic situation in African countries makes it a bit challenging for parents to pay the full registration fee at once.
26/1/24, 1:21 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In response to the same challenge, we had a detailed discussion with the academic board and university official. As a result, we developed a solution to alleviate the financial burden of the parents specifically for the registration fee due of $500 to $1000. 

We at Edoofa are thrilled about this development, and I believe it will significantly help all of our students and their families. Are you aware of the solution?
26/1/24, 1:26 PM - +263 71 432 6077: yes I am aware of the financial situation in my country. We are grateful thank u so much
26/1/24, 1:28 PM - Kirti Edoofa: With respect to the conversation we had with the academic board and the university officials, we requested them to allow the students to make the payment of their registration fee in two parts within a span of 45 days thereby reducing the financial pressure.
26/1/24, 1:29 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: Consider that your registration fee is $750. After you will receive the offer letter, the first part of the registration fees which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, i.e. $375 needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university (For most of the universities 15 days). Subsequently, the second part of $375, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
26/1/24, 1:29 PM - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for January 25, 2024, and your registration fee stands at $750, you'll need to make a payment of $375 on or before January 25, 2024. The remaining $375 should be paid by February 25 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
26/1/24, 1:29 PM - +263 71 432 6077: Understood
26/1/24, 1:30 PM - +263 71 432 6077: No so far it's all well explained
26/1/24, 1:31 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. As your guardian, I am sure your parents are excited to initiate the process? For the current round of admissions, only 31 scholarship seats are available and hence let us begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the payment plan offered for the registration fee. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
26/1/24, 1:32 PM - +263 71 432 6077: Yes I am
26/1/24, 1:32 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to *evaluate your application* after which if they accept your application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
