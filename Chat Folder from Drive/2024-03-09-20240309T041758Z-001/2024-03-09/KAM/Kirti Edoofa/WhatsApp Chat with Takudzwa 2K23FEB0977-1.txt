26/12/23, 11:52 AM - Shivjeet Edoofa added you
12/1/24, 4:46 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Takudzwa.

I trust this message finds you well. I am *Ms. Kirti, the Admission Officer at Edoofa.* I would like to inform you that Mr. Shivjeet will no longer be available, as he is advancing in his career with a new opportunity. While his departure is a loss for us, we are also filled with pride and joy for his future endeavors. Moving forward, I will be handling the next steps in your university admission journey and will be directing you in the right direction.
12/1/24, 4:46 PM - Kirti Edoofa: It has been a while since we last connected, and I wanted to take this opportunity to share some exciting news with you. Recently, Edoofa hosted a conference called the *Symposium of Leaders, Innovators, and Creators at Edoofa, also known as 'SLICE-CON.'* 

The conference was attended by all the Edoofians of 2023 and a few senior Edoofians from previous batches. It focused on the art of creation, innovation, and, most importantly, the mindset required to make an impact in one's career.
12/1/24, 4:46 PM - Kirti Edoofa: During this Industrial Visit and the conference - SLICE CON, Corporate leaders, such as the CEOs and Co-founders from renowned companies like Rage Coffee, Sirona Hygiene, Jolin New York, and more, shared their insights and experiences. These individuals are at the helm of multi-millionaire brands, leading large marketing teams. Their presence added immense value, providing students with the opportunity to engage in transformative conversations.
12/1/24, 4:46 PM - Kirti Edoofa: We believe that interactions with such industry leaders can bring significant transformations to students' lives, enhancing their business acumen. Our Edoofians maximized this opportunity, having life-changing conversations with these influential figures. The main objective of the event was to emphasize the importance of thinking outside the box and encouraging students to believe in themselves and their dreams.
12/1/24, 4:46 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Hence, I wanted to reach out to you today to share a glimpse of the conference, and I hope you too are excited to attend such events when you come to India.

16/1/24, 3:04 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their A-Level results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey.
16/1/24, 3:04 PM - Kirti Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?
24/1/24, 4:58 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon parents and Takudzwa,

24/1/24, 9:39 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I would love to continue with our conversation however, given that it's been a long day for me, along with the conclusion of our working hours, let's plan to reconnect tomorrow to continue our discussion. I'm optimistic that you'll be able to connect then. Have a great night, and looking forward to our conversation tomorrow.
24/1/24, 10:06 PM - +263 78 953 1540: Thank you madam
24/1/24, 10:07 PM - +263 78 953 1540: Okay
25/1/24, 11:05 AM - +263 78 953 1540: Good morning ma'am
25/1/24, 1:10 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Takudzwa.

I hope you are doing well. With regard to our conversation yesterday since we were not able to move further with our discussion may I know if you are available to connect with us now so that we can continue with our discussion?
25/1/24, 1:10 PM - +263 78 953 1540: Yes ma'am, good afternoon to you too
25/1/24, 2:06 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that.  I trust you remember our last conversation, where we discussed the formalities the admission team was handling for your university admission. To ensure we are on the same page, let me recap what the team has been working on since then.

Following our last session, we submitted your application to multiple universities for scholarship consideration. However, as some time had passed without receiving any updates from the university officials, I personally took the initiative to inquire about the status of your application, which was submitted.
25/1/24, 2:06 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Upon requesting an update from the university officials, we learned that the eligibility criteria for the B.Tech (Civil Engineering) course had been revised in accordance with government guidelines for the August 2024 academic intake. While your documents were evaluated, the universities found you eligible for the scholarship. However, due to changes in government guidelines, you were not ineligible for the course B.Tech (Civil Engineering)
25/1/24, 2:07 PM - Kirti Edoofa: According to the updated eligibility criteria, students need to have studied Chemistry in their A-levels to pursue the B.Tech (Civil Engineering). Unfortunately, as you did not have the required subject, they indicated that you are currently ineligible for the program.
25/1/24, 2:07 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Since these updates, the team has been actively working to find a solution for you. We engaged in detailed discussions with the university officials to address this situation. As a team, our goal has been to ensure that you can pursue a course aligned with your career interests. 

With the grace of God, we were able to find a solution, and we would like to share the highlights of our discussion and the solutions we have explored for you. If we are together, shall I share the same solution with you?
25/1/24, 2:09 PM - +263 78 953 1540: Yes madam
25/1/24, 2:24 PM - Kirti Edoofa: After engaging in discussions with university officials and the academic board, we are pleased to inform you that we have identified a solution that not only allows you to pursue your desired course but also emphasizes the significance of selecting the right career path. 

The university officials highlighted that the foundational subjects for all engineering courses are the same in the first year of education. Recognizing the importance of helping you bridge the gap created by your initial subject combination, they assessed your eligibility for the course B.Tech Computer Science Engineering, which is highly sought-after in the 21st century.
25/1/24, 2:24 PM - Kirti Edoofa: As a result, you will embark on the journey of pursuing B.Tech Computer Science Engineering in your first year. If, in the second year, you decide to revert to your original course, you can do so by changing your major. Alternatively, should you discover a growing interest in Computer Science Engineering, you can seamlessly continue in that field.

We believe that this solution aligns with your career goals and will enable you to stay on track effectively. We wanted to share this update with you and are eager to hear your thoughts on this matter?
25/1/24, 2:27 PM - +263 78 953 1540: Okay, What other options do I have  besides Computer Science Engineering
25/1/24, 3:44 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @263789531540 may I know what other option are you interested in?
25/1/24, 3:49 PM - +263 78 953 1540: My other option were electrical engineering and Data Science
25/1/24, 4:02 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that @263789531540 let me tell you that your are indeed eligible for Electrical Engineering.
25/1/24, 4:06 PM - +263 78 953 1540: Okay ma'am,  so enroll me in electrical engineering
25/1/24, 4:19 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @263789531540 surely may I know if you would want me explain more about the course?
25/1/24, 4:20 PM - +263 78 953 1540: Yes Ma'am
25/1/24, 4:24 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Bachelor of Technology in Electrical Engineering* is a 4 years degree course. Electrical engineering is one of the most sought-after branches of engineering

There are two options available for them either they can join higher education after this course or they can join their professional career as per skills. At present, electrical engineers have great demand in the market.
 
An objective of this course is to ensure the success of the students for a long time. Students can develop their electrical skills and abilities with the study of this course. They also can improve abilities of professional attitude, effective communication skills as well.

I trust you are in good health. I apologize for not reaching out earlier due to the extended weekend, we were not available to connect with you. I am now ready and available to connect with you.

I extend my sincere condolences for your loss, and I hope you and your family can find the comfort and closure you need during this difficult time.
27/2/24, 8:13 PM - +263 78 318 4486: He is not dead,  he is not feeling well
27/2/24, 8:34 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for that, it was a message for one of my other student who lost one of his family members recently.
27/2/24, 8:34 PM - Kirti Edoofa: May I know what happened, how is he doing now?
27/2/24, 8:37 PM - +263 78 318 4486: Ok
27/2/24, 8:39 PM - +263 78 318 4486: He is now mentally disturbed
27/2/24, 8:40 PM - Kirti Edoofa: May I know what happened?
27/2/24, 8:41 PM - +263 78 318 4486: He is being assessed to see the cause
28/2/24, 8:24 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Takudzwa.

I hope you are doing well. I am sorry to hear that, however, may I know how did it all started?
28/2/24, 8:30 AM - +263 78 318 4486: Good morning ma'am 
 
 It started like malaria
28/2/24, 2:14 PM - +263 78 953 1540: Greetings ma'am, is this offer letter based on my O'level results or A'level results?
28/2/24, 2:14 PM - +263 78 953 1540: This message was deleted
28/2/24, 2:17 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings,  I hope you are doing well. 

Kindly excuse me for not connecting earlier, yes please the offer shared above is based on your A and O level results.
28/2/24, 2:20 PM - +263 78 953 1540: Okay ma'am, Do I have other offer letters which I can choose?
28/2/24, 3:08 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Let me address this query of yours by helping you understand how a student's university admission process is carried out.
28/2/24, 3:08 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Scholarship Program is a merit-based scholarship, and hence a student's application is shared with multiple universities that are recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board after considering a student's eligibility, along with the university's ranking and affordability.
28/2/24, 3:08 PM - Kirti Edoofa: After we share the application with the universities, it is on the admissions team of the university to accept or reject an application, and the decision to offer a scholarship depends on them. If you have any university on your mind, you can let me know and we will surely look into your inclinations as well.
28/2/24, 3:09 PM - Kirti Edoofa: As of now, your application has been only accepted by the Quest Group of Institutes and since we have shared your application with multiple universities, we are also hoping to receive updates from multiple universities. Once we get the same, we will surely inform you, but each university takes its own time to consider the application so you have to be patient while the universities are evaluating the application. 

I hope you are clear about this now?
28/2/24, 3:13 PM - +263 78 953 1540: Okay ma'am I understand
28/2/24, 3:16 PM - Kirti Edoofa: As you know that each university takes its own time to evaluate an application, In that case, if you wish to wait for an update from let us say University A and end up missing the opportunity given by Quest, you would lose out on the scholarship from Quest and won't be able to join it in the future. 

To help you with that, there is a transfer option available to the students. Are you aware of that?
28/2/24, 3:38 PM - +263 78 953 1540: yes ma'am
28/2/24, 3:40 PM - +263 78 953 1540: So what is the maximum period of time that I should wait to finally join university A not expecting other offer letters?
28/2/24, 4:05 PM - +263 78 953 1540: This message was deleted
28/2/24, 4:05 PM - +263 78 953 1540: This message was deleted
28/2/24, 4:06 PM - +263 78 953 1540: I had LPU and Chandigarh University on my mind
28/2/24, 4:17 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing that with me. 

We at Edoofa are filled with energy and excitement which has been fueled by the successful meet and greet sessions we hosted at the Martin Luther King Family of Schools, Harare last week. 

The entire Edoofa Team returned from Zimbabwe with a wealth of learnings, experiences, and opportunities for our students. Even before the team returned to India, we were already eagerly planning our next visit, spurred on by the incredible connections and opportunities we secured for the students of Zimbabwe.
28/2/24, 4:17 PM - Kirti Edoofa: However, before I get into our experiences and the opportunities that were provided to you and your family, I want to extend my sincere gratitude to you for being a part of the event and contributing to its success. 

I am also eager to hear about your experience at the meet and greet session. Whom were you able to connect with, and how do you envision your educational journey progressing from here?
28/2/24, 5:34 PM - +263 78 953 1540: It was a great experience
28/2/24, 9:11 PM - +263 78 953 1540: I had LPU and Chandigarh University on my mind
29/2/24, 8:14 PM - +263 78 953 1540: Greetings ma'am
4/3/24, 8:30 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Takudzwa

Please excuse our recent silence. I encountered an unfortunate situation that prevented me from connecting with the students. Additionally, the Team recently traveled to Zimbabwe to meet with our students, which kept us quite occupied. We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused.
4/3/24, 8:32 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that since you have mentioned two universities here. Let me inform you that since LPU is already one of our partnered universities we have shared your application there already and are waiting for updates from the same.
4/3/24, 8:33 AM - +263 78 953 1540: OKAY ma'am
4/3/24, 8:34 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Since you mentioned CU yourself I understand that it is easy for you to fall in love with what you see on the internet. I am sure with your research, you must have noticed that India is a country that has over 850 universities, and every university has its own eligibility criteria.
4/3/24, 8:34 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Now, it is practically impossible for us to apply to all these universities, so once the admission file of the student is ready, we handpick the university based on the ranking, its quality of education, its quality of teachers, practical exposure, etc. which actually would be a right fit for the students and then we share the application with them.

Now, if students have the same freedom, the only problem is that the information that the students receive is only from the internet and the internet is a place where everyone has the freedom to write and claim anything. You would often find that universities are mentioned as top universities, whereas in reality, it is not so.
4/3/24, 8:34 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Being Indians, we are connected with the Ministries, and Education Board where we have the rankings and information of the universities, and based on that we recommend. 

Whereas sometimes who is sitting 1000 miles away, the only source of information would be the internet and we do not want a situation where you later complain about the quality.
4/3/24, 8:34 AM - Kirti Edoofa: You know there was recently a case regarding the Chandigarh University girls' hostel and huge protests erupted after disturbing news emerged from the girl's hostel that private videos of several hostel girls were secretly recorded in the hostel bathroom and were circulated on the internet. 

I am sure being an outsider, you might not be familiar with it. When we know all this about the university and the management working there, there is no way we can ever think of partnering with such universities and sending our students over there. I hope you understand the same now?
4/3/24, 8:59 AM - +263 78 953 1540: Yes Madam
4/3/24, 9:06 AM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that you have understood well. Now that you are already aware of the transfer option, may I know when you plan to reserve your seat with the university since you were supposed to reserve your seat by paying $250 first on Wednesday as per your discussion with Ms. Vilsha?
4/3/24, 9:26 AM - +263 78 953 1540: Yes
4/3/24, 9:27 AM - Kirti Edoofa: @263789531540 so may I know by when do you plan to make the deposit of the same?
4/3/24, 9:30 AM - +263 78 953 1540: As soon as we get the money ma'am
4/3/24, 9:32 AM - +263 78 953 1540: We wanted to see if we could get another offer letter and compare with this one because it is a bit expensive with my father's condition
4/3/24, 12:14 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @263789531540 I completely understand that however, you need to understand that the university has to be fair to all the students, and if Ms. Vilsha was able to offer you a payment plan that is flexible for you it is because we understand the challenges, however, despite the payment plan offered to you you missed your deadline for the first $250 and you did not even communicate the reason to us on your own.
4/3/24, 12:15 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I do understand that, however, what will happen if the second letter you receive is not as per your expectations and you even miss the change to reserve your seat with this university as well?
4/3/24, 12:22 PM - +263 78 953 1540: I'll have to choose that regardless of my expectations
4/3/24, 12:35 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @263789531540 As I mentioned the university has to be fair with all the students and if you miss the chance to secure your seat with the Quest group of the institute the university shall revoke the scholarship they have offered to you and then at the end you will only be left with the second offer. However, if you reserve your seat right now you will have the option to transfer with the help of the transfer option.
4/3/24, 12:35 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you understand the transfer option better with an example as well - 

Let us say you have paid $1000 to Quest Group of Institutes to reserve your seat with the university and after that, you get a better offer from University A where your registration fee is again $1000.

If you wish to change your university to University A, in that case, one is to pay $1000, but because you would have already paid $1000 for Quest, the same amount would be adjusted against your fee of $1000 at University A and so you will not have to pay any other additional of money to reserve your scholarship seat with University or to change your university. 

I hope you are clear with this and have a better understanding?
4/3/24, 12:50 PM - +263 78 953 1540: No ma'am
4/3/24, 1:11 PM - Kirti Edoofa: May I know what concerns do you have now?
4/3/24, 1:15 PM - +263 78 953 1540: When I transfer, does my scholarship percentage remain the same or I should reapply for a scholarship?
6/3/24, 1:27 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Takudzwa.

I hope you are doing well. Kindly excuse me for not connecting with you earlier, as I was occupied with work that required my immediate attention, however, I am available to connect with you now. Coming to your concern shared above. No please you will not be reapplying for the scholarship and while you transfer no your scholarship will depend from university to university on what quantum of scholarship they offer however, stay assured it will not be below 50%.
6/3/24, 2:51 PM - +263 78 953 1540: Okay
8/3/24, 9:00 AM - +263 78 953 1540: Greetings Ma'am

8/3/24, 12:14 PM - +263 78 953 1540: No Ma'am I wanted to check whether if you had received my second application letter
