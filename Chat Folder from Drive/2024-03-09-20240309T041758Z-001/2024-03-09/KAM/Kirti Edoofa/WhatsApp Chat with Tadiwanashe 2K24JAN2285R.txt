5/2/24, 7:19 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That is great. Let us now discuss your university admission process. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts. I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them. 

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
5/2/24, 7:20 PM - +263 78 633 8964: Yes you can
5/2/24, 7:20 PM - +263 77 395 2774: Lets start
5/2/24, 7:21 PM - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
5/2/24, 7:23 PM - +263 78 633 8964: Go ahead
5/2/24, 7:31 PM - +263 77 395 2774: Done
5/2/24, 7:31 PM - +263 77 395 2774: My netwk is lagging behind you can move on I follow if I have any questions I will ask
5/2/24, 7:36 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
5/2/24, 7:36 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
5/2/24, 7:39 PM - +263 78 633 8964: Understood
5/2/24, 7:39 PM - +263 77 395 2774: Clear so far
5/2/24, 7:40 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
5/2/24, 7:40 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
5/2/24, 7:43 PM - +263 77 395 2774: On it
5/2/24, 7:43 PM - +263 78 633 8964: Still following
5/2/24, 7:44 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process, the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
5/2/24, 7:44 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
5/2/24, 7:47 PM - +263 78 633 8964: Got it
5/2/24, 7:50 PM - +263 77 395 2774: What is the time line for paying registration fee?
5/2/24, 7:51 PM - +263 77 395 2774: I mean how soon or what is the deadline for raising the university registration fee?
5/2/24, 7:57 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Please note that this is just a brief understanding of what your admission process holds, you will be explained each and every step in detail as we move forward, I would appreciate you being patient, please.

Now if we are clear shall we move ahead?
5/2/24, 8:10 PM - +263 77 395 2774: Lets move on
5/2/24, 8:11 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
5/2/24, 8:12 PM - +263 77 395 2774: Yes
5/2/24, 8:13 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
5/2/24, 8:13 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding until you are ready, shall we start with our discussion with me individually?
5/2/24, 8:23 PM - +263 78 633 8964: You may share

6/2/24, 1:21 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. Let me share my views as well so that it will help you expand your understanding.

*Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students:* In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. 

You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent.
6/2/24, 1:21 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s vision for you:* Here our founders talk about the most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
6/2/24, 1:21 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program:* Talking about the third video, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
6/2/24, 1:21 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP:* Another thing is that Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based. 

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
6/2/24, 1:28 PM - +263 78 633 8964: Noted
6/2/24, 1:30 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Brilliant, Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
6/2/24, 1:30 PM - +263 78 633 8964: Yes we are

``Question 2```
 . Soil fertility is the ability of a soil to sustain plant growth by providing essential plant nutrients and favorable  chemical, physical, and biological characteristics as a habitat for plant growth and soil biota.

The measurement of the fertility of soils is usually done by chemical analysis(soil and leaf analysis) or soil characterisation for essential plant nutrients such as nitrogen (N), potassium (K), phosphorus (P) and trace elements, organic matter as well as physical measurements of soil structure.

Improving soil fertility:
Soil fertility is the ability of soil to sustain plant growth and optimize crop yield. This can be improved through application of organic and inorganic fertilizers to the soil, adding organic matter to the soil, planting crops that release beneficial elements such as N to the soil (eg. Legumes)use of livestock manure,use of worms . Nuclear techniques provide data that enhances soil fertility and crop production while minimizing the environmental impact.
Legumes have long been recognized and valued as "soil building" crops. Growing legumes improves soil quality through their beneficial effects on soil biological, chemical and physical condition.
 ```Question 3```  Different  farming systems involve a vast amount of systems which may involve mixed farming involve growing two or more crops and rearing animals simultaneously.  Crops provide fodder crops to animals. Other farming systems involve plantation, sedentary, dairy and pastoral farming and many more.

 ```Question 4``` 
Pesticides are chemical compounds or biological entities that are used to kill, repel or suppress pests, such as insects, rodents, fungi and unwanted plants (weeds). Pesticides are also used in public health to kill vectors of disease, such as mosquitoes, and in agriculture to kill pests that damage crops.

Types of pesticides:
Fungicides: Control fungal pests of crop diseases caused by fungal pathogens
Herbicides Control weed pests
Insecticides: Control insect pests
Rodenticides: Control rodents
Arboricides: Control tree
Nematicides: Control nematode pests
Etc.

Risks of pesticides include:
Damage/destruction of wanted crop.
Residual persistence that affects susceptible crops in the rotation
Underground water and surface water contamination or pollution
Cause pest resistance build up.
Disturbs the natural ecosystem by eliminating other beneficial members of the ecosystem



 
```Question 5``` .Benefits of technology to farmers:
Prediction of rain season patterns
Yield prediction
Application of pesticides, fertilisers at best timing and optimum rates
Soil moisture prediction to calculate and program irrigation requirement
Harvest and or processing of field produce with quality grading
7/2/24, 9:30 AM - +263 78 633 8964: <Media omitted>
7/2/24, 12:21 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Tadiwanashe.

I hope you are doing well. Thank you for submitting your SOP, and the academic interview questions. It is well noted with us, and we have shared the same with the admissions team as well. They will now evaluate your response and will be proceeding to work on them so that your university application is well prepared.
7/2/24, 12:21 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Now with this, we have completed the second step of your university admission cycle, and hence we will move forward to the third step in your admission journey.*
7/2/24, 1:30 PM - +263 78 633 8964: Noted
7/2/24, 1:53 PM - Kirti Edoofa: To be on the same page, If I am correct, I believe you want to pursue a bachelor's degree in the course B.Sc (Agriculture) for your higher education in India as per the August 2024 intake?
7/2/24, 1:54 PM - +263 78 633 8964: Yes that's right
7/2/24, 1:58 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation. Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission* Are you ready to start with that?
7/2/24, 2:02 PM - +263 78 633 8964: Yes
7/2/24, 2:31 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
7/2/24, 2:31 PM - Kirti Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
7/2/24, 2:31 PM - Kirti Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
7/2/24, 2:31 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
7/2/24, 2:32 PM - +263 78 633 8964: Yes and received
7/2/24, 2:35 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
7/2/24, 2:35 PM - Kirti Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $1000. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
7/2/24, 2:35 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
7/2/24, 2:36 PM - +263 78 633 8964: Understood and noted
7/2/24, 2:36 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
7/2/24, 2:37 PM - +263 78 633 8964: Yes we are
7/2/24, 2:40 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:
7/2/24, 2:40 PM - Kirti Edoofa: 1. *Tuition Fee*: $1800 per annum
2. *Food and Accommodation Fee*: $1000 per annum 

*Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum*

Registration Fee to be paid: $1000 (deadline within two weeks of issue of the offer letter, part of the university’s first-year fee and will be adjusted against the first-year cost of education $2800). I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?
7/2/24, 2:43 PM - +263 78 633 8964: So what is the total fee for the whole year
7/2/24, 2:54 PM - Kirti Edoofa: As mentioned above in the example the annual fee will be within the range of $2000-$3000 only, and for reference you can consider the annual fee as $2800.
7/2/24, 2:55 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $1000, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $1000 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
7/2/24, 2:55 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $1000 = $1800. This amount can be paid in two installments of $900 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $900 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
7/2/24, 2:56 PM - +263 78 633 8964: Understood
7/2/24, 2:56 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
7/2/24, 2:56 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
7/2/24, 2:56 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
7/2/24, 2:58 PM - +263 78 633 8964: Understood
7/2/24, 2:58 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
7/2/24, 2:59 PM - +263 78 633 8964: No queries
7/2/24, 3:00 PM - +263 77 395 2774: Can you simplyfy your explanation here
7/2/24, 3:01 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Surely, may I know what would you like me to elaborate on?
7/2/24, 3:01 PM - +263 77 395 2774: If Tadiwanashe is accepted at a universirty today .How much are we supposed to pay and within how many days?
7/2/24, 3:03 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @263773952774 for now you only need to focus on the $1000 registration fee. This fee of $1000 is to be paid by the student/parent to reserve their scholarship seat with the university and it is not an additional cost, it is part of your first-year tuition fee which is paid while you are in your home country and it will be adjusted against your first year cost of education hence making your registration fee as zero.

I hope we are clear here?
7/2/24, 3:18 PM - +263 77 395 2774: How soon is it required
7/2/24, 3:34 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @263773952774 as we move ahead with the next step you doubt regarding the same will be cleared so may I know if you are ready to proceed ahead?
7/2/24, 5:22 PM - +263 77 395 2774: Lets move ahead
7/2/24, 6:08 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, Now with this, we are done with step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
7/2/24, 6:08 PM - Kirti Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one.

7/2/24, 8:49 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @263786338964 may I know if we are still connected with each other?
8/2/24, 12:11 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Tadiwanashe,

I trust you're well. I'm following up regarding the message I shared with you above. I was expecting a reply, but it seems my messages might not have been received.

Therefore, I'm reaching out today to check if you had a chance to review my previous message and to confirm if we are still in communication?
8/2/24, 12:12 PM - +263 78 633 8964: Yes were are noted
8/2/24, 12:30 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing, so may I know if you are ready to connect with us now?
8/2/24, 1:09 PM - +263 77 395 2774: Go ahead.
8/2/24, 1:12 PM - Kirti Edoofa: As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received special news for the students of the 2024 admission intake. May I know if you are excited to know the news we have for you?
8/2/24, 2:54 PM - +263 77 395 2774: Can you go on
8/2/24, 2:56 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Great. After speaking with thousands of students and parents who completed their admission process before you, we realized that the current economic situation in African countries makes it a bit challenging for parents to pay the full registration fee at once.
8/2/24, 2:56 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In response to the same challenge, we had a detailed discussion with the academic board and university official. As a result, we developed a solution to alleviate the financial burden of the parents specifically for the registration fee due of $500 to $1000. 

We at Edoofa are thrilled about this development, and I believe it will significantly help all of our students and their families. Are you aware of the solution?
8/2/24, 3:07 PM - +263 77 395 2774: I did not get you well on the question
8/2/24, 3:12 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @263773952774 may I know what exactly you want me to elaborate more about please?
8/2/24, 3:15 PM - +263 77 395 2774: You asked are you aware of the solution ?So maybe i should have said I dont know the solution for  you to answer me
8/2/24, 3:18 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright, let me share the same. With respect to the conversation we had with the academic board and the university officials, we requested them to allow the students to make the payment of their registration fee in two parts within a span of 45 days thereby reducing the financial pressure.
8/2/24, 3:18 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: Consider that your registration fee is $1000. After you will receive the offer letter, the first part of the registration fees which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, i.e. $500 needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university (For most of the universities 15 days). Subsequently, the second part of $500, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
8/2/24, 3:18 PM - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for February 15, 2024, and your registration fee stands at $1000, you'll need to make a payment of $500 on or before February 15, 2024. The remaining $500 should be paid by March 15, 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
8/2/24, 3:42 PM - +263 77 395 2774: Noted
8/2/24, 3:44 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. As Tadiwanashe's guardian, are you excited to initiate the process? For the current round of admissions, only 31 scholarship seats are available and hence let us begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the payment plan offered for the registration fee. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
8/2/24, 3:47 PM - +263 77 395 2774: Lets move on Iam following every step you can move I will ask where i have queries
8/2/24, 3:50 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to *evaluate your application* after which if they accept your application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
8/2/24, 4:00 PM - +263 77 395 2774: Ok noted .will be waiting for the response.Thank you
