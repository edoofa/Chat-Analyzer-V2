21/12/23, 7:03 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Along with these forms, I have asked you to share your academic documents with us. I am currently waiting for that we well.

Moving forward, as a part of your application file, you will need to visit your school and secure a letter of recommendation from them. We have attached a sample document to help guide you through the process.
21/12/23, 7:03 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Here are some key points to consider when requesting the letter from your school:

1. *Visit Your School*: Approach your school administration or the designated authority for issuing such letters.

2. *Provide Necessary Information*: Ensure that the drafted letter includes essential details such as your identity as a student of the school, your subject combination for A Level exams, and your intention to sit for the exams this academic year.

3. *Printing and Signing*: Request the school to print the letter on official letterhead and have it signed/stamped by the appropriate authority.

4. *Include Authority Details*: Ensure that the letter contains the details of the signing authority, including their full name, contact number, and email ID.
21/12/23, 7:03 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: This letter of recommendation is a crucial document that will support your application process. The Edoofa Academic Board will use those details to reach out to your school authorities and verify the recommendation letter before adding it to your scholarship application and hence I would like to enquire by when will you be able to share the same document with us?
21/12/23, 7:15 PM - +263 71 596 3939: Ummmm ,  I think for this one you may give me some time , so that I can talk to the school authority

21/12/23, 8:04 PM - +263 71 596 3939: I am sure I'll talk to them on Monday
21/12/23, 8:24 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Very well, I shall wait on the same.

28/12/23, 9:37 PM - +263 71 596 3939: Okae sir
29/12/23, 6:13 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening!

I hope you are doing well today. May I know if you are currently available to proceed with the session for the admission process?
29/12/23, 6:54 PM - +263 71 596 3939: Good evening sir
29/12/23, 6:54 PM - +263 71 596 3939: I am ready Sir
29/12/23, 7:50 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
29/12/23, 7:50 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
29/12/23, 7:57 PM - +263 71 596 3939: Yes sir
29/12/23, 7:58 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa share their recommendations and insights from their 13+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
29/12/23, 7:58 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
29/12/23, 8:00 PM - +263 71 596 3939: Ok sir go on
29/12/23, 8:02 PM - +263 71 596 3939: Yes sir
29/12/23, 8:02 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
29/12/23, 8:02 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
29/12/23, 8:04 PM - +263 71 596 3939: Yes sir they are clear
29/12/23, 8:23 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?

29/1/24, 5:27 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad that your day has been going well. Based on our previous interaction, you had confirmed that you went through the founders' message successfully. Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  I hope you were able to follow through with this?
29/1/24, 5:38 PM - +263 71 596 3939: Yaàah I followed it mam
29/1/24, 5:52 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: As much as I would like to continue with our discussion, since my operational hours for the day have already concluded, I would like to reconnect with you tomorrow at our scheduled time to further discuss the Financial Secure Plan and admission process. Until then, please take care and have a blessed day ahead!
30/1/24, 4:11 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Ashley.

I hope everything is well on your end. I was hoping to get a response from your end yesterday, but it seems like due to some reason we were unable to connect. However I am glad that we can reconnect today. Before we proceed with our discussion, I would like to check in on you and your family. How are you all doing today?

30/1/24, 5:13 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the task by tomorrow before our session.
30/1/24, 5:13 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This message was deleted
30/1/24, 5:13 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

31/1/24, 1:36 PM - +263 71 596 3939: <Media omitted>
31/1/24, 4:19 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Ashley. I hope you are having a wonderful day. How are you all doing today?
31/1/24, 4:20 PM - +263 71 596 3939: I'm fine mam , how are u too

Thank you for sharing the screenshot with me. With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey, i.e. *Introduction to Financial Secure Plan*.
31/1/24, 4:58 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Let us move forward with our discussion. To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is B.Sc (Cardiovascular Technology) and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2025. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
31/1/24, 4:59 PM - +263 71 596 3939: Yes that's true mam
1/2/24, 4:51 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Ashley.

I was unable to respond to your message last night as our operational hours had concluded. Before we proceed with our discussion, how are you all doing today?
1/2/24, 4:56 PM - +263 77 690 4354: Good afternoon mam
1/2/24, 4:56 PM - +263 71 596 3939: I'm fine mam how are you
2/2/24, 4:22 PM - +263 71 596 3939: Good afternoon mam
2/2/24, 4:37 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Ashley.

I hope you are having a wonderful day. Kindly excuse me for not being able to respond to your message last night as our team is currently working tirelessly towards the preparation of our upcoming Zimbabwe trip in the month of February. Before we proceed with our discussion, I would like to ask how are you doing today?
2/2/24, 4:47 PM - +263 71 596 3939: I am fine mam , how about you
2/2/24, 4:52 PM - +263 71 596 3939: <Media omitted>
2/2/24, 5:17 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that Ashley. I am fine too, thank you for asking. Mr. Rithvik is the HOD of the DSW department of Edoofa. Our team is currently preparing for the upcoming Zimbabwe trip in the month of February, and he has reached out to you to share some details regarding the same.
2/2/24, 5:19 PM - +263 71 596 3939: Okay okay mam for letting me know..
2/2/24, 5:51 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: You are most welcome Ashley. During our previous conversation, you had confirmed your course and year of intake.
2/2/24, 5:51 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. Based on our experience of over 14 years and having assisted over 5000 students from different countries, we have realized that financial planning is the most important factor when a student plans for their higher education abroad.
2/2/24, 5:51 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am sure that you must be aware that 20-30% of students who are admitted into universities abroad are unable to fulfill their dream and come to India due to a lack of financial planning. The funds needed for booking flights, accommodation, and covering living expenses after arrival often become overwhelming, leading to the decision to defer their admission for a year. This, in turn, creates a gap in the child's education.
2/2/24, 5:51 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: To assist both students and parents in this regard, Edoofa Management has designed a Financial Secure Plan that aims to help you prepare for your higher educational finances without experiencing stress or last-minute rushes. I believe you must be wondering about the details of the same plan and how it helps the parents?
2/2/24, 5:57 PM - +263 71 596 3939: Yaah sure mam
2/2/24, 7:51 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Edoofa Secure Plan is important for parents who have children joining the university for tertiary education in the next one to two years for several reasons:
2/2/24, 7:51 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 1. *Financial Preparedness:* The Edoofa Secure plan helps parents prepare financially for the costs after the Scholarship being offered so that they are not caught off guard.

2. *Reduced Financial Stress:* Having the Edoofa Secure Plan in place can significantly reduce the financial stress on you as parents when your child is about to enter university. Knowing that there is a dedicated fund for education expenses provides peace of mind.
2/2/24, 7:51 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 3. *Avoiding Debt*: Without proper savings, some parents may resort to taking out loans or accumulating credit card debt to cover their child's education costs. This Educational savings plan helps avoid the burden of debt and high-interest payments.

4. *Compound Interest:* By starting to save early and consistently contributing to the savings plan, parents can take advantage of compound interest, which can significantly increase the amount available for education expenses.
2/2/24, 7:51 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 5. *Flexibility and Control:* The Edoofa Secure savings plans allow parents to have greater control over their finances and how they allocate funds for their child's education. They can choose investment options that align with their risk tolerance and financial goals.

6. *Encouraging Responsibility*: Involving your child in the process of saving for their education teaches them financial responsibility and the value of higher education. It also motivates them to outperform in Academics.
2/2/24, 7:51 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 7. *Adapting to Unexpected Changes*: Life is full of surprises, and circumstances can change especially when there are political reforms changing each day impacting the Local Currency. Having an Edoofa Secure Plan allows parents to adapt to unexpected changes in their financial situation while still prioritizing their child's education.

8. *Peace of Mind:* Overall, having the Edoofa Secure plan provides parents with peace of mind, knowing that they are actively planning for their child's future and increasing the likelihood of providing them with a solid education.
2/2/24, 7:51 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, when you go through all the above benefits, I am sure you can see that the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan is an important financial tool for parents/students who are supposed to enter the university soon. 

It helps ensure that the financial aspect of tertiary education is well-managed, reduces stress, and allows parents to provide the best opportunities for their children without resorting to debt or financial hardship. Isn't this something you and your family also wish to have?
2/2/24, 7:52 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Since our operational hours have concluded and I have had a long day already, let us conclude our conversation on this note. Kindly go through the above points and we will reconnect tomorrow to continue with our discussion about the Financial Secure Plan.

I wish you a blessed night!
3/2/24, 9:58 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Ashley. How are you all doing this fine morning?
3/2/24, 12:52 PM - +263 71 596 3939: Iam fine mam how are you too
3/2/24, 12:53 PM - +263 71 596 3939: Yaah sure thing, I also wish to have it
3/2/24, 1:12 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. I am fine too, thank you for asking.
3/2/24, 1:12 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through the above points, do you want me to help you understand how the Edoofa Secure Plan works?
3/2/24, 3:13 PM - +263 71 596 3939: Yes you can go on
5/2/24, 4:08 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Ashley.

I hope you all had a great weekend. I was unable to respond to your last text as our operational hours on Saturdays are from 8:00 AM to 1:00 PM. Before we proceed with our discussion, I would like to ask how is everything on your end today?
5/2/24, 4:54 PM - +263 71 596 3939: I'm fine mam , and how are you too
5/2/24, 4:54 PM - +263 71 596 3939: Sorry for late reply mam
5/2/24, 5:27 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. I am fine too, thank you for asking. During our previous conversation, we were about to discuss how the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan works. Allow me to proceed with it -
5/2/24, 5:27 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: As you are aware, we are currently in February 2024, and we have a good 20 months to plan for your finances before you start your university education in 2025.
5/2/24, 5:27 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: During the counseling session, you were informed that at Edoofa, we guarantee a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship on the tuition fees. Hence, the cost of education, including food and accommodation after the scholarship, would be between $2000-$3000, and it could be even less. Not more than that.
5/2/24, 5:27 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This means that if you can save $150 per month for the next 20 months, you will be able to save $3000. This amount is more than enough for the first year of university fees, including tuition fees (if any), food, and accommodation. I hope you agree with this?
5/2/24, 5:30 PM - +263 71 596 3939: Yes mam I agree <This message was edited>
5/2/24, 5:43 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. I would love to continue with our discussion about the Financial Secure Plan, however, my operational hours for the day have concluded and I have had a long day already. Let us conclude our conversation here and we will reconnect tomorrow at our scheduled time to further discuss the Financial Secure Plan.

Have a blessed day ahead!
5/2/24, 5:50 PM - +263 71 596 3939: Thank you mam , have a great day
6/2/24, 4:00 PM - +263 71 596 3939: Good afternoon mam , there's this document that I'm supposed to send hear , from my school's authority, but the School director is asking for more clarity on what exactly are you expecting to see in this form
6/2/24, 4:08 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Ashley.

I hope you are all doing wonderful today. I understand please. Which document are you talking about?
6/2/24, 4:23 PM - +263 71 596 3939: The recommendation letter
6/2/24, 4:44 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: We have attached a sample document to help guide you through the process.
6/2/24, 4:44 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
6/2/24, 4:44 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Here are some key points to consider when requesting the letter from your school:

1. *Visit Your School*: Approach your school administration or the designated authority for issuing such letters.

2. *Provide Necessary Information*: Ensure that the drafted letter includes essential details such as your identity as a student of the school, *your subject combination for A Level exams*, and your intention to sit for the exams this academic year.

3. *Printing and Signing*: Request the school to print the letter on official letterhead and have it signed/stamped by the appropriate authority.

4. *Include Authority Details*: Ensure that the letter contains the details of the signing authority, including their full name, contact number, and email ID.
6/2/24, 5:00 PM - +263 71 596 3939: Well thanks mam
6/2/24, 5:13 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: You are most welcome.

Have a great evening!
6/2/24, 5:15 PM - +263 71 596 3939: I wish the same to you.....
7/2/24, 11:21 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Ashley

I hope this message finds you well and filled with the same excitement that's buzzing here at Edoofa! It's that time of the year again when we eagerly anticipate our annual Meet and Greet Seminar in Harare. This event holds a special place in our hearts as it brings us closer to our community, and we're counting down the days with great anticipation!
7/2/24, 11:21 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Just like clockwork, we're gearing up for the seminar next week, and I couldn't resist sharing our enthusiasm with you. Your presence would truly make the event all the more meaningful, guiding you on your journey to India. Hence, with immense joy, we wanted to extend the special invitation for the Meet and Greet Seminar to you and your wonderful family.
7/2/24, 11:21 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: And in the process of doing the same, I happened to notice that you haven't started your EWYL Program by now. In light of this, I had a discussion with Ms. Sanjana, the head of the EWYL Department, and I am happy to share that she has graciously agreed to make a special exception for you, expediting your application process.
7/2/24, 11:21 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: As a result, I have gone ahead and created your very own dedicated EWYL Group - *Ashley EWYL23E0990*, adding both you and your parents to the mix. If I have missed including any other family members, they can easily join using the following link: [https://chat.whatsapp.com/I7u0pyo6H6M5S2cv6P779B].

Within the group, the EWYL team will not only guide you on the hows and whens of the EWYL Program but also share all the exciting details about the upcoming Meet and Greet Seminar in Harare. We are genuinely thrilled to witness you embark on this transformative journey, and we are rooting for your success every step of the way!

Warmest regards,
Admissions Team.
7/2/24, 3:54 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon once again Parents and Ashley.

We are scheduled to commence our session for today now. May I know if you were able to go through my previous messages?
7/2/24, 5:17 PM - +263 71 596 3939: Good afternoon mam, I was a bit busy with school work today , I'm sorry
7/2/24, 5:46 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. In such a case, kindly let me know beforehand so that I can reschedule our sessions accordingly. Since my operational hours have already concluded, let us reconnect tomorrow at our scheduled time to continue with our discussion.

Have a blessed evening!
8/2/24, 4:16 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Ashley.

I hope you are all doing wonderful today. How has your day been going so far?
8/2/24, 4:56 PM - +263 71 596 3939: I'm fine mam how are you
8/2/24, 5:32 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. During our previous sessions, we were discussing about how the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan works. Allow me to proceed with our discussion -
8/2/24, 5:32 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: With the planning, by the time you would be in India, you would have already saved the $3000 that will cover the first-year fee.
8/2/24, 5:32 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, in these next 20 months, I am sure you would also be engaged in the EWYL program, and if you secure a minimum of $1000 in 20 months, that means the fees for 1.5 years are already secured.
8/2/24, 5:32 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, for a 3-year course, if we follow the same approach for the remaining 1.5 years, the educational journey for the student and the financial journey for the parent will be easy and smooth. I believe you must be able to see this perspective?
8/2/24, 6:14 PM - +263 71 596 3939: Sure mam
9/2/24, 3:33 PM - +263 71 596 3939: <Media omitted>
9/2/24, 3:33 PM - +263 71 596 3939: Good afternoon mam
9/2/24, 4:05 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Ashley.

I hope that you are having a wonderful day. How are things with you today?
9/2/24, 4:06 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the LOR with me. I have duly taken a note of it and will update your application profile accordingly.
9/2/24, 4:15 PM - +263 71 596 3939: All fine Mam
9/2/24, 4:15 PM - +263 71 596 3939: How about you
12/2/24, 4:18 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Ashley.

I hope you all had a wonderful weekend. Kindly excuse me for not being able to respond to your last message as our team is currently occupied with the upcoming Meet and Greet Seminar to be held in Harare later this week. Before we proceed with our discussion, may I know how is everything on your end today?
12/2/24, 4:55 PM - +263 77 690 4354: good after mam how are you
12/2/24, 4:59 PM - +263 71 596 3939: I'm fine mam , how are you too
12/2/24, 5:20 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that everything is well on your end. I am doing good, thank you for asking. During our previous session, we were discussing about the various constraints that the students and parents tend to face while planning for their higher education journey. <This message was edited>
12/2/24, 5:20 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Considering these constraints, Edoofa Management has decided to help the parents and students prepare for the journey way ahead of time by helping them save money with Edoofa without any additional charges but rather saving additional money as well. Do you want me to explain how this has been achieved?
12/2/24, 5:23 PM - +263 71 596 3939: Yaah you can go on
12/2/24, 5:35 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Program Fee (Enrollment Fee) that you were asked to pay is $350. Under the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan, a parent has to deposit a small amount of money which is $150 every month for the next 10 months. That means, in 10 months, the money saved will be $1500.
12/2/24, 5:36 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That means, in 10 months, the money saved will be $1500. When this money is saved, Edoofa will waive off $150 from the Edoofa Program/Enrollment Fee of $350, thereby making a straight saving of $150 in 10 months.
12/2/24, 5:36 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Imagine you paying $15 every month to the Bank of Zimbabwe to keep your money safe, and here Edoofa is paying you $15 every month to keep your money safe. Now, you must be wondering, why only for 10 months and not for 20 months, right?
12/2/24, 5:47 PM - +263 71 596 3939: Yaaah xua
12/2/24, 5:55 PM - +263 77 690 4354: yes it is sounding so helpfull
12/2/24, 6:05 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: If you see the bigger picture, you will realize that the reason is quite simple. Upon the completion of the 10 installments, the Edoofa Admissions team will initiate the Child’s Admission Process by applying early to the universities to secure their scholarship and their university seat.
12/2/24, 6:05 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Reserving seats earlier increases the chances of obtaining a maximum scholarship. A higher scholarship means lower fees, and by securing the seat, you will be entitled to pay the fees as per the old fee structure of the university, not the new one implemented in January 2025. Furthermore, when applying to the universities, you will receive an offer letter or a letter of intent detailing the fees, scholarship, and registration fees.
12/2/24, 6:05 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: As explained during the enrollment process, the registration fee is a portion of your first-year university fee, paid to reserve the seat. It ranges from $500-$1000 and is not an additional fee. 

From the $1500 you saved with Edoofa, the registration fee will be paid to the university, securing the seat. For instance, if the registration fee is $1000, Edoofa will pay $1000 from the $1500 saved in 10 months. The updated balance with Edoofa will be $500, which will be paid to the university upon your arrival in India.
12/2/24, 6:05 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This eases the financial burden on the parent, as there is no immediate payment required upon the student's arrival. The $500 saved will cover the remaining fees for the semester/year, as specified in the offer letter from the university. What are your thoughts on this?
12/2/24, 6:18 PM - +263 77 690 4354: as a parent i dont any problem it is good
13/2/24, 9:36 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Ashley,

I hope you are doing great. I am pleased to hear that we are together so far in our discussion. Before we proceed, I would like to check in and ask how your day has been going?
13/2/24, 10:28 AM - +263 77 690 4354: good morning mam we are doing well
13/2/24, 10:50 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. During our previous discussion, we were talking about how the Financial Secure Plan eases the burden on students and parents. With this plan for the next 10 months, I am sure you must be wondering what will happen in the next 10 months, considering you have already secured your scholarship seat with the university due to your hard work in the first 10 months. Is my understanding correct?
13/2/24, 11:14 AM - +263 77 690 4354: Yes mam you thats correct
13/2/24, 11:26 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Let me help you with that as well. In the 11th month, you will be guided to open an FBC Mastercard bank account in Zimbabwe with a deposit of $150. The reason for this is that when you apply for your student Visa, the Embassy asks for a Bank Statement, and this account will serve that purpose.
13/2/24, 11:26 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: We understand it might be expensive if you deposit another $1500 for the remaining 10 months in FB  Bank Zimbabwe, so to avoid the same challenges, we have designed the plan accordingly. You will only be depositing for the 11th, 12th, 13th, and 14th month, which is 4 months.
13/2/24, 11:26 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Once the 4 months are completed, our Department of Student Welfare (DSW) team will assist you with your visa process. The bank statement will act as one of the required documents, and once you receive the visa, you can withdraw the amount from FBC and book the flight ticket. This will help you utilize the money as well. How does it sound?
13/2/24, 11:43 AM - +263 77 690 4354: Yaa it sounds good sure ,shall the FBC account in parent”s name or in Ashelys name
13/2/24, 12:22 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: It is advisable if the account is under Ashley's name, as it will help in her visa process as well. 

Now, from the 16th Month till the 20th month, considering it is a 6-month window, you can again continue depositing the money ($150) with Edoofa which can be used in the fee as and when required or you can decide to save this $900 of these 6 months with you as well. This is something which you are free to choose. I hope you have understood the financial secure plan now?
13/2/24, 12:38 PM - +263 77 690 4354: Yes mam i am understanding what you are explaining
13/2/24, 12:41 PM - +263 77 690 4354: May i know here mam shall we use the same account that we deposited the enrollment fee
13/2/24, 12:42 PM - +263 77 690 4354: On this one
13/2/24, 1:27 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Based on our records, it appears that you previously utilized Mr. Shorwi's FBC account for your deposit.

Additionally, once we've finalized the formalities, we'll present you with alternative payment options, allowing you to select your preferred method.
13/2/24, 1:27 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now that you have all the information, I want you to take some time and discuss the financial security plan with your family members. Help them understand its importance and details. Once you're done, we can reconnect, have a discussion, and address any queries you may have. After resolving your concerns, I'll guide you through starting your financial security plan. 

While most people can discuss this with their family the same day, I understand everyone is different. Could you let me know when you think you'll have the discussion with your family? This way, we can schedule our next session accordingly.
13/2/24, 1:34 PM - +263 77 690 4354: i am sure today we can discuss and finish

Wishing you a good day ahead, and please extend our regards to your family.
