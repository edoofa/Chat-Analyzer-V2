9/1/24, 9:49 PM - Dev Edoofa: Before we get into the specifics of your admission journey and talk about your admission process, I would like to share an exciting milestone that India as a country achieved within the first week of 2024 – the successful India's Chandrayaan-3 Engine Test. This accomplishment is responsible for the third lunar mission, aiming to land a rover on the Moon's south polar region and conduct scientific studies that could check Moon's viability to sustain life.

I want to take advantage of every opportunity to gain knowledge and experience, and to grow as a person.

Ultimately, I want to set myself up for success in my future career.
13/1/24, 10:05 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am delighted to hear that you want to become a better version of yourself by equipping new skills related to your field.

However, since you are going to be occupied with school and your parents are occupied with work during the day, it seems that the same challenge in connectivity is going to persist for the next couple of months as well.
13/1/24, 10:05 AM - Dev Edoofa: With that being said, what I can do right now to solve this constraint is give you the freedom to choose the time slot for our sessions over the next 10 days [till 20th January].

I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them.

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
29/1/24, 4:28 PM - +263 77 433 8228: Yes we can
29/1/24, 4:35 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/1/24, 4:52 PM - +263 77 433 8228: I have gone through the picture which explains the university admission cycle
29/1/24, 5:24 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
29/1/24, 5:24 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
29/1/24, 9:19 PM - +263 77 433 8228: Crystal clear
30/1/24, 3:33 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Tafuma. I hope everything is well on your end. How are you all doing today?
31/1/24, 8:20 AM - +263 77 433 8228: Good morning Mam we are all doing well how about you?
31/1/24, 9:41 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Tafuma. I hope you are all doing well today. I am fine too, thank you for asking. May I know if you were able to follow the details of the first 2 steps that I shared with you day before yesterday?
31/1/24, 10:18 AM - +263 77 433 8228: Yes i understood
31/1/24, 10:43 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for confirming that. That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps - 

*Step 3: Introduction to the Financial Secure Plan* - Parents with children embarking on their university journey within the next one to two years face important decision-making and rigorous financial planning. Edoofa recognizes the significance of this transition and hence has introduced the Edoofa Secure Plan - a unique and systematic strategy to empower parents in financial planning and preparing for their child's tertiary education well in advance.
31/1/24, 10:44 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Scholarship Offer Letter from the university would be issued next year in the month of August.

I hope you are following?
31/1/24, 10:45 AM - +263 77 433 8228: Yes im following
31/1/24, 10:46 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. The registration fee will be paid through the savings you have accumulated visa the Financial Secure Plan. After the registration fee is paid, for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
31/1/24, 10:46 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
31/1/24, 10:47 AM - +263 77 433 8228: Crystal clear Mam
31/1/24, 11:01 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through all 6 steps, if we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
31/1/24, 11:02 AM - +263 77 433 8228: Yes please
31/1/24, 11:04 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
31/1/24, 11:04 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding. Until you are ready, shall we start with our discussion with me individually? 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
31/1/24, 11:16 AM - +263 77 433 8228: Yes please
31/1/24, 11:52 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection. 

Please go through the 4 videos, our next session will be scheduled for tomorrow after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarize your understanding. Hence I would like to know by when do you think you will be able to go through these videos so that we can schedule our next session accordingly?

AFFORDABLE QUALITY EDUCATION AND MAKING THEM EMPLOYABLE， EDOOFA’S VISION IS ALSO EMBARKING ON INCREASING ‘S CAPACITY FOR SUCCESS

*ALSO STUDENTS SHOULD BE DILIGENT IN FILLING OUT THE STATEMENT OF PURPOSE ，AS IT IS AN ESSENTIAL DOCUMENT。
7/3/24, 1:56 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. Let me share my views as well so that it will help you expand your understanding.

*Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students:* In the first video, the founders of Edoofa highlight the promising journey awaiting new Edoofians, citing examples of scholarship beneficiaries who've transformed their lives in India. These students, now living their dreams, exude satisfaction beyond gratitude towards Edoofa, attending classes confidently and garnering praise from peers. Mr. Angad shares insights from his Africa visit, identifying high-potential individuals aligned with Edoofa's vision. He underscores the importance of an open-minded, resilient attitude, illustrated by an anecdote about Steve Jobs' resourcefulness.

The video emphasizes the significance of following instructions and maintaining openness as Edoofians embark on their journey. You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent.
7/3/24, 1:56 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s vision for you:* In the second video, the founders elaborate on Edoofa's vision, plans, and goals tailored for students, emphasizing the importance of an open-minded approach. He recounts a poignant story of a Ghanaian student who faced obstacles in pursuit of higher education, shedding light on the challenges many encounter in navigating the system.

Despite setbacks, Edoofa stands as a beacon of support, offering scholarships, affordable education, and an "Earn While You Learn" initiative, exemplified by Tiriwashe's scholarship credits covering his semester tuition. Success requires more than past grades; it demands a positive attitude, adherence to protocols, and openness to guidance. He encourages students to comprehend and embrace the guidance provided by Edoofa, transforming one's capacity for success from a cup to a tank in the vast ocean of opportunities.
7/3/24, 1:56 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program:* In the third video, the founders emphasize the importance of watching the videos as preparation for Step 5 of the Edoofa Cycle, the University Interaction. He unveils the behind-the-scenes effort, highlighting ten years of hard work invested in creating robust systems and platforms to support student success. Despite only seeing the tip of the iceberg, students benefit from a wealth of resources aimed at helping them excel academically and achieve their dreams.

Additionally, they assure students of Edoofa's commitment to ethical university selection, prioritizing accreditation, faculty qualifications, and English-language instruction to ensure a quality educational experience. Moreover, he stresses the importance of employability, noting the inclusion of the "Earn While You Learn" program to provide practical skills alongside academic knowledge, ultimately preparing students for success in their future careers.
7/3/24, 1:56 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP:* In the fourth video, the founders talk about how Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based. 

Additionally, the founders delve into the significance of the Statement of Purpose (SOP) in the admissions process, emphasizing its role as a personalized narrative showcasing students' skills, accomplishments, and ambitions. The SOP serves as a platform for students to articulate their motivations for pursuing a specific course, their aspirations for admission, and the unique contributions they can offer to the institution. Through these insights, students are equipped to present themselves as well-rounded individuals with a clear vision for their academic and professional journey.
7/3/24, 1:56 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now once you are able to go through these summaries of the videos, we will have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will be moving forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  I hope you were able to follow through with this?
7/3/24, 2:06 PM - +263 77 844 0650: yes Mam
7/3/24, 2:07 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Glad to hear that. Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by tomorrow before our session.
7/3/24, 2:07 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

7/3/24, 2:32 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand that you are yet to sit for your A-Level examinations. In such a case, as a part of your application file, you will need to visit your school and secure a letter of recommendation from them. We have attached a sample document to help guide you through the process.
7/3/24, 2:33 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
7/3/24, 2:33 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Here are some key points to consider when requesting the letter from your school:

1. *Visit Your School*: Approach your school administration or the designated authority for issuing such letters.

2. *Provide Necessary Information*: Ensure that the drafted letter includes essential details such as your identity as a student of the school, *your subject combination for A Level exams*, and your intention to sit for the exams this academic year.

4. *Include Authority Details*: Ensure that the letter contains the details of the signing authority, including their full name, contact number, and email ID.
7/3/24, 2:33 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This letter of recommendation is a crucial document that will support your application process. The Edoofa Academic Board will use those details to reach out to your school authorities and verify the recommendation letter before adding it to your scholarship application and hence I would like to inquire by when will you be able to share the letter of recommendation and the rest of the documents with us?
7/3/24, 2:45 PM - +263 77 844 0650: 12 March

I hope you are having a lovely day. I would like to begin by wishing a Happy International Women's Day to all the incredible women in your family and around the world! May you continue to inspire, empower, and thrive in all aspects of life.

Before we proceed with our discussion, I would like to check in on you and your family. How is everything on your end today?
8/3/24, 2:14 PM - +263 77 844 0650: Thank you Mam 。。Everything is good
8/3/24, 2:37 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. During our previous session, I had shared two tasks with you - Online SOP form and Academic Interview Questions. May I know if you were able to complete these tasks that we discussed yesterday? <This message was edited>
8/3/24, 2:38 PM - +263 77 844 0650: im still working on them <This message was edited>
8/3/24, 2:38 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand Tafuma. Could you kindly let me know by when you will be able to complete the same?
8/3/24, 2:39 PM - +263 77 844 0650: im having internet problems but I'm trying my best
8/3/24, 2:41 PM - +263 77 844 0650: on Monday
8/3/24, 2:55 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand Tafuma. In the meantime, let us move forward with our discussion and progress to the third step in your admission journey, i.e. *Introduction to Financial Secure Plan*.
8/3/24, 2:56 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: However, before we start the same, I was going through your scholarship application file and noticed that you are supposed to make the payment of your remaining part of Edoofa Enrollment fee. Hence, I thought of sharing a gentle reminder with you and trying to understand how your preparation has been so far? Have you been able to align your preparations in the right direction?
8/3/24, 2:59 PM - +263 77 844 0650: I finished paying the enrollment fee before the due date。And we sent the  evidence in the group
8/3/24, 3:00 PM - +263 77 844 0650: Unfortunately since i lost my phone 。I no longer have the transactions 。but my  sessions continued after l finished paying。
8/3/24, 3:03 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Alright please, thank you for letting me know that. I will confirm your payment from the accounts team and share an update with you. In the meantime, Let us move forward with our discussion. To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is B.Tech (Computer Science Engineering) and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2025. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
8/3/24, 3:04 PM - +263 77 844 0650: Accurate。if everything goes well
8/3/24, 3:13 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. Based on our experience of over 14 years and having assisted over 5000 students from different countries, we have realised that financial planning is the most important factor when a student plans for their higher education abroad.
8/3/24, 3:13 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am sure that you must be aware that 20-30% of students who are admitted into universities abroad are unable to fulfil their dream and come to India due to a lack of financial planning. The funds needed for booking flights, accommodation, and covering living expenses after arrival often become overwhelming, leading to the decision to defer their admission for a year. This, in turn, creates a gap in the child's education.
8/3/24, 3:13 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: To assist both students and parents in this regard, Edoofa Management has designed a Financial Secure Plan that aims to help you prepare for your higher educational finances without experiencing stress or last-minute rushes. I believe you must be wondering about the details of the same plan and how it helps the parents?
8/3/24, 3:19 PM - +263 77 844 0650: Yes please
8/3/24, 3:22 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Edoofa Secure Plan is important for parents who have children joining the university for tertiary education in the next one to two years for several reasons:
8/3/24, 3:22 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 1. *Financial Preparedness:* The Edoofa Secure plan helps parents prepare financially for the costs after the Scholarship being offered so that they are not caught off guard.

2. *Reduced Financial Stress:* Having the Edoofa Secure Plan in place can significantly reduce the financial stress on you as parents when your child is about to enter university. Knowing that there is a dedicated fund for education expenses provides peace of mind.
8/3/24, 3:22 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 3. *Avoiding Debt*: Without proper savings, some parents may resort to taking out loans or accumulating credit card debt to cover their child's education costs. This Educational savings plan helps avoid the burden of debt and high-interest payments.

4. *Compound Interest:* By starting to save early and consistently contributing to the savings plan, parents can take advantage of compound interest, which can significantly increase the amount available for education expenses.
8/3/24, 3:22 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 5. *Flexibility and Control:* The Edoofa Secure savings plans allow parents to have greater control over their finances and how they allocate funds for their child's education. They can choose investment options that align with their risk tolerance and financial goals.

6. *Encouraging Responsibility*: Involving your child in the process of saving for their education teaches them financial responsibility and the value of higher education. It also motivates them to outperform in Academics.
8/3/24, 3:22 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 7. *Adapting to Unexpected Changes*: Life is full of surprises, and circumstances can change especially when there are political reforms changing each day impacting the Local Currency. Having an Edoofa Secure Plan allows parents to adapt to unexpected changes in their financial situation while still prioritizing their child's education.

8. *Peace of Mind:* Overall, having the Edoofa Secure plan provides parents with peace of mind, knowing that they are actively planning for their child's future and increasing the likelihood of providing them with a solid education.
8/3/24, 3:22 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, when you go through all the above benefits, I am sure you can see that the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan is an important financial tool for parents/students who are supposed to enter the university soon. 

It helps ensure that the financial aspect of tertiary education is well-managed, reduces stress, and allows parents to provide the best opportunities for their children without resorting to debt or financial hardship. Isn't this something you and your family also wish to have?
