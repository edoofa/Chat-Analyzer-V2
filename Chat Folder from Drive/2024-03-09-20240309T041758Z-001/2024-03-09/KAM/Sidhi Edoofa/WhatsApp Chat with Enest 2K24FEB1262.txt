This group will keep a record of the tasks and projects you undertake. You will be provided with the link to the group after the completion of the admission process session and on the dedicated date for your EWYL session, where you will be able to directly speak to your EWYL mentor. I hope you are clear about the purpose of the two groups.

2/3/24, 3:05 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to know that you are clear about the purpose of the two WhatsApp groups and it's reassuring to hear this from your end. I also had a recent conversation with your counsellor, during which he provided me with some insights into your academic background and career aspirations. I must commend you as a family, you must take great pride in your achievements and be dedicated to ensuring your access to the finest opportunities to launch your career.
2/3/24, 3:06 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Speaking of valuable opportunities, I am also curious to learn more about your counselling session with your counsellor and to understand which aspects of the Edoofa Scholarship Program have particularly impressed you thus far. Can you share this with me?
2/3/24, 3:12 PM - +263 71 138 0675: The aspects of the Edoofa Scholarship Program which impressed us is that it is affordable as it reduce the cost from 6000 usd or 8000 usd to 2000 usd or 3000 usd
2/3/24, 3:14 PM - +263 71 149 8828: And also that a student has the opportunity to reduce the cost of education.

2/3/24, 3:21 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I have known Ms. Harmehak for a long time and she always ensures that each and every student of her gets personalised attention so that she can ensure their academic career is on track. I am glad to know that you find the program to be so helpful in financial terms and for the EWYL program.
2/3/24, 3:21 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Moving forward with the procedures, I would like to share an insight with you.

4. *Include Authority Details*: Ensure that the letter contains the details of the signing authority, including their full name, contact number, and email ID.
4/3/24, 10:47 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: This letter of recommendation is a crucial document that will support your application process. The Edoofa Academic Board will use those details to reach out to your school authorities and verify the recommendation letter before adding it to your scholarship application and hence I would like to inquire by when will you be able to share the same document with us?
4/3/24, 10:52 AM - +263 71 149 8828: Taken note of Ma'am.
4/3/24, 10:53 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that and I am looking forward to getting an update from your end. I would also like to reiterate that our operational hours are from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM, Central African Time.

I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them.

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
4/3/24, 11:16 AM - +263 71 138 0675: <Media omitted>
4/3/24, 11:16 AM - +263 71 138 0675: <Media omitted>

4/3/24, 11:19 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
4/3/24, 11:21 AM - +263 71 138 0675: Done
4/3/24, 11:25 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
4/3/24, 11:26 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
4/3/24, 11:30 AM - +263 71 138 0675: Yes they are clear thank you
4/3/24, 11:31 AM - +263 71 149 8828: They all clear thanks
4/3/24, 11:36 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counselling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counselling session will take about 1 hour.
4/3/24, 11:36 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
4/3/24, 11:38 AM - +263 71 149 8828: Yes following
4/3/24, 11:39 AM - +263 71 138 0675: Yes we are following
4/3/24, 11:41 AM - +27 67 980 7842: There is a recommendation letter  from his school that he already has maybe he can send it and Ms Siddh can say if its upto standard or not
4/3/24, 11:42 AM - +263 71 149 8828: Yes we hve done that  thank u
4/3/24, 11:44 AM - +27 67 980 7842: Lets say 13.00
4/3/24, 11:46 AM - +263 71 149 8828: She had network  challenges. We are sorry about that. We had said 1100hrs
4/3/24, 11:51 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Surely, kindly share the recommendation letter with me.
4/3/24, 11:52 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. I have taken a note of it and will schedule our future sessions at 1:00 PM.
4/3/24, 11:52 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process, the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
4/3/24, 11:52 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
4/3/24, 11:53 AM - +263 71 149 8828: Here
4/3/24, 11:54 AM - +263 71 149 8828: Thank you. Noted

5/3/24, 2:37 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that you are doing well. I am doing fine, thank you for asking. I understand please, thank you for letting me know that. During our previous session, I had shared 4 videos containing messages from the founder's office. May I know if you were able to go through all of them and understand the intended message?
5/3/24, 2:38 PM - +263 71 138 0675: Yes we did thank you
5/3/24, 2:43 PM - +263 71 149 8828: Yes l did thank you
5/3/24, 2:48 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. To discuss the videos and the importance of the message shared by the founders, could you kindly share your understanding of each video with me?
5/3/24, 2:50 PM - +263 71 138 0675: On the first video the founders explained that the students should be teachable and open-minded.They also explained that edoofa student should follow instructions.
5/3/24, 2:50 PM - +263 71 138 0675: The second video the founders explained that Edoofa increase student's capacity for success thus making, students more responsible and independent.
5/3/24, 2:50 PM - +263 71 138 0675: On the third video the founders were explaining that Edoofa invested a lot of time which is over 10 years to identify good schools, colleges and universities for passionate Edoofians.The founders also encourage students to follow instructions to prepare and be qualified for the institutions.
5/3/24, 2:51 PM - +263 71 138 0675: On the forth video, the founders explained that the statement of purpose is important and students should be prompt in taking action, and be diligent in filling out the form.
5/3/24, 2:52 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. Let me share my views as well so that it will help you expand your understanding.

*Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students:* In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. 

You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent.
5/3/24, 2:52 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s vision for you:* Here our founders talk about the most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of tomorrow.
5/3/24, 2:52 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program:* Talking about the third video, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
5/3/24, 2:52 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP:* Another thing is that Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based. 

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
5/3/24, 2:52 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
5/3/24, 2:53 PM - +263 71 149 8828: First video

Edoofa program main objective is to offer a life transforming education through the selected institutions

5/3/24, 2:54 PM - +263 71 138 0675: Yes we are

5/3/24, 3:01 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
5/3/24, 3:01 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Here are some key points to consider when requesting the letter from your school:

1. *Visit Your School*: Approach your school administration or the designated authority for issuing such letters.

2. *Provide Necessary Information*: Ensure that the drafted letter includes essential details such as your identity as a student of the school, *your subject combination for A Level exams*, and your intention to sit for the exams this academic year.

4. *Include Authority Details*: Ensure that the letter contains the details of the signing authority, including their full name, contact number, and email ID.
5/3/24, 3:01 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This letter of recommendation is a crucial document that will support your application process. The Edoofa Academic Board will use those details to reach out to your school authorities and verify the recommendation letter before adding it to your scholarship application and hence I would like to inquire by when will you be able to share the letter of recommendation with us?
5/3/24, 3:08 PM - +263 71 138 0675: <Media omitted>
5/3/24, 3:15 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the letter of recommendation with me. I have duly taken a note of it and added it to your application profile.

5/3/24, 3:24 PM - +263 71 138 0675: Okay thank you and have a blessed day.
6/3/24, 12:00 PM - +263 71 138 0675: <Media omitted>
6/3/24, 12:00 PM - +263 71 138 0675: Good morning everyone
6/3/24, 12:00 PM - +263 71 138 0675: Question 1
6/3/24, 12:02 PM - +263 71 138 0675: Question 2. 
* Human Rights definition
*  - these are rights that every human being is entitled to. These rights are not based on ethnicity , nationality or religion , examples are right to shelter , freedom of expression , right of association and right to life.

*Civil rights definition
- These are rights given to citizens basing on their citizenship in a particular state. A state protecs it's people by providing legal frameworks , through the judiciary system or laws of that country , examples right to fair trial in court , right of having freedom from discrimination on religion or color or race.

- *Duties definition
These are tasks or actions that someone is required to perform.

* Difference between Rights and Duties
Rights and Duties are interrelated in every social and political activity of man. While rights exalt individual liberty , duties express the dignity of that liberty. Duties of a juridical nature presuppose others of a moral nature which support them in principle and constitute their basis.


* Difference between Human Rights and civil rights

Human Rights are different from civil rights because , human Rights are entitled to every human being by virtue of being human. While civil rights are particular rights per state that are granted to the citizens of that country by the government. Meanwhile both rights are important in citizens so that there is fairness and freedom of everyone.
6/3/24, 12:03 PM - +263 71 138 0675: Question 3

Prosecutor definition

_ A person employed by government to work as a lawyer in the states courts, his or her duties, involve representing the state in criminal cases whereby offenders are charged for crimes committed against government or public.

Attorney definition
_ A person who provides legal services to clients. An Attorney is a licensed legal professional who also drafts legal documents, provide legal advice and can work against a co - oporate lawyer.


The difference between a prosecutor and an Attorney is that a prosecutor represents the state in criminal cases while an Attorney is any legally registered professional who provides legal advice to clients in different legal issues, prosecutors seek justice on criminal cases where as Attorneys focus on providing legal advice.
6/3/24, 12:03 PM - +263 71 138 0675: Question 4

Criminal law

I am interested in Criminal law. This is because, criminal law refers to the body of law that deals with crimes and their range of topics, including definitions of crimes, penalties for those crimes ,and procedures for enforcing those penalties. The reason why I want criminal law is because I have seen people who break the government laws , doing different types of crimes,and this breaks my heart to see people who break laws, Soo this is why I am interested in criminal law, as it will help to reduce crimes in a country which I believe is a good thing.
6/3/24, 12:03 PM - +263 71 138 0675: Question 5


The skills that I believe will make me a successful lawyer are: 
1Communication skills 

I can effectively communicate and write clearly while representing clients, with this skill I will ba able to negotiate on behalf of my clients with opposing parties, for a fair and just conclusion of cases. As a lawyer I must be able to understand the case at hand and articulate issues so that my defense will be good. An example is that I was once a class monitor at high school and I was communicating with ever y student in the class.


2. Analytical skills

_in pursuing cases I will need to be able to sift what is necessary from volumes of information brought by the client. I believe I do have the analysing skill which will allow me to get facts and align my defense accordingly. An example is that I was good in history when I was in high school because , I was good in analysing questions.


3. Research skills.

I believe I poses this skill as I I once carried out a research based on why my community Well was producing contaminated water. I did this with other school leavers and found out that there was an overflow of efficient from a nearby farm. Possessing this skill will assist me in researching for relevant , current and legal precedents which go case by case.


4. Interpersonal skills.

I believe I have this skill as , I am able to mingle with different backgrounds. As a lawyer I will use this skill to relate build relationships with other legal professionals in pursuing my career.

7/3/24, 12:23 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Enest,

I hope you are all doing good. Thank you for sharing the message and the screenshot, it has been duly noted. Before we proceed with our discussion today, I would like to ask how things are on your end today?
7/3/24, 12:30 PM - +263 71 138 0675: Good Afternoon Ms Singh, everything is good this side how are you doing?
7/3/24, 12:34 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Everything is well here, thank you for asking. With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey. we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counselling on university admission*.
7/3/24, 12:34 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: However, before we do the same, I was going through your scholarship application file and noticed that you are supposed to make the payment of your remaining part of Edoofa Enrollment fee before 20 March 2024. Hence, I thought of sharing a gentle reminder with you and trying to understand how your preparation has been so far? Have you been able to align your preparations in the right direction?
7/3/24, 2:26 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: @263711380675 may I know if we are still connected?
7/3/24, 2:41 PM - +263 71 138 0675: We are aware of that Ms Singh we are still trying to organize it before the deadline
7/3/24, 2:42 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. We will reconnect with each other a few days before your due date to take a follow up on this and understand your preparations better.

In the meantime, let us move forward with our discussion. To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is BA LLB and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
7/3/24, 2:44 PM - +263 71 138 0675: Yes it is accurate
7/3/24, 2:45 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
7/3/24, 2:45 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
7/3/24, 2:45 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
7/3/24, 2:45 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
7/3/24, 2:47 PM - +263 71 138 0675: Yes
7/3/24, 2:51 PM - +263 71 138 0675: Okay well understood thank you
7/3/24, 2:52 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
7/3/24, 2:52 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $1000. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalise their registration process.
7/3/24, 2:52 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counsellor has also discussed the registration fee during your counselling sessions, correct?
7/3/24, 3:15 PM - +263 71 138 0675: Yes correct
7/3/24, 3:20 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $1200 to $1800 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
7/3/24, 3:22 PM - +263 71 138 0675: Yes we are
7/3/24, 3:23 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:
7/3/24, 3:23 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 1. *Tuition Fee*: $650 per annum
2. *Accommodation Fee*: $0 per annum (100% Sponsorship)
3. *Remaining Fee Components*: [Library Fee, Examination Fee, EDB and Book Bank, International Student Development Fund, 24-Hour WiFi Cost, Maintenance Fee, Water Bill, and Electricity Bill]: $1000 per annum

*Total Fee: Tuition Fee $650 + Accommodation Fee $0 + Remaining Fee Components $1000 = $1650 per annum.* <This message was edited>
7/3/24, 3:23 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Registration Fee to be paid: $1000 (deadline within two weeks of issue of the offer letter, part of the university’s first-year fee and will be adjusted against the first-year cost of education $1650). I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?
7/3/24, 3:25 PM - +263 71 138 0675: Yes I did thank you
7/3/24, 3:27 PM - +27 67 980 7842: Fully taken note of ma'am
7/3/24, 3:28 PM - +27 67 980 7842: We are on the same page
7/3/24, 3:32 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $1000, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $1000 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $1650 as per the above example.
7/3/24, 3:32 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $1650 - $1000 = $650. This amount can be paid in two instalments of $325 each. The initial instalment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $325 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly instalments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
7/3/24, 4:19 PM - +27 67 980 7842: Don't we pay registration fee after receiving an offer letter?
7/3/24, 4:20 PM - +27 67 980 7842: Referring to this message we have to receive various offer letters then choose which one we prefer considering the factors you have mentioned
7/3/24, 4:40 PM - +263 71 149 8828: Ook understood
7/3/24, 4:56 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Once you receive your first offer letter, it's required that you proceed with the payment of the registration fees for that university in order to secure your seat. It's crucial to note that once the deadline for payment has passed, your seat can no longer be guaranteed. Therefore, timely payment of the registration fees is essential to secure your place at the university.

Upon receiving more offer letters, you will have the option to choose from one of them, and the registration amount initially paid by you will finally be recorded against the university of your choice. I hope this helps?
7/3/24, 5:14 PM - +27 67 980 7842: Ohh ok ....Fully understood
7/3/24, 5:19 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Since my operational hours for the day have already concluded, let us reconnect tomorrow at 1:00 PM to continue with our discussion.

I wish you and your family a blessed evening ahead!
7/3/24, 5:27 PM - +27 67 980 7842: Thank you ..enjoy your evening too
7/3/24, 5:30 PM - +263 71 138 0675: Thank you and have a nice evening
7/3/24, 5:38 PM - +263 71 149 8828: Clear now thanks very much
7/3/24, 7:06 PM - +263 71 149 8828: Thank you enjoy your evening too
8/3/24, 1:10 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Enest,

I hope you are having a lovely day. I would like to begin by wishing a Happy International Women's Day to all the incredible women in your family and around the world! May you continue to inspire, empower, and thrive in all aspects of life.

Before we proceed with our discussion, I would like to check in on you and your family. How is everything on your end today?
8/3/24, 1:15 PM - +263 71 149 8828: Thank you very much. We are doing well and thanking God we as women in this group have seen this day.
8/3/24, 1:24 PM - +263 71 138 0675: Everything is good and how's everyone your side.
8/3/24, 1:34 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Everything and everyone over here is well, thank you for asking. Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
8/3/24, 1:55 PM - +263 71 149 8828: Yes we surely understand thank u
8/3/24, 2:06 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
8/3/24, 2:06 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
8/3/24, 2:06 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
8/3/24, 2:18 PM - +263 71 149 8828: Ma'am l guess Enest has connectivity challenges . But as the guardian responsible l do understand everything being said  in pursuant of his educational journey.  I will share details once he and his sister get connected. I am very sorry about that
8/3/24, 2:20 PM - +263 71 138 0675: Well understood thank you
8/3/24, 2:23 PM - +263 71 138 0675: Okay we understand thank you very much
8/3/24, 2:24 PM - +263 71 138 0675: Sorry for the late reply I had a network challenge.
8/3/24, 2:29 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. It is completely alright.
8/3/24, 2:29 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.
8/3/24, 2:39 PM - +263 71 138 0675: Okay thank you Ms Singh
8/3/24, 2:54 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: You are welcome. Alright please, Now with this, we are done with step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
8/3/24, 2:54 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one.
8/3/24, 2:54 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
8/3/24, 2:54 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
8/3/24, 3:15 PM - +263 71 138 0675: Yes we are excited thank you
8/3/24, 3:16 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to know that. The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
8/3/24, 3:16 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavour for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received special news for the students of the 2024 admission intake. May I know if you are excited to know the news we have for you?
8/3/24, 3:16 PM - +263 71 149 8828: We as family are very excited about evry step
8/3/24, 3:17 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am happy to see that you are excited. After speaking with thousands of students and parents who completed their admission process before you, we realised that the current economic situation in African countries makes it a bit challenging for parents to pay the full registration fee at once.
8/3/24, 3:17 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: In response to the same challenge, we had a detailed discussion with the academic board and university official. As a result, we developed a solution to alleviate the financial burden of the parents specifically for the registration fee due of $500 to $1000. 

We at Edoofa are thrilled about this development, and I believe it will significantly help all of our students and their families. Are you aware of the solution?
8/3/24, 3:19 PM - +263 71 138 0675: Yes we are very excited
8/3/24, 3:20 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Let me share more about the same. With respect to the conversation we had with the academic board and the university officials, we requested them to allow the students to make the payment of their registration fee in two parts within a span of 45 days thereby reducing the financial pressure.

Here's how it works: Consider that your registration fee is $1000. After you will receive the offer letter, the first part of the registration fees which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, i.e. $500 needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university (For most of the universities 15 days). Subsequently, the second part of $500, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
8/3/24, 3:20 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for March 29, 2024, and your registration fee stands at $1000, you'll need to make a payment of $500 on or before March 29, 2024. The remaining $500 should be paid by April 29 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
8/3/24, 3:22 PM - +263 71 138 0675: Well understood Ms Singh
8/3/24, 3:23 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Before proceeding further, I would like to inquire if you have any questions regarding the admission process and the associated costs for your admission and higher education?
8/3/24, 3:34 PM - +263 71 149 8828: This is good news to us
8/3/24, 3:52 PM - +263 71 138 0675: You explained everything Ms Singh everything is clear thank you
8/3/24, 3:53 PM - +263 71 149 8828: And thus gives us more time to mobilise our resources
8/3/24, 3:58 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that, parents and Enest. With this, we can proceed to step 4 of the admission cycle, i.e., *Offer Letter from University/College*. Are you excited to initiate the process? For the current round of admissions, only 31 scholarship seats are available and hence let us begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the payment plan offered for the registration fee. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
8/3/24, 3:59 PM - +263 71 149 8828: Yes we are
8/3/24, 4:03 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. With this, we can proceed to step 4 of the admission cycle, i.e., Offer Letter from University/College. The universities will take three to five days to evaluate your application, after which, if they accept your application for a scholarship, they will send you a scholarship offer letter. In the offer letter, the scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee will be mentioned.
8/3/24, 4:03 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: On this note, let us conclude our conversation for today. I had a very good time interacting with you, Mr and Mrs Ndebele, and Enest. I will reach out to you once we get an update from the universities. Wish you a blessed day ahead, and please extend our regards to your family as well.
8/3/24, 4:03 PM - +263 71 138 0675: Yes we are
8/3/24, 4:07 PM - +263 71 138 0675: We will do soo and have a good day
8/3/24, 4:09 PM - +263 71 149 8828: Thank you very much for the lovely conversation.
