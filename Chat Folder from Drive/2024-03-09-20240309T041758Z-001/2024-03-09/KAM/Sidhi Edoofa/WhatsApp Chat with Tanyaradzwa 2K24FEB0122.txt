26/2/24, 10:33 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Tanyaradzwa,

I hope you had a wonderful weekend. Over the weekend, our team engaged in discussions regarding the Meet and Greet Seminar, reflecting on the valuable insights gained from interacting with our students. The experience was truly enriching for us, and we hope it was equally enjoyable for you as well.

Before we proceed with our discussion today, I would like to inquire how you are doing this fine morning?
26/2/24, 10:43 AM - +27 74 285 7749: We are doing fine
26/2/24, 10:44 AM - +263 78 583 1530: We are doing fine and you
26/2/24, 10:44 AM - +27 82 605 7855: Good morning to you too,
All good thanks
26/2/24, 10:51 AM - +27 82 605 7855: I think Tanyaradzwa is busy with her class work for now.
26/2/24, 11:03 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. I am doing well, thank you for asking. I understand that she is currently busy with class right now. In such a case, if you are available, we can proceed with our discussion for today. <This message was edited>
26/2/24, 11:04 AM - +27 74 285 7749: Okay we can proceed
26/2/24, 11:04 AM - +27 82 605 7855: Yes
26/2/24, 11:07 AM - +263 78 583 1530: We can proceed
26/2/24, 11:14 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. Moving forward in today's session, we will discuss a bit about your university admission journey. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts. I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them.

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
26/2/24, 11:15 AM - +263 78 583 1530: Okay
26/2/24, 11:16 AM - +27 74 285 7749: We can proceed
26/2/24, 11:22 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
26/2/24, 11:27 AM - +263 78 583 1530: Done
26/2/24, 11:32 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
26/2/24, 11:33 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
26/2/24, 12:19 PM - +263 78 583 1530: Yes
26/2/24, 12:21 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps -

*Step 3: Introduction to the Financial Secure Plan* - Parents with children embarking on their university journey within the next one to two years face important decision-making and rigorous financial planning. Edoofa recognizes the significance of this transition and hence has introduced the Edoofa Secure Plan - a unique and systematic strategy to empower parents in financial planning and preparing for their child's tertiary education well in advance.
26/2/24, 12:21 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Scholarship Offer Letter from the university would be issued next year in the month of August.

I hope you are following?
26/2/24, 12:28 PM - +263 78 583 1530: Yes
26/2/24, 12:45 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. The registration fee will be paid through the savings you have accumulated visa the Financial Secure Plan. After the registration fee is paid, for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
26/2/24, 12:45 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
26/2/24, 12:46 PM - +263 78 583 1530: Yes
26/2/24, 12:57 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through all 6 steps, if we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
26/2/24, 1:01 PM - +263 78 583 1530: I am ready <This message was edited>
26/2/24, 1:05 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
26/2/24, 1:05 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding. Until you are ready, shall we start with our discussion with me individually? 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
26/2/24, 1:07 PM - +263 78 583 1530: Yes

26/2/24, 1:12 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Could you kindly let me know of a timing when you will be available to discuss the videos tomorrow?
26/2/24, 1:12 PM - +263 78 583 1530: Around 11
26/2/24, 1:14 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is wonderful to hear. In that case, we will be concluding the conversation for now and we will reconnect tomorrow at 11:00 AM for our next session. 

I hope by then you will be able to go through the videos. If you have any queries or concerns before then, feel free to share them here in your admission group. Wish you a blessed day ahead and please ensure to extend our regards to your family as well.
26/2/24, 1:46 PM - +263 78 583 1530: Ok
27/2/24, 11:50 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Tanyaradzwa,

I hope you are doing well today. Kindly excuse me for the delay in reaching out to you today, as I was not feeling well since morning. However, I am doing better now and eager to proceed with our session. Before we do so, may I know how your day has been going so far?
27/2/24, 11:52 AM - +263 78 583 1530: It's a little bit busy but fine
27/2/24, 11:53 AM - +27 74 285 7749: Thanks. we are doing fine .
27/2/24, 11:54 AM - +27 82 605 7855: We are all good thanks ,sorry to hear that you are not feeling well .
27/2/24, 11:59 AM - +263 78 583 1530: Hope you will have a quick recovery
27/2/24, 12:05 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for your concern, I appreciate it. I am feeling better indeed. Regarding our discussion yesterday, may I know if you were able to go through the videos that I had shared with you?
27/2/24, 12:22 PM - +263 78 583 1530: I went through video 4 and 2
27/2/24, 12:26 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that. May I know if you will be able to go through video 1 and 3 at the moment?
27/2/24, 12:32 PM - +263 78 583 1530: Okay I will after 10 mins
27/2/24, 12:53 PM - +263 78 583 1530: I'm done
27/2/24, 1:01 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that. To discuss the videos and the importance of the message shared by the founders, could you kindly share your understanding of each video with me?
27/2/24, 2:36 PM - +263 78 583 1530: I understood that we must feel welcomed at any university or college . The videos gave the idea of how I'm really aware of the course I might undertake at university
27/2/24, 2:38 PM - +263 78 583 1530: I heard that the universities are affordable. I must not let the abilities that I have when signing forms or during sessions
27/2/24, 2:39 PM - +263 78 583 1530: Lastly important thing I understand is to follow instructions always
27/2/24, 2:50 PM - +263 78 583 1530: And I should use my experience  and reasons why I chose the program
27/2/24, 3:22 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. Let me share my views as well so that it will help you expand your understanding.

*Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students:* In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. 

You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent.
27/2/24, 3:22 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s vision for you:* Here our founders talk about the most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of tomorrow.
27/2/24, 3:22 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program:* Talking about the third video, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
27/2/24, 3:22 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP:* Another thing is that Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based. 

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
27/2/24, 3:23 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose. I hope you were able to follow through with this?
28/2/24, 8:29 AM - +263 78 583 1530: Good morning
Yes
28/2/24, 11:30 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Tanyaradzwa,

I hope you are having a lovely morning today. Before we proceed with our discussion, I would like to ask how is everything on your end today?
28/2/24, 11:43 AM - +27 74 285 7749: We are all doing fine.how are you feeling today
28/2/24, 12:28 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. I am doing much better today, thank you for asking. Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by tomorrow before our session.
28/2/24, 12:28 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

https://goo.gl/forms/iWss6zPuOFbnGTXK2
28/2/24, 12:28 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 2. I am sharing two documents with you. Kindly go through both documents and submit your responses to the course document here in the group. Make sure you research well before starting the task. All the best!
28/2/24, 12:29 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
28/2/24, 12:29 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
28/2/24, 12:29 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Along with these tasks, I want you to share the following documents with us as they are required for your university application preparation:

*1. A-Level Result or Letter of Recommendation or Statement of Entry (A-Level).*

*2. O-Level Results*

*3. Identity proof (International Traveling Passport or National ID or Birth Certificate)*
29/2/24, 7:57 AM - +263 78 583 1530: Entrepreneurship and economic development are also related, but they have different goals. Entrepreneurship is focused on starting and growing new businesses. Economic development is focused on creating jobs and improving the economic conditions of a community or region. Entrepreneurs are often focused on their own businesses, while economic development professionals are focused on the broader economic well-being of a region. They often work with governments and other organizations to create programs that promote economic growth. 



GAAP stands for Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. It's a set of rules and standards that accountants use to record and report financial information. GAAP is important because it ensures that financial information is presented in a consistent and understandable way. This helps investors, creditors, and other stakeholders make informed decisions about a company's financial health. It also helps to ensure that financial information is accurate and reliable.


Accounting standards are rules and guidelines that govern how financial information is recorded and reported. These standards are established by organizations like the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) and the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). These standards are mandatory because they help to ensure consistency and transparency in financial reporting. This is important because it allows investors and other stakeholders to compare companies' financial information on a level playing field. Without these standards, it would be very difficult to make fair comparisons between companies. 


Accounting and auditing are two different but related processes. Accounting is the process of recording and reporting financial information. Auditing is the process of verifying the accuracy and completeness of that information. Accountants record and report financial information, while auditors review and analyze that information to make sure it's correct. You could think of accounting as the process of creating a report, and auditing as the process of checking the report for errors.

29/2/24, 10:02 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Tanyaradzwa,

I hope you are doing well today. Thank you for sharing the answers, your passport and O-Level results with me. I have duly taken a note of the same. Could you kindly confirm whether you were also able to complete the 1st question and the online google form?
29/2/24, 10:05 AM - +27 82 605 7855: Good morning ,yes we all fine thanks.
29/2/24, 10:10 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am so pleased to hear that. Could you kindly let me know if you were also able to go through my previous message?
29/2/24, 10:11 AM - +27 82 605 7855: I think Tanyaradzwa is busy right now ,she will respond when she is free, thanks
29/2/24, 10:14 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. In such a case, we can proceed with our discussion and she can respond when she is free. Also, as promised, now that you are a part of the Edoofa Journey, the opportunity to help you self-fund your higher education and for you to be industry-ready s here, and in light of the same, I would like to assist you in getting started with your EWYL Journey.
29/2/24, 10:14 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: With your intention and commencement date in mind, we have already communicated this information to the EWYL team. They are prepared to initiate your EWYL program on Friday.

To kick start the process, your dedicated EWYL Mentor has established your EWYL Group and shared the invitation link with us. Here's what you and your parents/guardian/sponsor need to do:
29/2/24, 10:14 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: https://chat.whatsapp.com/FLO5hIy5NiC7O85DhLjMoQ

Tanyaradzwa EWYL23E1289
29/2/24, 10:15 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Use the above-provided link to join your group. Once both you and your parents have joined, please send the following message to the group:

*Dear Mentor, my name is Musundire Tanyaradzwa, and my EWYL group name is Tanyaradzwa EWYL23E1289. I am excited to begin my EWYL Journey. As discussed with the admission team, I am committed to being available on 1 March 2024 to commence the procedures. Kindly schedule my session for the same date so that I can maximize the benefits and start on the right track.*
29/2/24, 10:16 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Once you start with the EWYL Program and are able to connect with your mentor, please update the same here as well by sending the below message:

*Hello Admission officer, I am now in touch with my EWYL Mentor. The name of my Mentor is* _________ *and he/she has scheduled my session for* ________ (mention the date)
29/2/24, 10:18 AM - +27 74 285 7749: <Media omitted>
29/2/24, 10:20 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the screenshot with me, Tanyaradzwa. Were you also able to go through the details I shared with you regarding your EWYL group?
29/2/24, 12:49 PM - +263 78 583 1530: Yes
29/2/24, 12:51 PM - +263 78 583 1530: Noted
29/2/24, 12:51 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for confirming that. With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey, i.e. *Introduction to Financial Secure Plan*.
29/2/24, 12:51 PM - +263 78 583 1530: Thank you
29/2/24, 12:51 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: However, before we start the same, I was going through your scholarship application file and noticed that you are supposed to make the payment of your remaining part of Edoofa Enrollment fee. Hence, I thought of sharing a gentle reminder with you and trying to understand how your preparation has been so far? Have you been able to align your preparations in the right direction?
29/2/24, 5:17 PM - +27 82 605 7855: Yes ,we will pay up the balance left and forward the receipt thanks .Please can you create a reference order with the Mama Money App and send it to us then we can deposit it.Thanks
1/3/24, 10:09 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Tanyaradzwa,

I hope you are doing well. Surely, allow me some time for the same. In the meantime, Let us move forward with our discussion. To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is BCom and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2025. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
1/3/24, 10:14 AM - +27 82 605 7855: Good morning,we are all good thanks
1/3/24, 10:15 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Could you kindly confirm whether the information I have shared above is accurate?
1/3/24, 10:17 AM - +27 82 605 7855: Yes
1/3/24, 10:17 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. Based on our experience of over 14 years and having assisted over 5000 students from different countries, we have realized that financial planning is the most important factor when a student plans for their higher education abroad.
1/3/24, 10:17 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am sure that you must be aware that 20-30% of students who are admitted into universities abroad are unable to fulfill their dream and come to India due to a lack of financial planning. The funds needed for booking flights, accommodation, and covering living expenses after arrival often become overwhelming, leading to the decision to defer their admission for a year. This, in turn, creates a gap in the child's education.
1/3/24, 10:17 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: To assist both students and parents in this regard, Edoofa Management has designed a Financial Secure Plan that aims to help you prepare for your higher educational finances without experiencing stress or last-minute rushes. I believe you must be wondering about the details of the same plan and how it helps the parents?
1/3/24, 10:18 AM - +27 82 605 7855: Very true
1/3/24, 10:20 AM - +27 82 605 7855: Yes please will you explain how it helps the parents
1/3/24, 10:20 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Edoofa Secure Plan is important for parents who have children joining the university for tertiary education in the next one to two years for several reasons:
1/3/24, 10:20 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: /esfp2
1/3/24, 10:21 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: 1. *Financial Preparedness:* The Edoofa Secure plan helps parents prepare financially for the costs after the Scholarship being offered so that they are not caught off guard.

2. *Reduced Financial Stress:* Having the Edoofa Secure Plan in place can significantly reduce the financial stress on you as parents when your child is about to enter university. Knowing that there is a dedicated fund for education expenses provides peace of mind.
1/3/24, 10:21 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: 3. *Avoiding Debt*: Without proper savings, some parents may resort to taking out loans or accumulating credit card debt to cover their child's education costs. This Educational savings plan helps avoid the burden of debt and high-interest payments.

4. *Compound Interest:* By starting to save early and consistently contributing to the savings plan, parents can take advantage of compound interest, which can significantly increase the amount available for education expenses.
1/3/24, 10:21 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: 5. *Flexibility and Control:* The Edoofa Secure savings plans allow parents to have greater control over their finances and how they allocate funds for their child's education. They can choose investment options that align with their risk tolerance and financial goals.

6. *Encouraging Responsibility*: Involving your child in the process of saving for their education teaches them financial responsibility and the value of higher education. It also motivates them to outperform in Academics.
1/3/24, 10:21 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: 7. *Adapting to Unexpected Changes*: Life is full of surprises, and circumstances can change especially when there are political reforms changing each day impacting the Local Currency. Having an Edoofa Secure Plan allows parents to adapt to unexpected changes in their financial situation while still prioritizing their child's education.

8. *Peace of Mind:* Overall, having the Edoofa Secure plan provides parents with peace of mind, knowing that they are actively planning for their child's future and increasing the likelihood of providing them with a solid education.
1/3/24, 10:21 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, when you go through all the above benefits, I am sure you can see that the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan is an important financial tool for parents/students who are supposed to enter the university soon. 

It helps ensure that the financial aspect of tertiary education is well-managed, reduces stress, and allows parents to provide the best opportunities for their children without resorting to debt or financial hardship. Isn't this something you and your family also wish to have?
1/3/24, 10:26 AM - +27 82 605 7855: Yes that's really fantastic, thank you so much for all the information .We wish for the best in our family and thanks again.
1/3/24, 10:27 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through the above points, do you want me to help you understand how the Edoofa Secure Plan works?
1/3/24, 10:27 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through the above points, do you want me to help you understand how the Edoofa Secure Plan works?
1/3/24, 10:29 AM - +27 82 605 7855: Yes
1/3/24, 10:30 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, as you are aware, we are currently in March 2024, and we have a good 20 months to plan for your finances before you start your university education in 2025.
1/3/24, 10:30 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: During the counseling session, you were informed that at Edoofa, we guarantee a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship on the tuition fees. Hence, the cost of education, including food and accommodation after the scholarship, would be between $2000-$3000, and it could be even less. Not more than that.
1/3/24, 10:30 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: This means that if you can save $150 per month for the next 20 months, you will be able to save $3000. This amount is more than enough for the first year of university fees, including tuition fees (if any), food, and accommodation. I hope you agree with this?
1/3/24, 10:32 AM - +27 82 605 7855: Noted
1/3/24, 10:44 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Right, this means that by the time you would be in India, you would have already saved the $3000 that will cover the first-year fee.
1/3/24, 10:45 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, in these next 20 months, I am sure you would also be engaged in the EWYL program, and if you secure a minimum of $1000 in 20 months, that means the fees for 1.5 years are already secured.
1/3/24, 10:45 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, for a 3-year course, if we follow the same approach for the remaining 1.5 years, the educational journey for the student and the financial journey for the parent will be easy and smooth. I believe you must be able to see this perspective?
1/3/24, 10:51 AM - +27 82 605 7855: Noted
1/3/24, 10:57 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. With that said, there is also another benefit, I am sure being in Zimbabwe you know how drastically the exchange rate fluctuates.
1/3/24, 10:57 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: If you are buying a dollar today, you might be spending 7000 bonds, but if you buy a dollar after a month, the rate would be different.
1/3/24, 10:57 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Also, even if you choose to buy dollars every month and save at your home, it is not safe since there is news of robbery, and mugging every day.
1/3/24, 10:57 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: In that case, you will opt to save in the Bank, but again we know that savings in the Bank require a Nostro Account which means you have to pay the bank to keep your money safe, right?
1/3/24, 11:00 AM - +27 82 605 7855: Yes
1/3/24, 11:02 AM - +27 82 605 7855: Very true
1/3/24, 11:28 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is great to hear. Considering these constraints, Edoofa Management has decided to help the parents and students prepare for the journey way ahead of time by helping them save money with Edoofa without any additional charges but rather saving additional money as well. Do you want me to explain how this has been achieved?
1/3/24, 11:42 AM - +27 82 605 7855: This message was deleted
1/3/24, 11:43 AM - +27 82 605 7855: Yes please
1/3/24, 12:36 PM - +263 78 583 1530: Yes
1/3/24, 2:14 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for the delay in my response, please. I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Program Fee (Enrollment Fee) that you were asked to pay is $350. From the $350, you have already paid $200, and the remaining $150 is what you are planning to pay before your due date.
1/3/24, 2:14 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Under the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan, a parent has to deposit a small amount of money which is $150 every month for the next 10 months. 

That means, in 10 months, the money saved will be $1500. When this money is saved, Edoofa will waive off the remaining $150 which was due from the Edoofa Program/Enrollment Fee of $350, thereby making a straight saving of $150 in 10 months.
1/3/24, 2:14 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Imagine you paying $15 every month to the Bank of Zimbabwe to keep your money safe, and here Edoofa is paying you $15 every month to keep your money safe. Now, you must be wondering, why only for 10 months and not for 20 months, right?
1/3/24, 2:37 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
1/3/24, 2:40 PM - +27 82 605 7855: Thanks
1/3/24, 2:47 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: You are most welcome. May I know if you were also able to go through my previous messages?
1/3/24, 5:00 PM - +27 82 605 7855: Yes
1/3/24, 6:02 PM - +263 78 583 1530: This message was deleted

2/3/24, 12:16 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Tanyaradzwa,

I hope you are all doing wonderful this Saturday afternoon. Thank you for sharing the receipt of the Mama Money payment with me. I have duly taken a note of it and will update your application profile accordingly.
2/3/24, 12:19 PM - +27 74 285 7749: Okay thank you  and enjoy your weekend
2/3/24, 12:21 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: May I know if you are currently available for further discussion?
2/3/24, 12:37 PM - +27 82 605 7855: Yes we are available
2/3/24, 12:41 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that. In our previous session, we were discussing how the Edoofa Management has come up with a solution to help the parents and students with various constraints. May I know if you were able to follow through with the details?
2/3/24, 12:42 PM - +27 82 605 7855: Yes
2/3/24, 12:44 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that. If you see the bigger picture, you will realize that the reason is quite simple. Upon the completion of the 10 installments, the Edoofa Admissions team will initiate the Child’s Admission Process by applying early to the universities to secure their scholarship and their university seat.
2/3/24, 12:44 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Reserving seats earlier increases the chances of obtaining a maximum scholarship. A higher scholarship means lower fees, and by securing the seat, you will be entitled to pay the fees as per the old fee structure of the university, not the new one implemented in January 2025. Furthermore, when applying to the universities, you will receive an offer letter or a letter of intent detailing the fees, scholarship, and registration fees.
2/3/24, 12:45 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: As explained during the enrollment process, the registration fee is a portion of your first-year university fee, paid to reserve the seat. It ranges from $500-$1000 and is not an additional fee. 

From the $1500 you saved with Edoofa, the registration fee will be paid to the university, securing the seat. For instance, if the registration fee is $1000, Edoofa will pay $1000 from the $1500 saved in 10 months. The updated balance with Edoofa will be $500, which will be paid to the university upon your arrival in India.
2/3/24, 12:45 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This eases the financial burden on the parent, as there is no immediate payment required upon the student's arrival. The $500 saved will cover the remaining fees for the semester/year, as specified in the offer letter from the university. What are your thoughts on this?
2/3/24, 12:59 PM - +27 82 605 7855: I think it's a brilliant idea for us due to financial crisis and it helps us to have a good budget even for ourselves.Thanks
2/3/24, 1:05 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to see that we are together so far. With this plan for the next 10 months, I am sure you must be wondering what will happen in the next 10 months, considering you have already secured your scholarship seat with the university due to your hard work in the first 10 months. Is my understanding correct?
2/3/24, 1:06 PM - +27 82 605 7855: Yes
2/3/24, 1:06 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Let me help you with that as well. In the 11th month, you will be guided to open an FBC Mastercard bank account in Zimbabwe with a deposit of $150. The reason for this is that when you apply for your student Visa, the Embassy asks for a Bank Statement, and this account will serve that purpose.
2/3/24, 1:06 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: We understand it might be expensive if you deposit another $1500 for the remaining 10 months in FB  Bank Zimbabwe, so to avoid the same challenges, we have designed the plan accordingly. You will only be depositing for the 11th, 12th, 13th, and 14th month, which is 4 months.
2/3/24, 1:06 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Once the 4 months are completed, our Department of Student Welfare (DSW) team will assist you with your visa process. The bank statement will act as one of the required documents, and once you receive the visa, you can withdraw the amount from FBC and book the flight ticket. This will help you utilize the money as well. How does it sound?
2/3/24, 1:08 PM - +27 82 605 7855: Noted thanks
2/3/24, 1:18 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, from the 16th Month till the 20th month, considering it is a 6-month window, you can again continue depositing the money ($150) with Edoofa which can be used in the fee as and when required or you can decide to save this $900 of these 6 months with you as well. This is something which you are free to choose. I hope you have understood the financial secure plan now?
2/3/24, 1:19 PM - +27 82 605 7855: Okay
2/3/24, 1:29 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That's great. Now that you have all the information, I want you to take some time and discuss the financial security plan with your family members. Help them understand its importance and details. Once you're done, we can reconnect, have a discussion, and address any queries you may have. After resolving your concerns, I'll guide you through starting your financial security plan. 

While most people can discuss this with their family the same day, I understand everyone is different. Could you let me know when you think you'll have the discussion with your family? This way, we can schedule our next session accordingly.
2/3/24, 1:32 PM - +27 82 605 7855: We will let you know maybe  later today or tomorrow.
2/3/24, 1:33 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That's perfectly fine. In that case, we will conclude today's conversation, and I will connect with you on Monday to resume our discussion as Sunday is a non-operational day for us. In the meantime, I hope you'll have a detailed discussion with your family and jot down any questions or thoughts you have regarding the Financial Secure plan.

Wishing you a good day ahead, and please extend our regards to your family.
2/3/24, 1:34 PM - +27 82 605 7855: Thank you so much and we wish you to have a good day too.
4/3/24, 10:53 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Tanyaradzwa,

Please, how are you doing today? With regards to our discussion yesterday, I wanted to reach out and enquire if you are available for us to have a brief conversation?
4/3/24, 11:27 AM - +27 82 605 7855: Hello,
We are all good thanks and how are you?
Yes we can chat,thanks
4/3/24, 11:28 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you are doing well and are available for us to connect with each other. I am doing well, thank you for asking. Before reaching out to you today, I was going through pictures and videos from Edoofa's very first SLICE CON held in January, and that sparked my curiosity about whether you are familiar with what SLICE CON is or not?
4/3/24, 11:33 AM - +27 82 605 7855: Please can you explain what is Slice Con
4/3/24, 11:36 AM - +27 82 605 7855: And you can share us the videos too,thanks
4/3/24, 11:40 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is alright, Let me tell you a bit about the same.  Recently, Edoofa hosted a conference called the Symposium of Leaders, Innovators, and Creators at Edoofa, also known as 'SLICE-CON.'
4/3/24, 11:40 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: The conference was attended by all the Edoofians of 2023 and a few senior Edoofians from previous batches. It focused on the art of creation, innovation, and, most importantly, the mindset required to make an impact in one's career.
4/3/24, 11:40 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: During this Industrial Visit and the conference - SLICE CON, Corporate leaders, such as the CEOs and Co-founders from renowned companies like Rage Coffee, Sirona Hygiene, Jolin New York, and more, shared their insights and experiences. These individuals are at the helm of multi-millionaire brands, leading large marketing teams. Their presence added immense value, providing students with the opportunity to engage in transformative conversations.
4/3/24, 11:41 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Let me share a glimpse of the conference with you and your family. I am certain that Tanyaradzwa too would be this excited to attend such events when he comes to India.

4/3/24, 11:41 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Let me know once you are able to go through the messages about the SLICE CON, along with the images and videos shared with you. This was indeed a momentous step for all of our students, making them employable ready and giving them access to the right opportunities for their careers ahead.
4/3/24, 11:52 AM - +27 82 605 7855: Yes and that was really good and encouraging  to be part of the Edoofians to learn, study, prepare for the industry and also to have a better future.
4/3/24, 11:54 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Certainly, please. Also, regarding the discussion we had the other day about the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan, I wanted to follow up on our last conversation. Have you, as a family, been able to discuss it? If so, I would like to understand how the discussion went. What were their thoughts about it? Did they have any specific queries or concerns that you would like us to address?
4/3/24, 12:09 PM - +27 82 605 7855: They understood it well.So when the Bank Account is opened and all the money will be deposited into the Account and after Tanyaradzwa come to India will that Account still works or it will also stops.
4/3/24, 12:15 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: The account will still be functional, and it will help you in making seamless transfers to Tanyaradzwa for monthly expenses and annual university expenses. I hope this helps?
4/3/24, 12:16 PM - +27 82 605 7855: Noted thanks
4/3/24, 12:23 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: May I know if you have any other queries or thoughts that you would like to share with me?
4/3/24, 12:25 PM - +27 82 605 7855: No everything is clear , thanks.
4/3/24, 12:35 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know, Parents and Tanyaradzwa. For the current round of students, there are only 27 seats available for the students who can benefit from the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan. 

Since you have been one of the most dedicated students, and I see you have great aspirations, I wanted you to be a part of the same set of students and start with your future planning the right way.
4/3/24, 12:36 PM - +27 82 605 7855: Thanks
4/3/24, 12:36 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Also, as this plan commences from the month of March, for the efficient implementation of this plan, we need to decide on a fixed date on which you will deposit $150 every month. This will provide you with the flexibility to align your finances accordingly.
4/3/24, 12:36 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Our complete focus is on providing students and parents with the best ways to avail themselves of these opportunities. We understand that every parent may not be able to make the payment on our specified date. Therefore, considering this situation, we allow them to decide the payment date according to their comfort. In light of the same, may I know the fixed date every month on which you will deposit $150?
4/3/24, 12:39 PM - +27 82 605 7855: We will let you know later after our discussion.
4/3/24, 12:52 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Surely. Could you kindly let me know by when you will be able to have this discussion with your family?

4/3/24, 3:18 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Regarding your EWYL session with Ms. Aditi, she is currently unwell and will be unavailable for the day. I believe she will be able to reconnect with you by tomorrow.
4/3/24, 6:30 PM - +27 82 605 7855: Hello ,we decided the last day of every month, but this month it's a bit challenging because we are paying Tanyaradzwa's A-level examination fees so can we start next month April.
5/3/24, 9:36 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Tanyaradzwa,

I hope you are doing well. Thank your for sharing that information with me. Since you confirmed that you will be able to begin the plan from the month of April instead of March, would it be feasible for you to adjust your first installment amount in the subsequent months? Let me elaborate. You can either make installments of $167 from April to December. Alternatively, you can begin with the regular $150 installments from April and choose a month to adjust the initial $150 installment. Could you kindly let me know if one of these options is suitable for you?
5/3/24, 9:36 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am only asking this because it is crucial to maintain consistency in order to achieve our collective goal - that is to ensure that we are able to save at least $1500 by the end of December towards Tanyaradzwa’s higher education funds. I hope we are together in this?
5/3/24, 9:51 AM - +27 82 605 7855: Good morning
We are all good thanks and how are you?
Yes we can make instalments of 167 dollars from April to December.
