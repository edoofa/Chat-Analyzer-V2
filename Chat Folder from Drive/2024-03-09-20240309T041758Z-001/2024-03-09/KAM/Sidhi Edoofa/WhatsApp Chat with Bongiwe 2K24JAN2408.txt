10/2/24, 2:35 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
10/2/24, 2:35 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
10/2/24, 2:39 PM - +263 78 083 1004: Yes they are clear
10/2/24, 3:14 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps - 

*Step 3: Introduction to the Financial Secure Plan* - Parents with children embarking on their university journey within the next one to two years face important decision-making and rigorous financial planning. Edoofa recognizes the significance of this transition and hence has introduced the Edoofa Secure Plan - a unique and systematic strategy to empower parents in financial planning and preparing for their child's tertiary education well in advance.
10/2/24, 3:14 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Scholarship Offer Letter from the university would be issued next year in the month of August.

I hope you are following?
10/2/24, 3:31 PM - +263 78 083 1004: Yes following....
10/2/24, 4:43 PM - +263 77 523 3547: Yes
12/2/24, 8:11 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Bongiwe.

I hope you had a wonderful weekend. Kindly excuse me for being unable to respond to your last message as our operational hours had already concluded. Before we proceed with our session, I would like to inquire, how are things on your end today?
12/2/24, 8:35 AM - +263 78 083 1004: I understand, morning how are you doing.

Things are fine was kindly requesting we start at 2:00 today  so l can fully participate,l'm at school  currently .
12/2/24, 8:54 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. In such a case, we will continue with our session at 2:00 PM today. Have a good day at school, Bongiwe.

12/2/24, 2:32 PM - +263 78 083 1004: It's been going okay ok
12/2/24, 2:41 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. During our previous discussion, we had discussed the first 4 steps of the admission cycle, leaving us with the last 2 steps. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. The registration fee will be paid through the savings you have accumulated visa the Financial Secure Plan. After the registration fee is paid, for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
12/2/24, 2:41 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
12/2/24, 2:50 PM - +263 77 278 7047: It's  Awesome
12/2/24, 2:50 PM - +263 77 278 7047: yes very  clear  indeed

12/2/24, 2:58 PM - +263 78 083 1004: Following it is clear
12/2/24, 2:59 PM - +263 78 083 1004: Yes
12/2/24, 3:26 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life.

12/2/24, 3:26 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them.

16/2/24, 9:54 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Since the admit cards have been automatically generated through a software, due to some technical error it has mentioned "Do not communicate with fellow candidates during examination" instead of *"Kindly do not communicate with fellow students during the seminar in order to maintain decorum at the event."* 

The ESAT test will be conducted for students commencing their university journey in 2024. As your admission is scheduled for the 2025 intake, you will be eligible to sit for the test next year. I trust this clarifies your query. I hope that this helps with your query?

21/2/24, 10:25 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Hello Bongiwe!

The past three days flew by in a whirlwind for Team Edoofa – both for those in India and those in Harare for the Meet and Greet '24. Now that we've had a chance to catch our breath, I want to extend my sincere gratitude to you for being a part of the event and contributing to its success.

Your insights from the event are highly valued, and I'm keen to hear about your experience. Would you be open to sharing your thoughts, including your interest in attending similar events in the future and any suggestions for improvement? Additionally, if you have captured any memorable moments in photos, we would greatly appreciate you sharing them.

Your perspective is crucial, and I also encourage you to discuss the event with your parents and gather their feedback.
21/2/24, 11:42 AM - +263 78 083 1004: Good morning Sir , it was an honor to be part of that event,okay as for experience it was a great experience  because the meet and greet didn't only give me a chance to visit Harare as it was my first time there but   it also allowed me to hear and see first hand information about India and it's diversity from the people who grow up calling it a home ,and hearing other edoofian's stories and how edoofa has been  beneficial to them, it made me very sure and certain   that l also want to venture in the same journey and from the event the willingness to be a full Edoofian has gone from a100 % to a 110% .I also saw the video on a workshop thingy that the edoofians had  in India where highly respected people from different sectors of  business India had come to furtherly  educate the edoofians on life after getting a degree in their courses and how they can be marketable individuals in terms of business ethics and l highly support such workshops ,l kind of forgot the exact name that was used for the event the edoofians had but l really agree with having more of such events and l am interested in attending similar events in the future , l also understood   more about Edoofa from all the answers from the questions that were asked . I  understood more about the earn while you learn program  and how it works and the companies in collaboration of which this information felt very essential for me to know .
As for suggestions/ improvements l was kindly requesting that we be informed  earlier suppose by a  month or a few weeks  when such events are going to be held so that everyone  manages to be there as there would be more time to budget for transport costs n accommodation for such a trip provided they live very far from the venue or at another different city. Overall l don't have any complaints about the event l loved it especially the videos  made by the edoofians that was the best part of the event for me ,as for memorable moments we took photos with Mr Angad Singh the founder and the admissions officer l'm not sure if it's you or not😅 and we also took a few videos  (by we l'm referring to Michelle Gorekore another enrolled Edoofian and friend of mine l went with of which l haven't taken all the pictures from her as we were using her phone ,now l only have the ones with the admissions officer .

As for my parents l did discuss the event with them however  it's also known that first hand experience is better than second hand and the feeling l had from being in the event will be different from how they visualize it when told however l will be sending their feedback soon .
21/2/24, 11:49 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing such a detailed feedback, Bongiwe. I am pleased to know that you had such an amazing experience; surely our hard work has paid off. I have taken your feedback about the timely invitations and will surely discuss it with the whole team once they reach India.
21/2/24, 1:24 PM - +263 78 083 1004: Okay thank you ,l also wanted to ask about the Earn while you learn program , in last document l filled it was written that l would be starting on the 19th and the orientation on the 22 ,l was just acquiring about when l would hear from you about that.
21/2/24, 2:37 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. Since we had the Meet and Greet Seminar lined up in the past week, our EWYL mentors were also busy with the operations of the event.

26/2/24, 10:35 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Bongiwe,

I hope you had a wonderful weekend. Over the weekend, our team engaged in discussions regarding the Meet and Greet Seminar, reflecting on the valuable insights gained from interacting with our students. The experience was truly enriching for us, and we hope it was equally enjoyable for you as well.

Before we proceed with our discussion today, I would like to inquire how you are doing this fine morning?

26/2/24, 12:50 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. I am doing well, thank you for asking. Previously, I had shared 4 videos with you that had the founders' message. May I know if you were able to go through the same and can share a brief understanding of the same with me? <This message was edited>
28/2/24, 8:52 AM - +263 78 083 1004: My sincere apologies for the late reply ,faced a few difficulties loading the last one  however l have seen them all now and here's what l   noted



They talked about the universities  that are enrolling edoofians them being about 50 or so and   choosen /partnered with after  a thorough  research and seeing if they meet the required  criteria to be classified as part of the best universities /colleges making it assuring that any University an Edoofian is enrolled in is one of the best .
They also stated how for you to reach your goals as an Edoofian you should be open minded and ready to take advantage of any opportunity  no matter the background you come from and feel entitled to being handed everything to you with the feel that you have  been through life's worst ,l also understood that  through the earn while you can earn  scholarship credits and this was designed to create the basis of employability and counter the issue where a student has to do extra jobs to get money to pay for studies whilst there main focus  is to push and focus on getting the required degree.These credits  can be  $20-100 and by dedicating 2-3hrs a day n consulting
28/2/24, 12:23 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Bongiwe,

I hope you are having a lovely day. Thank you for sharing your understanding of the videos with me. Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose. I hope you were able to follow through with this?
28/2/24, 12:31 PM - +263 77 523 3547: Thank you so much
28/2/24, 12:34 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: You are most welcome. Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the task by tomorrow before our session.
28/2/24, 12:35 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

https://goo.gl/forms/iWss6zPuOFbnGTXK2
28/2/24, 12:35 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Along with the form, I want you to share the following documents with us as they are required for your university application preparation:

*1. A-Level Result or Letter of Recommendation or Statement of Entry (A-Level).*

*2. O-Level Results*

*3. Identity proof (International Traveling Passport or National ID or Birth Certificate)*
28/2/24, 1:09 PM - +263 78 083 1004: I haven't written A level yet l l'm sitting for my exams  this year November
28/2/24, 1:13 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand that you are yet to sit for your A-Level examinations. In such a case, as a part of your application file, you will need to visit your school and secure a letter of recommendation from them. We have attached a sample document to help guide you through the process.
28/2/24, 1:13 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
28/2/24, 1:13 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Here are some key points to consider when requesting the letter from your school:

1. *Visit Your School*: Approach your school administration or the designated authority for issuing such letters.

2. *Provide Necessary Information*: Ensure that the drafted letter includes essential details such as your identity as a student of the school, *your subject combination for A Level exams*, and your intention to sit for the exams this academic year.

3. *Printing and Signing*: Request the school to print the letter on official letterhead and have it signed/stamped by the appropriate authority.

4. *Include Authority Details*: Ensure that the letter contains the details of the signing authority, including their full name, contact number, and email ID.
28/2/24, 1:13 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This letter of recommendation is a crucial document that will support your application process. The Edoofa Academic Board will use those details to reach out to your school authorities and verify the recommendation letter before adding it to your scholarship application and hence I would like to inquire by when will you be able to share the same document with us?
28/2/24, 1:21 PM - +263 78 083 1004: When exactly am l supposed to  share it with you, after getting the results or sometime around this period
28/2/24, 1:31 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: You are required to submit the same at this time to proceed with your application process, as it will act as an alternate to your A-Level statement of entry. Once you appear for your examinations and receive your results, you will be required to share the results with us for further evaluation of your application profile. I hope helps?
28/2/24, 1:32 PM - +263 78 083 1004: Yes it does help thank you ,well noted
28/2/24, 1:35 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Once you share these documents and complete the task that has been provided to you, we will have completed the second step of your university admission process. At that point, we will be prepared to move on to the third step, which involves Introduction to the Financial Secure Plan. Hence, could you kindly confirm when you will be able to complete these tasks and reconnect with us? This will allow us to schedule our discussion accordingly.
28/2/24, 1:37 PM - +263 78 083 1004: On this one l'm not sure it will depend on my school   however may we just say a week for now
28/2/24, 1:47 PM - +263 77 278 7047: Afternoon  we  gud thanks
28/2/24, 2:04 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand. That is alright please. However, it is essential that you complete the SOP form by tomorrow before our session and share a screenshot of the "submitted" page with me, and it will only take about 30 minutes of your time. I hope we are together in this?
28/2/24, 2:07 PM - +263 78 083 1004: Yes we are noted

I hope you are having a pleasant day. How has your day been going so far?
1/3/24, 10:32 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: https://chat.whatsapp.com/JwbGgWr1D0iH0S2ts1dcZi

Kindly find the attached link for your EWYL group.
1/3/24, 10:45 AM - +263 77 523 3547: Thank uou so much we are fine thank you also for the link
1/3/24, 10:45 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: You are most welcome, please. May I know if you were able to fill the online SOP form and could also share the documents please?
1/3/24, 11:30 AM - +263 78 083 1004: <Media omitted>
1/3/24, 11:37 AM - +263 78 083 1004: Yes l filled the SOP and the recommendation they l will be able to have it by Monday ,l was supposed to have it today however they said they are busy with today's SASAF another event at school
1/3/24, 11:37 AM - +263 78 083 1004: Morning l'm doing fine and you.
1/3/24, 11:39 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the screenshot with me. I understand please. In such a case, kindly share the documents with me once you have received it from the school.

With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey, i.e. *Introduction to Financial Secure Plan*.
1/3/24, 11:40 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: However, before we start the same, I was going through your scholarship application file and noticed that you are supposed to make the payment of your remaining part of Edoofa Enrollment fee. Hence, I thought of sharing a gentle reminder with you and trying to understand how your preparation has been so far? Have you been able to align your preparations in the right direction?
1/3/24, 11:42 AM - +263 78 083 1004: Yes l'm paying that today
1/3/24, 11:49 AM - +263 78 083 1004: That is l have $110 today right now  n l'm going to deposit it then deposit the rest again after converting the ZWL dollar into USD
1/3/24, 11:54 AM - +263 77 523 3547: Thank you we are working on that wil forward proof of payment today
1/3/24, 1:55 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know.

In the meantime, Let us move forward with our discussion. To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is B.Sc (Cardiovascular Technology) and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2025. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
1/3/24, 2:04 PM - +263 78 083 1004: Yes it's true
1/3/24, 2:18 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. Based on our experience of over 14 years and having assisted over 5000 students from different countries, we have realized that financial planning is the most important factor when a student plans for their higher education abroad.
1/3/24, 2:18 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am sure that you must be aware that 20-30% of students who are admitted into universities abroad are unable to fulfill their dream and come to India due to a lack of financial planning. The funds needed for booking flights, accommodation, and covering living expenses after arrival often become overwhelming, leading to the decision to defer their admission for a year. This, in turn, creates a gap in the child's education.
1/3/24, 2:18 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: To assist both students and parents in this regard, Edoofa Management has designed a Financial Secure Plan that aims to help you prepare for your higher educational finances without experiencing stress or last-minute rushes. I believe you must be wondering about the details of the same plan and how it helps the parents?
1/3/24, 3:07 PM - +263 78 083 1004: Yes l am
1/3/24, 4:20 PM - +263 77 278 7047: Afternoon   tats a wonderful  plan  thank  yu
1/3/24, 4:41 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Edoofa Secure Plan is important for parents who have children joining the university for tertiary education in the next one to two years for several reasons:
1/3/24, 4:41 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 1. *Financial Preparedness:* The Edoofa Secure plan helps parents prepare financially for the costs after the Scholarship being offered so that they are not caught off guard.

2. *Reduced Financial Stress:* Having the Edoofa Secure Plan in place can significantly reduce the financial stress on you as parents when your child is about to enter university. Knowing that there is a dedicated fund for education expenses provides peace of mind.
1/3/24, 4:41 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 3. *Avoiding Debt*: Without proper savings, some parents may resort to taking out loans or accumulating credit card debt to cover their child's education costs. This Educational savings plan helps avoid the burden of debt and high-interest payments.

4. *Compound Interest:* By starting to save early and consistently contributing to the savings plan, parents can take advantage of compound interest, which can significantly increase the amount available for education expenses.
1/3/24, 4:41 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 5. *Flexibility and Control:* The Edoofa Secure savings plans allow parents to have greater control over their finances and how they allocate funds for their child's education. They can choose investment options that align with their risk tolerance and financial goals.

6. *Encouraging Responsibility*: Involving your child in the process of saving for their education teaches them financial responsibility and the value of higher education. It also motivates them to outperform in Academics.
1/3/24, 4:41 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 7. *Adapting to Unexpected Changes*: Life is full of surprises, and circumstances can change especially when there are political reforms changing each day impacting the Local Currency. Having an Edoofa Secure Plan allows parents to adapt to unexpected changes in their financial situation while still prioritizing their child's education.

8. *Peace of Mind:* Overall, having the Edoofa Secure plan provides parents with peace of mind, knowing that they are actively planning for their child's future and increasing the likelihood of providing them with a solid education.
1/3/24, 4:41 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, when you go through all the above benefits, I am sure you can see that the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan is an important financial tool for parents/students who are supposed to enter the university soon. 

It helps ensure that the financial aspect of tertiary education is well-managed, reduces stress, and allows parents to provide the best opportunities for their children without resorting to debt or financial hardship. Isn't this something you and your family also wish to have?
1/3/24, 4:44 PM - +263 77 278 7047: Well  said  true  indeed.
1/3/24, 4:47 PM - +263 77 278 7047: lt increases  flexibility  of the child  while  learning  without  any constraints.
1/3/24, 7:07 PM - +263 78 083 1004: <Media omitted>
2/3/24, 10:40 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Bongiwe,

I hope you are having a pleasant Saturday morning. Thank you for sharing the payment receipt for your remaining enrollment fees. I have duly taken a note of it.
2/3/24, 10:41 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now that you have gone through the above points, do you want me to help you understand how the Edoofa Secure Plan works?
2/3/24, 12:05 PM - +263 78 083 1004: Yes please
2/3/24, 12:22 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, as you are aware, we are currently in March 2024, and we have a good 20 months to plan for your finances before you start your university education in 2025.
2/3/24, 12:22 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: During the counseling session, you were informed that at Edoofa, we guarantee a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship on the tuition fees. Hence, the cost of education, including food and accommodation after the scholarship, would be between $2000-$3000, and it could be even less. Not more than that.
2/3/24, 12:22 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This means that if you can save $150 per month for the next 20 months, you will be able to save $3000. This amount is more than enough for the first year of university fees, including tuition fees (if any), food, and accommodation. I hope you agree with this?
2/3/24, 12:39 PM - +263 78 083 1004: Yes
2/3/24, 12:40 PM - +263 77 523 3547: Yes
2/3/24, 12:45 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Right, this means that by the time you would be in India, you would have already saved the $3000 that will cover the first-year fee.
2/3/24, 12:45 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, in these next 20 months, I am sure you would also be engaged in the EWYL program, and if you secure a minimum of $1000 in 20 months, that means the fees for 1.5 years are already secured.
2/3/24, 12:45 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, for a 3-year course, if we follow the same approach for the remaining 1.5 years, the educational journey for the student and the financial journey for the parent will be easy and smooth. I believe you must be able to see this perspective?
2/3/24, 12:53 PM - +263 77 523 3547: Yes thank you  for sharing this much appreciated.
2/3/24, 12:59 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. With that said, there is also another benefit, I am sure being in Zimbabwe you know how drastically the exchange rate fluctuates.
2/3/24, 12:59 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: If you are buying a dollar today, you might be spending 7000 bonds, but if you buy a dollar after a month, the rate would be different.
2/3/24, 12:59 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Also, even if you choose to buy dollars every month and save at your home, it is not safe since there is news of robbery, and mugging every day.
2/3/24, 12:59 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: In that case, you will opt to save in the Bank, but again we know that savings in the Bank require a Nostro Account which means you have to pay the bank to keep your money safe, right?
2/3/24, 1:19 PM - +263 77 523 3547: Yes, informative  thank you so much.
2/3/24, 1:19 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is great to hear. Considering these constraints, Edoofa Management has decided to help the parents and students prepare for the journey way ahead of time by helping them save money with Edoofa without any additional charges but rather saving additional money as well. Do you want me to explain how this has been achieved?
2/3/24, 1:35 PM - +263 77 278 7047: yes
2/3/24, 1:36 PM - +263 77 523 3547: yes
2/3/24, 1:37 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Program Fee (Enrollment Fee) that you were asked to pay is $350. Under the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan, a parent has to deposit a small amount of money which is $150 every month for the next 10 months. That means, in 10 months, the money saved will be $1500.
2/3/24, 1:37 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That means, in 10 months, the money saved will be $1500. When this money is saved, Edoofa will waive off $150 from the Edoofa Program/Enrollment Fee of $350, thereby making a straight saving of $150 in 10 months.
2/3/24, 1:37 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Imagine you paying $15 every month to the Bank of Zimbabwe to keep your money safe, and here Edoofa is paying you $15 every month to keep your money safe. Now, you must be wondering, why only for 10 months and not for 20 months, right?
2/3/24, 1:38 PM - +263 77 278 7047: Tats interesting  indeed
2/3/24, 1:38 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: If you see the bigger picture, you will realize that the reason is quite simple. Upon the completion of the 10 installments, the Edoofa Admissions team will initiate the Child’s Admission Process by applying early to the universities to secure their scholarship and their university seat.
2/3/24, 1:38 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Reserving seats earlier increases the chances of obtaining a maximum scholarship. A higher scholarship means lower fees, and by securing the seat, you will be entitled to pay the fees as per the old fee structure of the university, not the new one implemented in January 2025. Furthermore, when applying to the universities, you will receive an offer letter or a letter of intent detailing the fees, scholarship, and registration fees.
2/3/24, 1:38 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: As explained during the enrollment process, the registration fee is a portion of your first-year university fee, paid to reserve the seat. It ranges from $500-$1000 and is not an additional fee. 

From the $1500 you saved with Edoofa, the registration fee will be paid to the university, securing the seat. For instance, if the registration fee is $1000, Edoofa will pay $1000 from the $1500 saved in 10 months. The updated balance with Edoofa will be $500, which will be paid to the university upon your arrival in India.
2/3/24, 1:39 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This eases the financial burden on the parent, as there is no immediate payment required upon the student's arrival. The $500 saved will cover the remaining fees for the semester/year, as specified in the offer letter from the university. What are your thoughts on this?
2/3/24, 1:41 PM - +263 77 278 7047: Well  understood  it relieves a burden  to parents  nd the student.
2/3/24, 1:42 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to see that we are together so far. With this plan for the next 10 months, I am sure you must be wondering what will happen in the next 10 months, considering you have already secured your scholarship seat with the university due to your hard work in the first 10 months. Is my understanding correct?
2/3/24, 1:44 PM - +263 77 278 7047: yes please
2/3/24, 1:45 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Let me help you with that as well. In the 11th month, you will be guided to open an FBC Mastercard bank account in Zimbabwe with a deposit of $150. The reason for this is that when you apply for your student Visa, the Embassy asks for a Bank Statement, and this account will serve that purpose.
2/3/24, 1:45 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: We understand it might be expensive if you deposit another $1500 for the remaining 10 months in FB  Bank Zimbabwe, so to avoid the same challenges, we have designed the plan accordingly. You will only be depositing for the 11th, 12th, 13th, and 14th month, which is 4 months.
2/3/24, 1:45 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Once the 4 months are completed, our Department of Student Welfare (DSW) team will assist you with your visa process. The bank statement will act as one of the required documents, and once you receive the visa, you can withdraw the amount from FBC and book the flight ticket. This will help you utilize the money as well. How does it sound?
2/3/24, 1:48 PM - +263 77 278 7047: ok understood  how  much is a visa ticket  total  amount?
2/3/24, 1:49 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Visa processing costs $83 and flight tickets range from $400 to $500.

Now, from the 16th Month till the 20th month, considering it is a 6-month window, you can again continue depositing the money ($150) with Edoofa which can be used in the fee as and when required or you can decide to save this $900 of these 6 months with you as well. This is something which you are free to choose. I hope you have understood the financial secure plan now?
2/3/24, 1:51 PM - +263 77 278 7047: yes  the savings will help  to cover up some  expenses  required.
2/3/24, 1:52 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That's great. Now that you have all the information, I want you to take some time and discuss the financial security plan with your family members. Help them understand its importance and details. Once you're done, we can reconnect, have a discussion, and address any queries you may have. After resolving your concerns, I'll guide you through starting your financial security plan. 

While most people can discuss this with their family the same day, I understand everyone is different. Could you let me know when you think you'll have the discussion with your family? This way, we can schedule our next session accordingly.
2/3/24, 1:53 PM - +263 77 278 7047: ok will  update  yu
2/3/24, 1:56 PM - +263 77 278 7047: Thanks  so much  for the discussion  hv a blessed  dy

2/3/24, 2:14 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That's perfectly fine. In that case, we will conclude today's conversation, and I will connect with you on Monday to resume our discussion. In the meantime, I hope you'll have a detailed discussion with your family and jot down any questions or thoughts you have regarding the Financial Secure plan.

Wishing you a good day ahead, and please extend our regards to your family.
2/3/24, 2:18 PM - +263 77 278 7047: ok noted  thank yu l really  appreciate  for the info  l hv received  we will  definitely  discuss  in detail  as a family

2/3/24, 3:03 PM - +263 78 083 1004: Yes
4/3/24, 10:53 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Bongiwe,

Please, how are you doing today? With regards to our discussion on Saturday, I wanted to reach out and enquire if you are available for us to have a brief conversation?
4/3/24, 12:00 PM - +263 77 523 3547: Yes we are available thank you
4/3/24, 12:12 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you are available for us to connect with each other. Before reaching out to you today, I was going through pictures and videos from Edoofa's very first SLICE CON held in January, and that sparked my curiosity about whether you are familiar with what SLICE CON is or not?
4/3/24, 12:21 PM - +263 78 083 1004: Yes l am isn't it that event the edoofians went to India,l saw clips n videos of it
4/3/24, 12:24 PM - +263 78 083 1004: *in

4/3/24, 12:39 PM - +263 78 083 1004: Yes ,yes please
4/3/24, 12:41 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Before we move ahead, I have an exciting opportunity that I would like to share with you!

Today, I was actually having a conversation with Mr. Anik Batish who is the Head of the Career Development Cell at Edoofa and during that conversation he mentioned that he has an exciting collaboration opportunity in mind for which he wants to connect with you and your parents today. So, he will reach out to you today on your personal number to take the discussion further. I hope you are able to get in touch with him and discuss more about the opportunity.
4/3/24, 12:44 PM - +263 78 083 1004: Yes l will be looking forward to it
4/3/24, 12:48 PM - +263 77 523 3547: Noted with thank you
4/3/24, 1:10 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Let me tell you a bit about the SLICE CON.  Recently, Edoofa hosted a conference called the Symposium of Leaders, Innovators, and Creators at Edoofa, also known as 'SLICE-CON.'
4/3/24, 1:10 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: The conference was attended by all the Edoofians of 2023 and a few senior Edoofians from previous batches. It focused on the art of creation, innovation, and, most importantly, the mindset required to make an impact in one's career.
4/3/24, 1:10 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: During this Industrial Visit and the conference - SLICE CON, Corporate leaders, such as the CEOs and Co-founders from renowned companies like Rage Coffee, Sirona Hygiene, Jolin New York, and more, shared their insights and experiences. These individuals are at the helm of multi-millionaire brands, leading large marketing teams. Their presence added immense value, providing students with the opportunity to engage in transformative conversations.
4/3/24, 1:11 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Let me share a glimpse of the conference with you and your family. I am certain that Bongiwe too would be this excited to attend such events when she comes to India.
4/3/24, 1:11 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>

4/3/24, 1:38 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Certainly, please. Also, regarding the discussion we had the other day about the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan, I wanted to follow up on our last conversation. Have you, as a family, been able to discuss it? If so, I would like to understand how the discussion went. What were their thoughts about it? Did they have any specific queries or concerns that you would like us to address?
4/3/24, 1:51 PM - +263 77 278 7047: Afternoon  we gud.thanks
4/3/24, 1:55 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that you are doing good. May I know if you were able to go through my previous message and if you have any queries regarding the Financial Secure Plan?
4/3/24, 2:00 PM - +263 77 523 3547: Yes we did, Financial Sucure Plan opened our minds wide, we discussed as a family. One issue we thought much about was depositing of $150 dollars every month feel its bit high considering flatuation of rates.However its the best plan. We also thought of opening Fbc forex a/c if possible early. Issue of Visa its good plan we have no issues on that. If it happens we skip to deposit something we might recover from period of January to june when Bongiwe will be on  break not going to sch.
4/3/24, 2:13 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. As previously discussed, Bongiwe's application profile will be processed under early-applications. To secure her scholarship seat, the registration fees ($500 to $1000) will be due in August 2024 upon receiving an offer letter. In such a case, I would like to give you an insight that saving the first $1000 should be our priority and as we move forward, you can let us know if you are facing any financial difficulties and we can discuss and find a solution for the same. I hope we are together in this?
4/3/24, 2:15 PM - +263 77 523 3547: clear on this one thank yu
4/3/24, 2:20 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know, Parents and Bongiwe. For the current round of students, there are only 27 seats available for the students who can benefit from the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan. 

Since you have been one of the most dedicated students, and I see you have great aspirations, I wanted you to be a part of the same set of students and start with your future planning the right way.
4/3/24, 2:20 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Also, as this plan commences from the month of March, for the efficient implementation of this plan, we need to decide on a fixed date on which you will deposit $150 every month. This will provide you with the flexibility to align your finances accordingly.
4/3/24, 2:21 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Our complete focus is on providing students and parents with the best ways to avail themselves of these opportunities. We understand that every parent may not be able to make the payment on our specified date. Therefore, considering this situation, we allow them to decide the payment date according to their comfort. In light of the same, may I know the fixed date every month on which you will deposit $150?
4/3/24, 2:32 PM - +263 77 278 7047: oooh  we really  appreciate  that   ma'am 🙏
4/3/24, 2:49 PM - +263 78 083 1004: Can l ask isn't my University admission on August 2025 meaning that  l should be getting an offer letter somewhere then after using A level results
4/3/24, 2:54 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Since you have enrolled with us and taken a step in the right direction towards your higher education journey, we will be processing your profile under early applications in the month of August 2024, such that you are promptly able to secure your scholarship seat in the best university. In such a case, your offer letter will be issued to you in the coming August itself. I hope this helps in making the admission process clearer?

4/3/24, 3:15 PM - +263 77 523 3547: For the one which commences from the month of march was seeking advice if its possible to pay in April considering this month will be paying school examination fees.
4/3/24, 3:24 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. Since you shared that you will be able to begin the plan from the month of April instead of March, would it be feasible for you to adjust your first installment amount in the subsequent months? Let me elaborate. You can either make installments of $167 from April to December. Alternatively, you can begin with the regular $150 installments from April and choose a month to adjust the initial $150 installment. Could you kindly let me know if one of these options is suitable for you?
4/3/24, 3:25 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Our collective goal is to ensure that we are able to save $1500 by the end of December for Bongiwe's higher education. I hope that we are on the same page regarding the importance of consistency in the savings and ensuring that you do not face any challenges later on when it is time for the payment of Bongiwe's registration amount.
4/3/24, 3:35 PM - +263 77 523 3547: Thank yu we are opting $150 month of April then choose month to adjust by end of December achieve $1500
4/3/24, 3:40 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing these details, your commitment to securing a seat in this exclusive program is appreciated.

To proceed with the next steps, we will be sharing an official agreement detailing the specifics of the Financial Secure Plan along with its benefits. This agreement is a crucial document that outlines the terms and conditions of your participation in the program. It serves as a legal framework ensuring transparency and mutual understanding between all parties involved.
4/3/24, 3:40 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: As we prepare to send you the agreement, we kindly request the following details to personalize the document:

1. Full Name of Parent/Guardian/Sponsor responsible for catering to the student's finances [The representative in whose name you want the agreement to be]

2. Residential Address of the aforementioned representative.
4/3/24, 3:40 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Providing accurate and up-to-date information is essential to ensure the seamless processing of your enrollment in the Financial Secure Plan. Once we receive these details, we will quickly ask the team to share the agreement with you for your review and signature.
