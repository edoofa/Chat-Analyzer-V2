28/12/23, 8:26 PM - +263 73 875 6176: Well to my own understanding the four videos made by the co founders of the edoofa scholarship program are to educate the edoofians more about the program and to ensure them that the program is associated with the best universities in India and also to make us understand about the statement of purpose
28/12/23, 8:28 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. I did go through your responses and I can see you did understand all the videos. 

*Video 1: Important Message for Enrolled Students*

The first video underscores the importance of two crucial qualities: open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions. Edoofa's vision for its students is to foster success in their careers, and promote responsibility, and independence. A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.
28/12/23, 8:28 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s Vision for You*

Edoofa's vision for its students is to provide them with employment opportunities and the skills necessary to become future leaders. The program places students above other candidates by investing significant time and effort into finding reputable, education-focused institutions rather than solely business-oriented ones.
28/12/23, 8:28 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

In the third video, it is highlighted that Edoofa's founders have dedicated over a decade to meticulously identifying reputable educational institutions. Students are advised to cultivate the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to excel in the job market. All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to student's career goals.
28/12/23, 8:28 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools. It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.
28/12/23, 8:28 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: In summary, these videos emphasize the significance of qualities such as open-mindedness, following instructions, and cooperation. Edoofa's vision is to empower students for successful careers and leadership roles by carefully selecting educational institutions. The SOP is a vital tool for effective communication and admission success. 

I hope you agree with all of this and were able to understand these by watching the four videos?
28/12/23, 8:32 PM - +263 73 875 6176: Yes sir l agree and was able to understand
28/12/23, 8:34 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Brilliant, Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.

So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by Tomorrow 6:30 PM.
28/12/23, 8:34 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded.

12/1/24, 11:01 AM - Dev Edoofa: With that being said, what I can do right now to solve this constraint is give you the freedom to choose the time slot for our sessions over the next 10 days [till 20th January].

I hope you are all doing great today. I understand please. Since this is the first time we are interacting, allow me to introduce myself. I am Miss Siddhi Singh, your Admission Officer. I belong from the vibrant city of Varanasi, known as one of the oldest living cities globally, Beyond my passion for education, I find joy in music and playing basketball. It is my pleasure to assist and guide you through the admission process, ensuring you achieve your dream education in India with the support of Edoofa.
1/2/24, 9:29 PM - +263 73 875 6176: Thank you ma'am it's a pleasure to know you we hope to work with you
2/2/24, 2:04 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Tendai.

I hope you are having a wonderful day. It is my pleasure too. I understand that Tendai has school during the weekdays and you are occupied with work. In such a case, I want to ensure that our sessions are held in a timely and smooth manner so we can comfortably proceed with your application process. Could you kindly suggest a 1-hour slot between 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM when we can have our sessions?
2/2/24, 8:14 PM - +263 73 875 6176: 3pm to 5pm ma'am
2/2/24, 8:29 PM - +263 77 387 0363: Yes 3-5pm I agree
2/2/24, 8:36 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that. In such a case, we will have our daily session during that time. However, tomorrow my operational hours are going to be from 8:00 AM to 1:00 PM as it is a Saturday. I will reconnect with you during the day tomorrow and I hope that you will be available to proceed with our discussion.

I wish you a blessed evening ahead! <This message was edited>
2/2/24, 8:55 PM - +263 73 875 6176: Thank you ma'am
3/2/24, 10:01 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Tendai. How are you all doing this fine morning?
5/2/24, 3:17 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Tendai.

I hope you all had a great weekend. How is everything on your end today?
5/2/24, 3:38 PM - +263 77 367 8482: We fine how are you doing
5/2/24, 3:45 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. I am well too, thank you for asking. I was going through Tendai's application profile and it is my understanding that you have successfully completed the 2nd step of the admission cycle i.e., Statement of Purpose. May I know if I am correct?
5/2/24, 4:20 PM - +263 73 875 6176: Yes
5/2/24, 4:20 PM - +263 73 875 6176: Sir
5/2/24, 4:43 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for confirming that. Let us move forward with our discussion. To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is B.Tech (Computer Science Engineering) and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2025. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
5/2/24, 4:44 PM - +263 73 875 6176: Yes it is sir
5/2/24, 5:20 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: You are conversing with Miss Siddhi, Tendai. I believe you addressed me as sir mistakenly.

Thank you for your confirmation. Based on our experience of over 14 years and having assisted over 5000 students from different countries, we have realized that financial planning is the most important factor when a student plans for their higher education abroad.
5/2/24, 5:20 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am sure that you must be aware that 20-30% of students who are admitted into universities abroad are unable to fulfill their dream and come to India due to a lack of financial planning. The funds needed for booking flights, accommodation, and covering living expenses after arrival often become overwhelming, leading to the decision to defer their admission for a year. This, in turn, creates a gap in the child's education.
5/2/24, 5:20 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: To assist both students and parents in this regard, Edoofa Management has designed a Financial Secure Plan that aims to help you prepare for your higher educational finances without experiencing stress or last-minute rushes. I believe you must be wondering about the details of the same plan and how it helps the parents?
5/2/24, 5:41 PM - +263 73 875 6176: Yes
5/2/24, 5:42 PM - +263 73 875 6176: Sorry ma'am it was a mistake and would not happen again
5/2/24, 5:50 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: It's alright please. I completely understand. I would love to continue with our discussion about the Financial Secure Plan, however, my operational hours for the day have concluded and I have had a long day already. Let us conclude our conversation here and we will reconnect tomorrow at our scheduled time to further discuss the Financial Secure Plan.

Have a blessed day ahead!
6/2/24, 11:13 AM - +263 77 387 0363: Same to you thank you
6/2/24, 2:56 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Tendai.

I hope that you are all doing wonderful today. How has your day been going so far?
6/2/24, 4:33 PM - +263 73 875 6176: It was great ma'am thank you
6/2/24, 4:54 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. In our previous discussion, I was talking about the various constraints that students and parents face, and how the Edoofa management has come up with a solution for the same.
6/2/24, 4:54 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Edoofa Secure Plan is important for parents who have children joining the university for tertiary education in the next one to two years for several reasons:
6/2/24, 4:54 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 1. *Financial Preparedness:* The Edoofa Secure plan helps parents prepare financially for the costs after the Scholarship being offered so that they are not caught off guard.

2. *Reduced Financial Stress:* Having the Edoofa Secure Plan in place can significantly reduce the financial stress on you as parents when your child is about to enter university. Knowing that there is a dedicated fund for education expenses provides peace of mind.
6/2/24, 4:54 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 3. *Avoiding Debt*: Without proper savings, some parents may resort to taking out loans or accumulating credit card debt to cover their child's education costs. This Educational savings plan helps avoid the burden of debt and high-interest payments.

4. *Compound Interest:* By starting to save early and consistently contributing to the savings plan, parents can take advantage of compound interest, which can significantly increase the amount available for education expenses.
6/2/24, 4:54 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 5. *Flexibility and Control:* The Edoofa Secure savings plans allow parents to have greater control over their finances and how they allocate funds for their child's education. They can choose investment options that align with their risk tolerance and financial goals.

6. *Encouraging Responsibility*: Involving your child in the process of saving for their education teaches them financial responsibility and the value of higher education. It also motivates them to outperform in Academics.
6/2/24, 4:54 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 7. *Adapting to Unexpected Changes*: Life is full of surprises, and circumstances can change especially when there are political reforms changing each day impacting the Local Currency. Having an Edoofa Secure Plan allows parents to adapt to unexpected changes in their financial situation while still prioritizing their child's education.

8. *Peace of Mind:* Overall, having the Edoofa Secure plan provides parents with peace of mind, knowing that they are actively planning for their child's future and increasing the likelihood of providing them with a solid education.
6/2/24, 4:54 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, when you go through all the above benefits, I am sure you can see that the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan is an important financial tool for parents/students who are supposed to enter the university soon. 

It helps ensure that the financial aspect of tertiary education is well-managed, reduces stress, and allows parents to provide the best opportunities for their children without resorting to debt or financial hardship. Isn't this something you and your family also wish to have?
6/2/24, 5:29 PM - +263 73 875 6176: Yes it is ma'am ut is a great plan
6/2/24, 5:29 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through the above points, allow me to help you understand how the Edoofa Secure Plan works. As you are aware, we are currently in February 2024, and we have a good 20 months to plan for your finances before you start your university education in 2025.
6/2/24, 5:29 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: During the counseling session, you were informed that at Edoofa, we guarantee a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship on the tuition fees. Hence, the cost of education, including food and accommodation after the scholarship, would be between $2000-$3000, and it could be even less. Not more than that.
6/2/24, 5:29 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This means that if you can save $150 per month for the next 20 months, you will be able to save $3000. This amount is more than enough for the first year of university fees, including tuition fees (if any), food, and accommodation. I hope you agree with this?
6/2/24, 5:35 PM - +263 73 875 6176: Yes
6/2/24, 5:35 PM - +263 73 875 6176: This message was deleted
6/2/24, 5:48 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. I would like to continue with our discussion however my operational hours ended at 5:00 PM. Hence, let us conclude our conversation for today and we will reconnect at our scheduled time tomorrow to continue with our discussion.

Have a blessed evening!
7/2/24, 11:00 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Tendai

I hope this message finds you well and filled with the same excitement that's buzzing here at Edoofa! It's that time of the year again when we eagerly anticipate our annual Meet and Greet Seminar in Harare. This event holds a special place in our hearts as it brings us closer to our community, and we're counting down the days with great anticipation!
7/2/24, 11:00 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Just like clockwork, we're gearing up for the seminar next week, and I couldn't resist sharing our enthusiasm with you. Your presence would truly make the event all the more meaningful, guiding you on your journey to India. Hence, with immense joy, we wanted to extend the special invitation for the Meet and Greet Seminar to you and your wonderful family.
7/2/24, 11:00 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: And in the process of doing the same, I happened to notice that you haven't started your EWYL Program by now. In light of this, I had a discussion with Ms. Sanjana, the head of the EWYL Department, and I am happy to share that she has graciously agreed to make a special exception for you, expediting your application process.
7/2/24, 11:00 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: As a result, I have gone ahead and created your very own dedicated EWYL Group - *Tendai EWYL23E0933*, adding both you and your parents to the mix. If I have missed including any other family members, they can easily join using the following link: [https://chat.whatsapp.com/DY83FqCW6va2ilH4KiCxXh].

Within the group, the EWYL team will not only guide you on the hows and whens of the EWYL Program but also share all the exciting details about the upcoming Meet and Greet Seminar in Harare. We are genuinely thrilled to witness you embark on this transformative journey, and we are rooting for your success every step of the way!

Warmest regards,
Admissions Team.
7/2/24, 9:53 PM - +263 77 387 0363: Thank you ma'am
When and where exactly is the seminar in Harare
9/2/24, 11:48 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Tendai.

I hope you are having a wonderful day. Our team will soon reach out to you with more details about the event. We sincerely hope that you will be able to attend the event. Before we proceed with our session, I would like to check in and ask how you are doing today?
9/2/24, 11:48 AM - +263 73 875 6176: We are great ma'am
9/2/24, 1:21 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. During our previous session, we were discussing about how the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan works. Allow me to proceed with our discussion -
9/2/24, 1:21 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Right, this means that by the time you would be in India, you would have already saved the $3000 that will cover the first-year fee.
9/2/24, 1:21 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, in these next 20 months, I am sure you would also be engaged in the EWYL program, and if you secure a minimum of $1000 in 20 months, that means the fees for 1.5 years are already secured.
9/2/24, 1:21 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, for a 3-year course, if we follow the same approach for the remaining 1.5 years, the educational journey for the student and the financial journey for the parent will be easy and smooth. I believe you must be able to see this perspective?
9/2/24, 8:00 PM - +263 73 875 6176: Yes ma'am
10/2/24, 1:11 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Tendai.

I trust you are having a delightful weekend. On this pleasant Saturday afternoon, I hope you are presently available for a discussion. Before we begin, I would like to check in and ask how are things with you today?
11/2/24, 12:15 AM - +263 77 387 0363: Thank you ma'am we are all fine and in God's hands
12/2/24, 8:16 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Tendai.

I hope you had a wonderful weekend. Before we proceed with our session, I would like to inquire, how is everything on your end today?

16/2/24, 6:42 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Duly noted
22/2/24, 1:38 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Tendai,

I hope you are all doing great. It has been a while since we last connected, and our team has had quite hectic past few days. As you already know, over the past three days, Team Edoofa has been bustling with activity – both in India and Harare for the Meet and Greet '24. Now that things have settled down a bit, I wanted to express my sincere gratitude to you for participating in the event and playing a role in its success. I would like to share a few glimpses of the seminar with you, which demonstrates how enthusiastic and engaged our students were!
22/2/24, 1:38 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>

Would you be willing to share your thoughts, including your interest in attending similar events in the future and any suggestions for improvement? Moreover, if you've captured any memorable moments in photos, we would greatly appreciate it if you could share them with us.
22/2/24, 3:05 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I would also like to inform you that since we just had our Meet and Greet Seminar over the past weekend, as a team we are going to analyze and recalibrate our students' feedback and experience during the next 2 days and plan our way forward. Therefore, we will be unavailable during this time on Friday and Saturday. Let us conclude our discussion here for today, and we will resume our sessions on Monday.

Until then, I wish you a blessed week ahead. Kindly convey my regards to your family as well. <This message was edited>
26/2/24, 10:20 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Tendai,

I hope you had a wonderful weekend. Over the weekend, our team engaged in discussions regarding the Meet and Greet Seminar, reflecting on the valuable insights gained from interacting with our students. The experience was truly enriching for us, and we hope it was equally enjoyable for you as well.

Before we proceed with our discussion today, I would like to inquire how you are doing this fine morning?
26/2/24, 10:31 AM - +263 77 367 8482: very fine ,how are you
26/2/24, 10:32 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. I am doing well, thank you for asking. May I know if you were able to go through my previous messages about the Meet and Greet Seminar and can share your experience with me?
26/2/24, 10:35 AM - +263 77 367 8482: let me revisit the information and share with you
26/2/24, 10:47 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Surely!
27/2/24, 10:04 PM - +263 77 387 0363: Yes we were there at the seminar and we learned a lot regarding the program we got the opportunity to to meet with the CEO of the program everything was cleared we are really thankful
28/2/24, 4:14 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Tendai,

I hope you are having a lovely day. Thank you for sharing your experience at the seminar with me. I am so glad to hear that you had a pleasant time. We definitely look forward to hosting more such events in the future!
28/2/24, 4:15 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: During our previous discussions about the Financial Secure Plan, we were discussing how the plan will cover the first-year fees for your higher education in India by saving $3000 over a period of 20 months before your arrival, highlighting the feasibility of extending the same approach for subsequent years to ensure financial ease throughout the educational journey. May I know if you were able to follow through with all the details?
28/2/24, 9:37 PM - +263 77 387 0363: Yes
2/3/24, 3:11 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Tendai,

I hope you are having a pleasant Saturday afternoon. With the team focused on preparations for the Meet and Greet Seminar in Harare, it has been a few days since we have been able to connect on a regular basis. Hence, I am reaching out to schedule our next session on Monday between 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM to catch up and ensure we are back on track. Could you please let me know a convenient one-hour time slot within that window for our discussion?
3/3/24, 7:54 AM - +263 77 387 0363: 4pm to 5pm
4/3/24, 3:58 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Tendai,

I hope you are having a wonderful day. How are things on your end today?
5/3/24, 7:01 PM - +263 77 367 8482: evwrything good thank you and how are you too
7/3/24, 4:30 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Tendai,

I hope you are doing well. It has been a few days since we last connected, and it seems that you are unavailable at our scheduled time for the session that was suggested by you. Unfortunately, this has resulted in a delay in progressing with your admission process. As your admission officer, I'm a bit concerned about this, as it's crucial for us to engage in discussions to secure a scholarship seat for Tendai in a timely manner.

In such a case, could you kindly let me know if you are going to be available for our discussions at 4:00 PM over the next couple of days?
7/3/24, 4:35 PM - +263 77 367 8482: yes maam we are available ay that time
thank you
7/3/24, 4:53 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for confirming that, please. Here at Edoofa, we're brimming with energy and excitement, all thanks to the successful meet and greet sessions we hosted at the Martin Luther King Family of Schools in Harare last week.

The entire Edoofa Team returned from Zimbabwe with a wealth of learnings, experiences, and opportunities for our students. But before I delve into the details of our experiences and the opportunities that await you and your family, I want to take a moment to extend my sincere gratitude to you for being a part of the event and contributing to its success. Your support means the world to us.

Since my operational hours for the day have already concluded, let us conclude our discussion here, and we will reconnect *tomorrow at 4:00 PM* for our discussion. I will be looking forward to having a fruitful discussion tomorrow so that we can make progress with your application.

Have a blessed evening ahead!

I hope you are having a lovely day. I would like to begin by wishing a Happy International Women's Day to all the incredible women in your family and around the world! May you continue to inspire, empower, and thrive in all aspects of life.

Before we proceed with our discussion, I would like to check in on you and your family. How is everything on your end today?
