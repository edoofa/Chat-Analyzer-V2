This group will continue to assist you with your admission-related queries while you are here in India.
2/3/24, 3:04 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 2. Earn While You Learn Program *(Darlington EWYL23E1351)*: In this group, your EWYL mentor, head of the department, and head coach will be present.

This group will keep a record of the tasks and projects you undertake. You will be provided with the link to the group after the completion of the admission process session and on the dedicated date for your EWYL session, where you will be able to directly speak to your EWYL mentor. I hope you are clear about the purpose of the two groups.
2/3/24, 3:09 PM - +263 71 656 1426: Yes I have understood
2/3/24, 3:09 PM - +263 77 791 0505: Noted
2/3/24, 3:19 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to know that you are clear about the purpose of the two WhatsApp groups and it's reassuring to hear this from your end. I also had a recent conversation with your counsellor, during which he provided me with some insights into your academic background and career aspirations. I must commend you as a family, you must take great pride in your achievements and be dedicated to ensuring your access to the finest opportunities to launch your career.
2/3/24, 3:19 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Speaking of valuable opportunities, I am also curious to learn more about your counselling session with your counsellor and to understand which aspects of the Edoofa Scholarship Program have particularly impressed you thus far. Can you share this with me?
2/3/24, 3:44 PM - +263 71 656 1426: My counselling session was a  big enlightenment to me because I was equipped with essential knowledge. The Earn While You Learn Program is the first one whereby I got to know students are given projects to undertake as a way to earn scholarship credits which lead to reduction of tuition fees.I understood that hardworking students can get credits above 100USD per month. Moreso Edoofa has strong connection with big companies and brands which helps  Edoofians after completion  of their education to get placed and start their their professional journey
2/3/24, 3:55 PM - +263 71 656 1426: Mr Gurvinder was also able to  highlight a lot of career opportunities that I can partake after completion of my education which led to a better understanding of my future goals and with that I'm so grateful

4/3/24, 11:33 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: For the next couple of days, we will have sessions on a daily basis and once we cover the first three steps of the admission cycle, we will have sessions scheduled on a need basis.

4/3/24, 11:38 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. In such a case, we will schedule tomorrow’s session at this time.

This timeline is essential to ensure a smooth progression in the admission process and to meet the goal of concluding this session before Thursday, enabling us to assist you in initiating your EWYL process on time. I hope we are together with this?
4/3/24, 11:41 AM - +263 71 656 1426: Yes we are together
4/3/24, 11:50 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Moving forward in today's session, we will discuss a bit about your university admission journey. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts. I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them.

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
4/3/24, 11:53 AM - +263 71 656 1426: Yes we shall
4/3/24, 11:55 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
4/3/24, 12:00 PM - +263 71 656 1426: You can explain
4/3/24, 12:12 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
4/3/24, 12:12 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
4/3/24, 12:13 PM - +263 71 656 1426: Yes they are clear
4/3/24, 12:20 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counselling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counselling session will take about 1 hour.
4/3/24, 12:20 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
4/3/24, 12:29 PM - +263 71 656 1426: Yes I'm following
4/3/24, 12:41 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process, the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
4/3/24, 12:41 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
4/3/24, 12:42 PM - +263 71 656 1426: Yes it is
4/3/24, 12:48 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
4/3/24, 1:09 PM - +263 71 656 1426: Yes
4/3/24, 1:23 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
4/3/24, 1:23 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding during tomorrow’s session. You may take today’s time for the same. Until you are ready, shall we start with our discussion with me individually?

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
4/3/24, 1:25 PM - +263 71 656 1426: Yes you can share
4/3/24, 1:32 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>

5/3/24, 1:03 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Darlington,

I hope you are doing well today. Thank you for sharing the letter of recommendation with me. How has your day been going so far?

5/3/24, 2:16 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that. Kindly share the completed form with me once you have been able to do so. I would like to reiterate that your EWYL program is scheduled to begin on *8 March 2024 (Friday)*.
5/3/24, 2:18 PM - +263 71 656 1426: Thank you for the reminder
5/3/24, 2:18 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: You are most welcome, please. Could you kindly let me know by when you will be able to share the document with me?
5/3/24, 2:19 PM - +263 71 656 1426: Today in just few minutes
5/3/24, 2:19 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing that information. I will look forward to receiving the form from you.
5/3/24, 2:24 PM - +263 71 656 1426: <Media omitted>
5/3/24, 2:28 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the document with me. During our previous session, I had shared 4 videos containing messages from the founder's office. May I know if you were able to go through all of them and understand the intended message?
5/3/24, 2:35 PM - +263 71 656 1426: Yes I have gone through all of them
5/3/24, 2:37 PM - +263 71 656 1426: From those videos I understood that a student should be open minded and should follow instructions
5/3/24, 2:40 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This message was deleted
5/3/24, 2:40 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This message was deleted
5/3/24, 2:40 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This message was deleted
5/3/24, 2:41 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This message was deleted
5/3/24, 2:41 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. Let me share my views as well so that it will help you expand your understanding.

*Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students:* In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. 

You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent.
5/3/24, 2:41 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s vision for you:* Here our founders talk about the most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of tomorrow.
5/3/24, 2:41 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program:* Talking about the third video, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
5/3/24, 2:41 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP:* Another thing is that Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based. 

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
5/3/24, 2:42 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
5/3/24, 2:55 PM - +263 71 656 1426: Yes
5/3/24, 2:58 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by tomorrow before our session.
5/3/24, 2:59 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

5/3/24, 3:20 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Once you complete the two tasks that have been provided to you, we will have completed the second step of your university admission process. At that point, we will be prepared to move on to the third step, which involves understanding the registration process. Could you kindly confirm when you will be able to complete these tasks and reconnect with us tomorrow? This will allow us to schedule our discussion accordingly.
5/3/24, 3:29 PM - +263 71 656 1426: By tomorrow at 8 :00

5/3/24, 3:32 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is wonderful to hear. In that case, we will be concluding the conversation for now and we will reconnect tomorrow at 1:00 PM for our next session.

I hope by then you will be able to complete the tasks. If you have any queries or concerns before then, feel free to share them here in your admission group. Wish you a blessed night and please ensure to extend our regards to your family as well.
5/3/24, 3:47 PM - +263 71 656 1426: Thank you ma'am
5/3/24, 3:47 PM - +263 71 656 1426: I will do so
6/3/24, 8:43 AM - +263 71 656 1426: <Media omitted>
6/3/24, 1:06 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Darlington,

I wish you and your family a blessed evening ahead!
6/3/24, 5:14 PM - +263 77 791 0505: Thanks  a lot
7/3/24, 4:33 AM - +263 71 656 1426: (2) Zimbabwe's development is gradually increasing because there is persistent inflation which leads to elevated food prices thereby causing starvation and malnutrition. Manufacturing and mining sector growth are slow due to electricity shortage henceforth reducing its development. Moreso, it lacks access to international finance due to huge arrears resulting in slow development. Natural disasters  such as cyclone ,drought and the COVID-19 pandemic have contributed to high rate of poverty and vulnerability therefore lead to gradual development .There is also low living standards due to rapid population growth whilst there are limited resources also contribute to slow development .I can contribute to Zimbabwe's development through my career by improving the technology. Educating people on the effects of large families. Moreso, creating employment as way to attract investors
7/3/24, 4:44 AM - +263 71 656 1426: (3)There relationship between humans and their environment is complex and interdependent. The environment is made up of of living things and non-living things. Humans rely on the natural environment for their basic needs such as water, food and shelter. Moreso, humans modify the natural environment to meet their needs. They build dams for irrigation and construction of roads for transportation thereby modifying the environment. Humans also adapt to the environment. People have settled in every of corner of the world by successfully adapting the natural environment setting. The way people adapt to the natural environment depends on economic and technological abilities
7/3/24, 5:50 AM - +263 71 656 1426: (4)Places are connected through various modes of transportation such as roads, railways ,airways and digital communication. They are connected as a way to share innovations and ideas for instance China and America .Connection between places results in trade therefore resulting in extraordinary bilateral relationships for example Russia and China.In addition, they are connected as a way for tourism for example people travel from Europe using airways to visit Africa with many resort areas. Education also plays an essential role in connection between places for instance Asian countries have better education quality and they tend to offer scholarships to African countries.Moreso,places are connected because they share same similar backgrounds and heritage for example mostQ African countries which were colonised by Britain. Multi-transtional companies such as CoCa -Cola also creates connection between places because they operated in various places hence a relationship is created. Better employment opportunities and  salaries create connection between places as people tend  move from places with less employment opportunities to places with more employment opportunities for instance people move from Africa  to Europe. Places are also connected because they share same geographical boundaries for example Zimbabwe and Zambia
7/3/24, 7:14 AM - +263 71 656 1426: (5)Geographical Information Systems are tools used to store ,visualize ,analyse and interpret geographical data. It is important because it enhance business operations and marketing through providing platforms to store and analyse customer data.It helps business to make wise decisions about their operations and marketing strategies. Moreso, it improves environment management in the sense that it helps to understand the impact of human activities on the environment and make informed decisions. It is also important because it enhance emergency response and disaster management by providing information about a disaster to occur and the areas to be affected henceforth giving potential evacuation routes.It also helps in decision making by providing a platform to store and analyse large amounts of data. This data can be used to identify trends, patterns and relationships that would be difficult to see.It is also important to understand and  visualize geospatial data by providing data from demographic information to climate data.

7/3/24, 7:15 AM - +263 71 656 1426: I recorded the audio using sound recorder for the first question hope you are okay with it
7/3/24, 9:10 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Darlington,

I hope you are having a wonderful morning. Surely, it is alright please.  How are you all doing today?
7/3/24, 9:36 AM - +263 71 656 1426: We are all fine thanks
7/3/24, 9:36 AM - +263 71 656 1426: How are you ma'am
7/3/24, 9:39 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. I am doing good, thank you for asking. Your answers have been duly noted. With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey.

Before we proceed to the next stage, I'd like to assist you in getting started with your EWYL Journey. Based on your EWYL application form, you are scheduled to commence your EWYL journey on *Friday (8 March 2024)*.
7/3/24, 9:39 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: With your intention and commencement date in mind, we have already communicated this information to the EWYL team. They are prepared to initiate your EWYL program on Friday, as previously agreed upon.

To kick start the process, your dedicated EWYL Mentor has established your EWYL Group and shared the invitation link with us. Here's what you and your parents/guardian/sponsor need to do:
7/3/24, 9:39 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: https://chat.whatsapp.com/DM6BJ25dKnJ2uTpIeG6Snt

Darlington EWYL23E1351
7/3/24, 9:40 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Use the above-provided link to join your group. Once both you and your parents have joined, please send the following message to the group:

*Dear Mentor, my name is Darlington Tawananyasha Magarezano, and my EWYL group name is Darlington EWYL23E1351. I am excited to begin my EWYL Journey. As discussed with the admission team, I am committed to being available on 08/03/2024 to commence the procedures. Kindly schedule my session for the same date so that I can maximize the benefits and start on the right track.*
7/3/24, 9:41 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Once you start with the EWYL Program and are able to connect with your mentor, please update the same here as well by sending the below message -

*Hello Admission officer, I am now in touch with my EWYL Mentor. The name of my Mentor is* _________ *and he/she has scheduled my session for* ________. (mention the date)
7/3/24, 9:49 AM - +263 71 656 1426: Thank you ma'am for your help
7/3/24, 9:56 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: You are most welcome, Darlington. With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey. we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counselling on university admission*
7/3/24, 9:56 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Let us move forward with our discussion. To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is BA (Geography) and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
7/3/24, 11:43 AM - +263 71 656 1426: Yes you are correct
7/3/24, 11:46 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
7/3/24, 11:46 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
7/3/24, 11:46 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
7/3/24, 11:46 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
7/3/24, 1:09 PM - +263 71 656 1426: Yes
7/3/24, 1:12 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
7/3/24, 1:12 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $1000. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalise their registration process.
7/3/24, 1:12 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counsellor has also discussed the registration fee during your counselling sessions, correct?
7/3/24, 1:14 PM - +263 71 656 1426: Correct
7/3/24, 1:16 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
7/3/24, 2:03 PM - +263 71 656 1426: Yes
7/3/24, 2:06 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:
7/3/24, 2:06 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 1. *Tuition Fee*: $1800 per annum
2. *Food and Accommodation Fee*: $1000 per annum 

*Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum*

Registration Fee to be paid: $1000 (deadline within two weeks of issue of the offer letter, part of the university’s first-year fee and will be adjusted against the first-year cost of education $2800). I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?
7/3/24, 2:46 PM - +263 71 656 1426: Yes
7/3/24, 2:51 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $1000, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $1000 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
7/3/24, 2:51 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $1000 = $1800. This amount can be paid in two instalments of $900 each. The initial instalment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $900 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly instalments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
7/3/24, 3:23 PM - +263 71 656 1426: Thank you ma'am for sharing the information
7/3/24, 3:24 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: You are most welcome. I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
7/3/24, 3:24 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
7/3/24, 3:24 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
7/3/24, 4:42 PM - +263 71 656 1426: That is profound thank you for sharing
7/3/24, 4:43 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: You are welcome, Darlington. Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
7/3/24, 5:27 PM - +263 71 656 1426: No ma'am
8/3/24, 8:55 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Darlington,

I hope you are having a lovely morning. I would like to begin by wishing a Happy International Women's Day to all the incredible women in your family and around the world! May you continue to inspire, empower, and thrive in all aspects of life.

Before we proceed with our discussion, I would like to check in on you and your family. How is everything on your end today?
8/3/24, 9:31 AM - +263 71 656 1426: Thank you ma'am for your unconditional love...God bless
8/3/24, 9:52 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: It is my pleasure. Alright please, Now with this, we are done with step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
8/3/24, 9:52 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one.
8/3/24, 9:52 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
8/3/24, 9:53 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
8/3/24, 10:01 AM - +263 71 656 1426: Yes I'm motivated ma'am..thank you for sharing
8/3/24, 10:09 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: You are most welcome. The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
8/3/24, 10:09 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavour for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received special news for the students of the 2024 admission intake. May I know if you are excited to know the news we have for you?
8/3/24, 10:41 AM - +263 71 656 1426: Yes I am excited
8/3/24, 10:59 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am happy to see that you are excited. After speaking with thousands of students and parents who completed their admission process before you, we realised that the current economic situation in African countries makes it a bit challenging for parents to pay the full registration fee at once.
8/3/24, 10:59 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: In response to the same challenge, we had a detailed discussion with the academic board and university official. As a result, we developed a solution to alleviate the financial burden of the parents specifically for the registration fee due of $500 to $1000. 

We at Edoofa are thrilled about this development, and I believe it will significantly help all of our students and their families. Are you aware of the solution?

8/3/24, 11:30 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Let me share a bit more with you. With respect to the conversation we had with the academic board and the university officials, we requested them to allow the students to make the payment of their registration fee in two parts within a span of 45 days thereby reducing the financial pressure.

Here's how it works: Consider that your registration fee is $1000. After you will receive the offer letter, the first part of the registration fees which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, i.e. $500 needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university (For most of the universities 15 days). Subsequently, the second part of $500, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
8/3/24, 11:30 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for March 29, 2024, and your registration fee stands at $1000, you'll need to make a payment of $500 on or before March 29, 2024. The remaining $500 should be paid by April 29 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
8/3/24, 11:46 AM - +263 77 791 0505: It's  clear madam
8/3/24, 11:53 AM - +263 71 656 1426: Yes I have followed ma'am..it's clear
8/3/24, 12:10 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Alright, please. With this, we can proceed to step 4 of the admission cycle, i.e., *Offer Letter from University/College*. Are you excited to initiate the process? For the current round of admissions, only 31 scholarship seats are available and hence let us begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the payment plan offered for the registration fee. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
8/3/24, 12:11 PM - +263 71 656 1426: Yes I am
8/3/24, 12:16 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am happy to hear that, dear. With this, we can proceed to step 4 of the admission cycle, i.e., Offer Letter from University/College. The universities will take three to five days to evaluate your application, after which, if they accept your application for a scholarship, they will send you a scholarship offer letter. In the offer letter, the scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee will be mentioned.
8/3/24, 12:16 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: On this note, let us conclude our conversation for today. I had a very good time interacting with you, Darlington. I will reach out to you once we get an update from the universities. Wish you a blessed day ahead, and please extend our regards to your family as well.
8/3/24, 12:33 PM - +263 71 656 1426: Thank you ma'am I'm so grateful 👏🏾
