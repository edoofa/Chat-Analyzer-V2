4/3/24, 11:32 AM - +260 770474379: I have gone through it Ms Siddhi
4/3/24, 11:36 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
4/3/24, 11:36 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
4/3/24, 11:41 AM - +260 770474379: Yes you have clarified them
4/3/24, 11:50 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counselling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counselling session will take about 1 hour.
4/3/24, 11:50 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
4/3/24, 11:57 AM - +260 770474379: Yes Ms Siddhi I am following
4/3/24, 11:59 AM - +260 770474379: Alright noted
4/3/24, 12:12 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process, the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
4/3/24, 12:12 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
4/3/24, 12:13 PM - +260 770474379: Noted
4/3/24, 12:14 PM - +260 770474379: Yes they are really clear thank you for the clarification Ms Siddhi

4/3/24, 12:22 PM - +260 770474379: Yes
4/3/24, 12:34 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
4/3/24, 12:34 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding during tomorrow’s session. You may take today’s time for the same. Until you are ready, shall we start with our discussion with me individually?

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
4/3/24, 12:35 PM - +260 770474379: Alright that is really interesting to know and helpful I have really taken note of this

5/3/24, 10:41 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. During our previous session, I had shared 4 videos containing messages from the founder's office. May I know if you were able to go through all of them and understand the intended message?
5/3/24, 10:44 AM - +260 770474379: So sorry I fell sick yesterday but i promise to go through them
5/3/24, 10:49 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. The videos hold an important message which will help you in understanding your admission process and your educational prospects in a much better way. Could you kindly let me know if you will be able to go through them right now such that we can reconnect later during the day for our discussion?
5/3/24, 2:37 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: @260770474379 may I know if we are still connected?
5/3/24, 3:05 PM - +260 770474379: Yes
5/3/24, 3:05 PM - +260 770474379: Ms Siddhi Sigh I have gone through all the videos and they are really wide and open for a student’s understanding i really appreciate these videos thank you so much
5/3/24, 3:06 PM - +260 770474379: Yes Ms Siddhi
5/3/24, 3:22 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know, Betsheba. To discuss the videos and the importance of the message shared by the founders, could you kindly share your understanding of each video with me?
5/3/24, 3:31 PM - +260 770474379: 1.Students should be teachable and open minded.
2.Edoofas vision is not just to get the students quality education and to them participate in SEELS.
3.The founders edge the students to follow instructions as to get qualified for the prestigious institutions.
4.Statement of purpose we students should be diligent in filling out the documents.
5/3/24, 3:33 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. Let me share my views as well so that it will help you expand your understanding.

*Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students:* In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. 

You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent.
5/3/24, 3:33 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s vision for you:* Here our founders talk about the most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of tomorrow.
5/3/24, 3:33 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program:* Talking about the third video, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
5/3/24, 3:33 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP:* Another thing is that Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based. 

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
5/3/24, 3:33 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of NAME’S university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in NAME’S admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
5/3/24, 3:34 PM - +260 770474379: Okay i thanks it’s noted
5/3/24, 3:35 PM - +260 770474379: Alright noted
5/3/24, 3:35 PM - +260 770474379: Yes we are on the same page
5/3/24, 3:41 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the task by tomorrow before our session.
5/3/24, 3:42 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

6/3/24, 10:31 AM - +260 770474379: Alright Ms Siddhi thank you for the clarification
6/3/24, 10:32 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey. we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counselling on university admission*.
6/3/24, 10:33 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Let us move forward with our discussion. To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is B.Sc (Cardiovascular Technology) and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
6/3/24, 10:39 AM - +260 770474379: Noted
6/3/24, 10:40 AM - +260 770474379: Yes it is very accurate
6/3/24, 11:01 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
6/3/24, 11:01 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
6/3/24, 11:01 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
6/3/24, 11:01 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
6/3/24, 11:01 AM - +260 770474379: Noted
6/3/24, 11:02 AM - +260 770474379: I have a question am I guaranteed that I will have the scholarship or maybe it is not a guarantee Ms Siddhi
6/3/24, 11:03 AM - +260 770474379: Noted
6/3/24, 11:03 AM - +260 770474379: Noted thank you
6/3/24, 11:03 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: You will have a guaranteed scholarship of at least 50%, Betsheba. Based on your application profile and your results, the university will further evaluate your application and decide the final quantum of your scholarship. I hope this helps with your query?
6/3/24, 11:04 AM - +260 770474379: Yes it is not
6/3/24, 11:27 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
6/3/24, 11:27 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $1000. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalise their registration process.
6/3/24, 11:27 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counsellor has also discussed the registration fee during your counselling sessions, correct?
6/3/24, 11:32 AM - +260 770474379: Okay thank you
6/3/24, 11:33 AM - +260 770474379: Alright noted,is it the only payment needed maybe there is more to pay
6/3/24, 11:34 AM - +260 770474379: Yes it is correct
6/3/24, 11:43 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: The registration fee will be adjusted against your first year of education and your remaining balance for the first year will be due after the payment of your registration fees. I will help you gain more clarity on the same in our discussion.
6/3/24, 11:43 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
6/3/24, 11:53 AM - +260 770474379: Alright
6/3/24, 11:54 AM - +260 770474379: Yes we are
6/3/24, 11:55 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:
6/3/24, 11:55 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: 1. *Tuition Fee*: $1800 per annum
2. *Food and Accommodation Fee*: $1000 per annum 

*Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum*

Registration Fee to be paid: $1000 (deadline within two weeks of issue of the offer letter, part of the university’s first-year fee and will be adjusted against the first-year cost of education $2800). I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?
6/3/24, 11:56 AM - +260 770474379: Yes I have taken note
6/3/24, 12:00 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $1000, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $1000 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
6/3/24, 12:00 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $1000 = $1800. This amount can be paid in two instalments of $900 each. The initial instalment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $900 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly instalments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
6/3/24, 12:00 PM - +260 770474379: Okay noted
6/3/24, 12:01 PM - +260 770474379: Okay noted
6/3/24, 12:01 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
6/3/24, 12:01 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
6/3/24, 12:01 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
6/3/24, 12:08 PM - +260 770474379: Alright
6/3/24, 12:08 PM - +260 770474379: Noted
6/3/24, 12:09 PM - +260 770474379: Noted
6/3/24, 12:16 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
6/3/24, 12:17 PM - +260 770474379: No i do not have
6/3/24, 12:17 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Alright please, Now with this, we are done with step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
6/3/24, 12:17 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one.
6/3/24, 12:18 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.

6/3/24, 12:24 PM - +260 770474379: Noted
6/3/24, 12:24 PM - +260 770474379: Thank you so much
6/3/24, 12:25 PM - +260 770474379: Thank you
6/3/24, 12:37 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
6/3/24, 12:37 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavour for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received special news for the students of the 2024 admission intake. May I know if you are excited to know the news we have for you?
6/3/24, 2:04 PM - +260 770474379: Noted
6/3/24, 2:04 PM - +260 770474379: Yes I am very excited and waiting to know
6/3/24, 2:19 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am happy to see that you are excited. After speaking with thousands of students and parents who completed their admission process before you, we realised that the current economic situation in African countries makes it a bit challenging for parents to pay the full registration fee at once.
6/3/24, 2:19 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: In response to the same challenge, we had a detailed discussion with the academic board and university official. As a result, we developed a solution to alleviate the financial burden of the parents specifically for the registration fee due of $500 to $1000. 

We at Edoofa are thrilled about this development, and I believe it will significantly help all of our students and their families. Are you aware of the solution?
6/3/24, 2:21 PM - +260 770474379: Yes it is
6/3/24, 2:21 PM - +260 770474379: Not really
6/3/24, 2:24 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is alright, let me share the same. With respect to the conversation we had with the academic board and the university officials, we requested them to allow the students to make the payment of their registration fee in two parts within a span of 45 days thereby reducing the financial pressure.

Here's how it works: Consider that your registration fee is $1000. After you will receive the offer letter, the first part of the registration fees which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, i.e. $500 needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university (For most of the universities 15 days). Subsequently, the second part of $500, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
6/3/24, 2:24 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for March 29, 2024, and your registration fee stands at $1000, you'll need to make a payment of $500 on or before January 25, 2024. The remaining $500 should be paid by April 29 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
6/3/24, 2:36 PM - +260 770474379: Yes I have followed the details
6/3/24, 2:40 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Before we move forward, could you kindly share your A-Level and O-Level results with me?
6/3/24, 2:45 PM - +260 770474379: I have a question the school I was is far from home in another province, Is it possible I add the careers teacher from my school so that he can send you everything Ms Siddhi
6/3/24, 2:52 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: May I know if you can connect with him on your personal window and collect the documents from him? Once that is done, you can share the same here on the group.
