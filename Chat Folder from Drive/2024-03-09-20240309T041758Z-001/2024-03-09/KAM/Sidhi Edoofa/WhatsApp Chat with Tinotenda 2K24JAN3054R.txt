I the mother will be taking my sick mother for check up.And the father will be at a church conference which is starting today.I thought some of the reasons will be private and confidential, the reason why I didn't share them here,I thought you would just trust us and take the excuse as genuine
16/2/24, 12:12 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand, ma'am. I never doubted the genuineness of your reasons for being unavailable; I simply sought clarity on why you wouldn't be able to attend the event, since  attending the event will give you the opportunity to clarify any queries that you might have and get a better understanding of the educational journey that lies ahead of you; and I would not want you to miss it for your own benefit. If you had expressed a desire to keep your reasons private, I would have respected that completely. I apologize if my inquiry made you feel uncomfortable.
16/2/24, 12:43 PM - +263 77 336 0264: No need for an appology Ms Siddhi,I haven't been offended at all.

27/2/24, 5:39 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: As Tinotenda's parent, you have the authority to fill out the form and initiate the EWYL process on his behalf. Once you've joined the group, please inform your designated EWYL mentor about Tinotenda's availability, and they will schedule the sessions accordingly. Timely commencement of the EWYL program is crucial to ensure a smooth admission process. I hope we are together in this?
27/2/24, 5:43 PM - +263 77 336 0264: I have a very tight schedule and I don't think I will be able to do this for Tinotenda,why can't we just wait for him to do the projects on his own because honestly I won't be able to balance between work and the programs, it will be too hectic for me
27/2/24, 5:45 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: The EWYL program is designed for Tinotenda's participation. By initiation of the program, I mean completing the initial formalities of joining the group and adding Tinotenda to it. Once you've joined the group, you can inform your EWYL mentor about Tinotenda's availability starting from April, and they will schedule the sessions accordingly to ensure Tinotenda's participation. Does this clarify things, ma'am?
27/2/24, 5:48 PM - +263 77 336 0264: Yes you have clarified,so which dates should I fill on the Program Pledge
27/2/24, 5:50 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: As mentioned in the message above, your EWYL is scheduled to begin on 1 March 2024. Kindly fill the same date on the form as well.

28/2/24, 2:33 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. I am doing fine please, thank you for asking. I have successfully received the EWYL form from your end and we are ready to move forward with our discussion. Moving forward, I would like to bring an important aspect to your attention. The collective aim that we have for the student strongly values balanced involvement from parents, especially when the student is unable to participate. Your proactive engagement holds significant weight, and if, for any reason, either you or your guardians won't be available, we kindly request you to inform us beforehand so that we can plan and schedule our discussion beforehand. I hope you have taken note of this as well?
28/2/24, 2:42 PM - +263 77 336 0264: Noted
28/2/24, 3:06 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Right, now moving forward, let me brief you that your admissions process and your EWYL program will operate concurrently in the future, therefore you will have two WhatsApp groups to connect with the team: <This message was edited>
28/2/24, 3:06 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 1. The admissions group *(Tinotenda 2K24JAN3054R)*  will be the platform where we, as your admission officers, will be communicating with you. This group is dedicated to all-important discussions like your university admission process, offer letter discussion, and ultimately your university registration and reservation of your scholarship along with the Visa process. This group will continue to assist you with your admission-related queries while you are here in India.
28/2/24, 3:06 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 2. Earn While You Learn Program *(Tinotenda EWYL23E1293)* . In this group, your EWYL mentor, head of the department, and head coach will be present. With this group, we will make sure you are prepared to self-finance your education here in India. With your dedicated efforts in the EWYL program, you will earn maximum scholarship credits.

This group will keep a record of the tasks and projects you undertake. You will be provided with the link to the group after the completion of the admission process session and on the dedicated date for your EWYL session, where you will be able to directly speak to your EWYL mentor. I hope you are clear about the purpose of the two groups.
28/2/24, 4:18 PM - +263 77 336 0264: Very clear indeed
28/2/24, 4:33 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. Moving forward in today's session, we will discuss a bit about your university admission journey. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts. I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them.

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
28/2/24, 4:39 PM - +263 77 336 0264: Yes I am ready
28/2/24, 4:45 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
28/2/24, 4:48 PM - +263 77 336 0264: I am through
28/2/24, 5:09 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
28/2/24, 5:09 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
28/2/24, 5:12 PM - +263 77 336 0264: Very clear indeed
28/2/24, 5:20 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps -

*Step 3: Introduction to the Financial Secure Plan* - Parents with children embarking on their university journey within the next one to two years face important decision-making and rigorous financial planning. Edoofa recognizes the significance of this transition and hence has introduced the Edoofa Secure Plan - a unique and systematic strategy to empower parents in financial planning and preparing for their child's tertiary education well in advance.
28/2/24, 5:20 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Scholarship Offer Letter from the university would be issued next year in the month of August.

I hope you are following?
28/2/24, 5:30 PM - +263 77 336 0264: Am following very well
28/2/24, 5:31 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. The registration fee will be paid through the savings you have accumulated visa the Financial Secure Plan. After the registration fee is paid, for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
28/2/24, 5:31 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
28/2/24, 5:32 PM - +263 77 336 0264: Very clear
28/2/24, 6:09 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through all 6 steps, we will discuss the first step of the journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office* during our session tomorrow. Let us conclude our conversation here, and we will reconnect tomorrow to proceed with our discussion.

Have a blessed night! <This message was edited>

Hence, I am reaching out to schedule our next session on Monday between 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM to catch up and ensure we are back on track. Could you please let me know a convenient one-hour time slot within that window for our discussion?
2/3/24, 1:20 PM - +263 77 336 0264: Good afternoon Ms Siddhi,we are all fine.Hope you are having a good time too.Schedule us between 1.30pm and 2.00pm for our Monday session

4/3/24, 1:39 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. I am doing fine, please. Thank you for asking. During our previous session, we were about to discuss the founder's message. If you are ready, shall we proceed with our discussion?
4/3/24, 1:40 PM - +263 77 336 0264: Sure please
4/3/24, 1:50 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
4/3/24, 1:50 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding during tomorrow’s session. You may take today’s time for the same. Until you are ready, shall we start with our discussion with me individually?

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
4/3/24, 1:54 PM - +263 77 336 0264: Am ready you can proceed

4/3/24, 2:02 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection. 

Please go through the 4 videos, our next session will be scheduled for tomorrow after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarise your understanding. Hence I would like to know by when do you think you will be able to go through these videos so that we can schedule our next session accordingly for tomorrow?
4/3/24, 2:07 PM - +263 77 336 0264: The problem is I don't have Wifi facility so I have to find some data of which it is too expensive, isn't there another option or is it possible to just open those videos with a few Mega bytes
4/3/24, 2:08 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. In such a case, may I know if sharing the audio version of these videos will be more feasible for you?
4/3/24, 2:09 PM - +263 77 336 0264: Yes that will be better
4/3/24, 2:15 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. Allow me some time to share the audio files with you.
4/3/24, 2:16 PM - +263 77 336 0264: Okay
4/3/24, 2:18 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>

4/3/24, 2:52 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is wonderful to hear. In that case, we will be concluding the conversation for now and we will reconnect tomorrow at 1:30 PM for our next session. 

I hope by then you will be able to go through the videos. If you have any queries or concerns before then, feel free to share them here in your admission group. Wish you a blessed rest of the day and please ensure to extend our regards to your family as well.
4/3/24, 2:53 PM - +263 77 336 0264: Thank you
5/3/24, 10:33 AM - +263 77 336 0264: Good morning Ms Siddhi, hope you are fine.I tried to go over the audios but honestly speaking,I did not get anything, the audios were not audible enough plus am not used to the speed and tone so I did not get anything 😭😭😭
5/3/24, 10:40 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Tinotenda,

I hope you are doing well. I understand please. In such a case, may I know if it will not be possible for any of your family members to access the video files?
5/3/24, 10:53 AM - +263 77 336 0264: Maybe Tinotenda will be able but it will be during his term break
5/3/24, 10:54 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. The videos hold an important message which will help you in understanding your admission process and your educational prospects in a much better way. In such a case, may I know if it will be suitable for you if I help you understand the message by the founders right now and you can go through the videos later when it is feasible for you?
5/3/24, 10:59 AM - +263 77 336 0264: Yes you may help me
5/3/24, 11:16 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Mr. Angad, our founder, talks about how as a new Edoofian, you're embarking on a journey that holds immense promise. In the video, he talks about some examples of Edoofa Scholarship Beneficiaries from the past three years. These are students we've met at airports and colleges, now living their dream lives in India. These students are living their dreams, and their daily smiles reflect their overall life satisfaction, not just gratitude towards Edoofa. They attend classes with confidence, knowing they're receiving a life-transforming education, and their friends congratulate them on their scholarships. Their success brings joy to everyone at Edoofa. <This message was edited>
5/3/24, 11:16 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: He then talks about his recent visit to Africa, and how he met students, dignitaries, and the Speaker of Parliament in Ghana. He gained valuable insights into the challenges students face and the education system there. We identified many high-potential students who fit Edoofa's vision - individuals we aim to empower with life-changing opportunities. We also studied successful and unsuccessful individuals within the African community to identify common factors.

We identified people who are not open minded and are not teachable and blame the circumstances and who only wish for things to happen and who themselves don’t take challenges but the cusp of its neck. And then there are certain other people, people who find success, such people are always open minded, and are willing to go the extra mile. <This message was edited>
5/3/24, 11:16 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: He goes on to share an inspiring anecdote about the legendary Steve Jobs, the visionary founder of Apple Computers. At the age of 12, Steve Jobs, intrigued by frequency calculators, reached out to the CEO of Hewlett-Packard, Mr. Bill Hewlett, for spare parts. At that time one of the biggest electronics companies was Hewlett-Packard, HP. Impressed by his resourcefulness, Mr. Hewlett not only provided guidance but also hired Steve as an intern. The key takeaway here is the power of seeking help in the right manner. By enrolling in the program, you've taken a crucial step towards your successful future, and we're here as experts to support you every step of the way. <This message was edited>
5/3/24, 11:17 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: The key takeaways from this video are:
	1) Ensure you follow instructions diligently.
	2) Maintain an open-minded approach as you embark on this journey.
5/3/24, 11:17 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: May I know if you were able to go through the above messages that explain the first video, ma'am?
5/3/24, 1:11 PM - +263 77 336 0264: Sure, and I quite understand that, thank you for the clear explanation
5/3/24, 1:19 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: In the second video, Mr. Angad talks about you - our student. He shares our vision, plans, and goals for you, along with our expectations. He starts off with a story to illustrate our purpose.

One student from Ghana registered on our platform and interacted with our career counsellor and program manager. We accepted him and offered him an enrollment letter. During the call, he shared a heartbreaking story. He paid $1000 to an agent in Ghana who promised to arrange his admission to a specific Chinese university. Regrettably, the agent continued to demand additional funds, prolonging the process and causing frustration for the student. Despite paying, there was no progress after one month, and the student's repeated inquiries went unanswered. Similarly, three months elapsed without any developments, until the agent requested an additional $300 for shipping the documents from China to Ghana, further delaying the situation. This story of the student was mind-boggling as we are in a digital era and we are sitting in and living our lives in, who need $300 to get the documents shipped at this point of time. It highlights the challenges students face in navigating higher education.
5/3/24, 1:20 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: We have been helping students for the last 3 years and there are over 1000 students from Africa who are already here in India and these are those students who followed instructions and is open minded, you know when students share their experiences and stories that Edoofa has got all of this robust systems and processes, the counselling session and the  scholarship is great because Edoofa has their relationship with over 250 schools colleges and universities all across India, and Edoofa is transparent with every process. Our vision goes beyond admission. We understand the importance of employability in today's job market. That's why we offer scholarships, affordable education, and an "Earn While You Learn" program. You've already received information about this program. Recently, some of our students including Tiriwashe got their scholarship credits and used it to waive his entire semester tuition fee!

As an Edoofian, you'll benefit from the scholarships and scholarship credits, the Earn While You Learn program, a supportive community of like-minded students, valuable skills gained through part-time opportunities and the brand value of being an Edoofian
5/3/24, 1:20 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Over the past few years, we've observed certain obstacles preventing students from achieving their goals. During my visit to Africa, a student expected a fully-funded scholarship, plane ticket, and admission with low grades. While we understand that circumstances can affect academic performance, potential is more important than past results. However, a positive attitude and willingness to follow instructions are crucial.

Many institutions value our recommendations, built on trust and following established protocols. Bypassing expert guidance or scholarship protocols can hinder your success.

We've encountered students who feel entitled to handouts due to past challenges. While empathy is important, long-term success requires understanding structure, policies, and protocols. This is true for both students and parents. We want to guide you, but ultimately, you must be open-minded, coachable, and attentive to your counsellor's guidance.
5/3/24, 1:20 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Imagine a vast ocean representing the world of opportunities: scholarships, jobs, businesses, or even making a positive impact on society. Now, imagine a cup and a tank. The cup holds a limited amount of water (success) from the ocean, while the tank can hold gallons. This represents two students with different capacities for success.

Taking complete ownership and understanding our vision is key. We want to help you grow your capacity for success from a cup to a tank.
5/3/24, 1:20 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: May I know if you were also able to go through the summary of the 2nd video that I have shared above?
5/3/24, 1:51 PM - +263 77 336 0264: Yes, I have just gone through it
5/3/24, 2:09 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that. Now in the 3rd video Mr. Angad talks about the importance of watching the videos. These videos are important because the next step for you is the step 5 of the Edoofa Cycle, which is the University Interaction and we want to make sure that you are prepared enough to interact with the prestigious universities. So the faster or the quicker you watch these videos or read this message, the quicker you will make notes, the quicker you will be prepared. Sometimes when students look at the Edoofa website, they talk to other students, they look at the student’s video testimonials, they look at the google reviews and they think to themselves that all of these students are happy, they are passing with flying colours, they are living their dreams live, and wonder how exactly is it happening, and what’s the reason behind it and this video is exactly all about that because you are able to see only the tip of the iceberg, you only able to see one percent of the reason. The real secret behind it is 10 years  of hard work that we have invested into creating these systems and platforms and this entire network has a lot of resources for you so that you can pass with flying colours and live the life of dreams.
5/3/24, 2:11 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: For your university experience, quality and ethical practices are our top priorities. We meticulously select universities based on accreditation, faculty qualifications, and the use of English as the primary language. We avoid institutions solely focused on profit and choose those with established reputations and a commitment to education. Our experience has shown that some institutions prioritise profit over student well-being. However, by choosing Edoofa, you can rest assured that you'll be placed in a reputable university that meets our strict criteria and offers the "Earn While You Learn" program to enhance your employability.
5/3/24, 2:12 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Beyond academic success, Edoofa prioritizes your employability. We've observed that successful individuals possess not only knowledge but also the right attitude and practical skills. Therefore, we've carefully selected universities that offer the "Earn While You Learn" program, giving you valuable work experience alongside your studies. This combination equips you with the necessary skills and confidence to thrive in your future career.

By choosing Edoofa, you can rest assured that you'll be placed in a reputable university that emphasizes employability through the "Earn While You Learn" program.
5/3/24, 2:12 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Kindly let me know once you are able to go through the above messages.
5/3/24, 2:33 PM - +263 77 336 0264: I am through
5/3/24, 2:36 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. In the last video, he talks about the importance of Statement of Purpose. Another thing is that Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based. 

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
5/3/24, 2:38 PM - +263 77 336 0264: Understood please
5/3/24, 2:46 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. In such a case, we are now done with discussing the videos. However, I would urge you to go through the videos if you are able to find a stable network connection. Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose. I hope you were able to follow through with this?
5/3/24, 2:51 PM - +263 77 336 0264: Sure please
5/3/24, 2:54 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move Tinotenda's application ahead and help him to write a proper statement of purpose so that he can get into the best University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on Tinotenda's application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, we would require Tinotenda's availability for approximately 30 minutes. If he is unavailable, he can provide you with his input, and you can proceed with the statement of purpose on his behalf. I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by tomorrow before our session.
5/3/24, 2:54 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in Tinotenda's admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

https://goo.gl/forms/iWss6zPuOFbnGTXK2
5/3/24, 2:54 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 2. I am sharing two documents with you. Kindly go through both documents and submit Tinotenda's responses to the course document here in the group. Make sure to share his inputs and that he has researched well before starting the task. All the best!
5/3/24, 2:54 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
5/3/24, 2:54 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
5/3/24, 2:54 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Along with these tasks, I want you to share the following documents with us as they are required for your university application preparation:

*1. A-Level Result or Letter of Recommendation or Statement of Entry (A-Level).*

*2. O-Level Results*

*3. Identity proof (International Traveling Passport or National ID or Birth Certificate)*
5/3/24, 3:02 PM - +263 77 336 0264: I don't have access to Tinotenda for me to get his input, can't this wait till term break which is just around the corner
5/3/24, 3:05 PM - +263 77 336 0264: Also for his o'level results, the certificate is still at his school,we haven't collected it as yet.And for the A'level ones he hasn't written yet neither does he have a statement of entry because they have not registered for the exams yet
5/3/24, 3:18 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. Surely, he can share these details once he is available. Regarding the O-Level results, may I know if you have access to the online portal where his results can be collected? If yes, you can share the same with us.
5/3/24, 3:18 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand that you are yet to sit for your A-Level examinations. In such a case, as a part of your application file, you will need to visit your school and secure a letter of recommendation from them. We have attached a sample document to help guide you through the process.
5/3/24, 3:18 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
5/3/24, 3:19 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Here are some key points to consider when requesting the letter from your school:

1. *Visit Your School*: Approach your school administration or the designated authority for issuing such letters.

2. *Provide Necessary Information*: Ensure that the drafted letter includes essential details such as your identity as a student of the school, *your subject combination for A Level exams*, and your intention to sit for the exams this academic year.

3. *Printing and Signing*: Request the school to print the letter on official letterhead and have it signed/stamped by the appropriate authority.

4. *Include Authority Details*: Ensure that the letter contains the details of the signing authority, including their full name, contact number, and email ID.
5/3/24, 3:19 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This letter of recommendation is a crucial document that will support your application process. The Edoofa Academic Board will use those details to reach out to your school authorities and verify the recommendation letter before adding it to your scholarship application and hence I would like to inquire by when will you be able to share the letter of recommendation and the rest of the documents with us?
5/3/24, 3:35 PM - +263 77 336 0264: I don't have access to the online portal, what I know is the platform is closed 5 days after the release of results.The only way out is to collect the certificate from the school which I don't think will be soon, maybe by May we will have collected it
5/3/24, 3:35 PM - +263 77 336 0264: Maybe in May
5/3/24, 3:38 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. In such a case, kindly share the documents with us once you have them in your possession. In that case, we will be concluding the conversation for now and we will reconnect tomorrow at 1:30 PM for our next session.
5/3/24, 3:38 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Also, as promised, now that you are a part of the Edoofa Journey, the opportunity to help you self-fund your higher education and for you to be industry-ready s here, and in light of the same, I would like to assist you in getting started with your EWYL Journey.
5/3/24, 3:38 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: With your intention and commencement date in mind, we have already communicated this information to the EWYL team. They are prepared to initiate your EWYL program on Friday, as previously agreed upon.

To kick start the process, your dedicated EWYL Mentor has established your EWYL Group and shared the invitation link with us. Here's what you and your parents/guardian/sponsor need to do:

5/3/24, 4:03 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand ma'am. Our discussion has been prolonged for today due to the fact that we were discussing the videos over the chat.

May I know if this sounds feasible for you? <This message was edited>

5/3/24, 5:19 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: The EWYL program is designed for Tinotenda's participation ma'am. For now, you are only required to join to the group and let them know that Tinotenda is going to be available in April. Your designated mentor will schedule Tinotenda's session accordingly. It is essential to begin this process right now as it will help in a smooth commencement of your admission journey. I hope you understand, ma'am?

6/3/24, 9:55 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Since you shared the message here in this group, I assumed it was mistakenly posted here instead of the intended group, so I reached out to you. Thank you for confirming that you successfully shared the message in Tinotenda's EWYL group.
6/3/24, 9:56 AM - +263 77 336 0264: <Media omitted>
6/3/24, 9:57 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know ma'am. Let us reconnect at 1:30 PM for our discussion. Until then, I wish you a blessed day ahead!
6/3/24, 9:59 AM - +263 77 336 0264: Have a blessed day too.Thank you
6/3/24, 2:20 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Tinotenda,

I hope you are having a good day. Due to an urgent work-related meeting I was unable to connect with you at 1:00 PM. May I know if you are currently available for our discussion?
6/3/24, 5:24 PM - +263 77 336 0264: Just saw your message,I became very busy as well after 2pm
7/3/24, 8:21 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Tinotenda,

I hope you are doing well. I understand please. In such a case, I will ensure from my end that we are able to connect at 1:30 PM sharp. I wish you a blessed day!
7/3/24, 9:30 AM - +263 77 336 0264: Thank you
7/3/24, 1:20 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Mrs. Mugadza,

I hope you are doing well. Before we proceed with our discussion, I would like to inquire how your day has been going so far?
7/3/24, 1:34 PM - +263 77 336 0264: Am fine, how about you
7/3/24, 1:36 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that. I am doing well, thank you for asking. Let us move forward with our discussion. To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is B.Tech (Computer Science Engineering) and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2025. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
7/3/24, 1:37 PM - +263 77 336 0264: Very correct
7/3/24, 1:41 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. Based on our experience of over 14 years and having assisted over 5000 students from different countries, we have realised that financial planning is the most important factor when a student plans for their higher education abroad.
7/3/24, 1:42 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am sure that you must be aware that 20-30% of students who are admitted into universities abroad are unable to fulfil their dream and come to India due to a lack of financial planning. The funds needed for booking flights, accommodation, and covering living expenses after arrival often become overwhelming, leading to the decision to defer their admission for a year. This, in turn, creates a gap in the child's education.
7/3/24, 1:42 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: To assist both students and parents in this regard, Edoofa Management has designed a Financial Secure Plan that aims to help you prepare for your higher educational finances without experiencing stress or last-minute rushes. I believe you must be wondering about the details of the same plan and how it helps the parents?
7/3/24, 1:47 PM - +263 77 336 0264: Furnish me with the details please
7/3/24, 1:51 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Edoofa Secure Plan is important for parents who have children joining the university for tertiary education in the next one to two years for several reasons:
7/3/24, 1:51 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 1. *Financial Preparedness:* The Edoofa Secure plan helps parents prepare financially for the costs after the Scholarship being offered so that they are not caught off guard.

2. *Reduced Financial Stress:* Having the Edoofa Secure Plan in place can significantly reduce the financial stress on you as parents when your child is about to enter university. Knowing that there is a dedicated fund for education expenses provides peace of mind.
7/3/24, 1:51 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 3. *Avoiding Debt*: Without proper savings, some parents may resort to taking out loans or accumulating credit card debt to cover their child's education costs. This Educational savings plan helps avoid the burden of debt and high-interest payments.

4. *Compound Interest:* By starting to save early and consistently contributing to the savings plan, parents can take advantage of compound interest, which can significantly increase the amount available for education expenses.
7/3/24, 1:52 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 5. *Flexibility and Control:* The Edoofa Secure savings plans allow parents to have greater control over their finances and how they allocate funds for their child's education. They can choose investment options that align with their risk tolerance and financial goals.

6. *Encouraging Responsibility*: Involving your child in the process of saving for their education teaches them financial responsibility and the value of higher education. It also motivates them to outperform in Academics.
7/3/24, 1:52 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 7. *Adapting to Unexpected Changes*: Life is full of surprises, and circumstances can change especially when there are political reforms changing each day impacting the Local Currency. Having an Edoofa Secure Plan allows parents to adapt to unexpected changes in their financial situation while still prioritizing their child's education.

8. *Peace of Mind:* Overall, having the Edoofa Secure plan provides parents with peace of mind, knowing that they are actively planning for their child's future and increasing the likelihood of providing them with a solid education.
7/3/24, 1:52 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, when you go through all the above benefits, I am sure you can see that the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan is an important financial tool for parents/students who are supposed to enter the university soon. 

It helps ensure that the financial aspect of tertiary education is well-managed, reduces stress, and allows parents to provide the best opportunities for their children without resorting to debt or financial hardship. Isn't this something you and your family also wish to have?
7/3/24, 1:58 PM - +263 77 336 0264: Yes it seems to be a good idea, but just don't know if it's feasible
7/3/24, 1:59 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand ma'am. May I know why you think it will not be feasible for you?
7/3/24, 2:01 PM - +263 77 336 0264: Just sell the idea and will see whether we will be able to commit the little earnings we get towards the savings
7/3/24, 2:02 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand ma'am. I would like to let you know that the plan is flexible and we can customize it according to your financial situation. Now that you have gone through the above points, do you want me to help you understand how the Edoofa Secure Plan works?
7/3/24, 2:04 PM - +263 77 336 0264: Yes please
7/3/24, 2:05 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, as you are aware, we are currently in March 2024, and we have a good 20 months to plan for your finances before you start your university education in 2025.
7/3/24, 2:05 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: During the counselling session, you were informed that at Edoofa, we guarantee a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship on the tuition fees. Hence, the cost of education, including food and accommodation after the scholarship, would be between $2000-$3000, and it could be even less. Not more than that.
7/3/24, 2:05 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This means that if you can save $150 per month for the next 20 months, you will be able to save $3000. This amount is more than enough for the first year of university fees, including tuition fees (if any), food, and accommodation. I hope you agree with this?
7/3/24, 2:08 PM - +263 77 336 0264: Yes I definitely agree
7/3/24, 2:10 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Right, this means that by the time you would be in India, you would have already saved the $3000 that will cover the first-year fee.
7/3/24, 2:10 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, in these next 20 months, I am sure you would also be engaged in the EWYL program, and if you secure a minimum of $1000 in 20 months, that means the fees for 1.5 years are already secured.
7/3/24, 2:10 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, for a 3-year course, if we follow the same approach for the remaining 1.5 years, the educational journey for the student and the financial journey for the parent will be easy and smooth. I believe you must be able to see this perspective?
7/3/24, 2:12 PM - +263 77 336 0264: Yes please
7/3/24, 2:15 PM - +263 77 336 0264: But hey $150 seems to much especially considering the $260 we get as salary
7/3/24, 2:24 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand ma'am. Thank you for letting me know about your situation. Once we have discussed the Financial Secure Plan in detail, we can proceed with having a discussion regarding how best we can approach the plan from your perspective. In such a case, shall I proceed with the discussion if you are available?
7/3/24, 2:26 PM - +263 77 336 0264: Proceed
7/3/24, 2:26 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. With that said, there is also another benefit, I am sure being in Zimbabwe you know how drastically the exchange rate fluctuates.
7/3/24, 2:26 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: If you are buying a dollar today, you might be spending 7000 bonds, but if you buy a dollar after a month, the rate would be different.
7/3/24, 2:26 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Also, even if you choose to buy dollars every month and save at your home, it is not safe since there is news of robbery, and mugging every day.
7/3/24, 2:26 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: In that case, you will opt to save in the Bank, but again we know that savings in the Bank require a Nostro Account which means you have to pay the bank to keep your money safe, right?
7/3/24, 2:27 PM - +263 77 336 0264: Yes
7/3/24, 2:27 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is great to hear. Considering these constraints, Edoofa Management has decided to help the parents and students prepare for the journey way ahead of time by helping them save money with Edoofa without any additional charges but rather saving additional money as well. Do you want me to explain how this has been achieved?
7/3/24, 2:29 PM - +263 77 336 0264: Yes
7/3/24, 2:29 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Program Fee (Enrollment Fee) that you were asked to pay is $350. Under the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan, a parent has to deposit a small amount of money which is $150 every month for the next 10 months.
7/3/24, 2:29 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That means, in 10 months, the money saved will be $1500. When this money is saved, Edoofa will waive off $150 from the Edoofa Program/Enrollment Fee of $350, thereby making a straight saving of $150 in 10 months.
7/3/24, 2:29 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Imagine you paying $15 every month to the Bank of Zimbabwe to keep your money safe, and here Edoofa is paying you $15 every month to keep your money safe. Now, you must be wondering, why only for 10 months and not for 20 months, right?
7/3/24, 2:31 PM - +263 77 336 0264: Explain please
7/3/24, 2:32 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: If you see the bigger picture, you will realise that the reason is quite simple. Upon the completion of the 10 instalments, the Edoofa Admissions team will initiate the Child’s Admission Process by applying early to the universities to secure their scholarship and their university seat.
7/3/24, 2:32 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Reserving seats earlier increases the chances of obtaining a maximum scholarship. A higher scholarship means lower fees, and by securing the seat, you will be entitled to pay the fees as per the old fee structure of the university, not the new one implemented in January 2025. Furthermore, when applying to the universities, you will receive an offer letter or a letter of intent detailing the fees, scholarship, and registration fees.
7/3/24, 2:32 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: As explained during the enrollment process, the registration fee is a portion of your first-year university fee, paid to reserve the seat. It ranges from $500-$1000 and is not an additional fee. 

From the $1500 you saved with Edoofa, the registration fee will be paid to the university, securing the seat. For instance, if the registration fee is $1000, Edoofa will pay $1000 from the $1500 saved in 10 months. The updated balance with Edoofa will be $500, which will be paid to the university upon your arrival in India.
7/3/24, 2:32 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This eases the financial burden on the parent, as there is no immediate payment required upon the student's arrival. The $500 saved will cover the remaining fees for the semester/year, as specified in the offer letter from the university. What are your thoughts on this?
7/3/24, 2:40 PM - +263 77 336 0264: It seems good
7/3/24, 2:41 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to see that we are together so far. With this plan for the next 10 months, I am sure you must be wondering what will happen in the next 10 months, considering you have already secured your scholarship seat with the university due to your hard work in the first 10 months. Is my understanding correct?
7/3/24, 2:43 PM - +263 77 336 0264: Yes please
7/3/24, 2:50 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Let me help you with that as well. In the 11th month, you will be guided to open an FBC Mastercard bank account in Zimbabwe with a deposit of $150. The reason for this is that when you apply for your student Visa, the Embassy asks for a Bank Statement, and this account will serve that purpose.
7/3/24, 2:50 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: We understand it might be expensive if you deposit another $1500 for the remaining 10 months in FB  Bank Zimbabwe, so to avoid the same challenges, we have designed the plan accordingly. You will only be depositing for the 11th, 12th, 13th, and 14th month, which is 4 months.
7/3/24, 2:51 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Once the 4 months are completed, our Department of Student Welfare (DSW) team will assist you with your visa process. The bank statement will act as one of the required documents, and once you receive the visa, you can withdraw the amount from FBC and book the flight ticket. This will help you utilise the money as well. How does it sound?
7/3/24, 2:56 PM - +263 77 336 0264: Can't comprehend now,I think the information is now too much,am no longer getting it and am feeling as if the task ahead is so difficult
7/3/24, 3:17 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand ma'am. In such a case, I urge you to go through the information we discussed today once you are free, and if you have any queries or thoughts that you want to share, we can discuss it at our scheduled time. May I know if that is suitable for you?
7/3/24, 3:56 PM - +263 77 336 0264: Okay
7/3/24, 4:44 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that. In such a case, we will be concluding our discussion here and we will reconnect tomorrow at 1:30 PM. Now that you have all the information, I want you to take some time and discuss the financial security plan with your family members. Help them understand its importance and details. Once you're done, we can reconnect, have a discussion, and address any queries you may have. After resolving your concerns, I'll guide you through starting your financial security plan.

Wishing you a good day ahead, and please extend our regards to your family.
8/3/24, 1:28 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Tinotenda,

I hope you are having a lovely day. I would like to begin by wishing a Happy International Women's Day to all the incredible women in your family and around the world! May you continue to inspire, empower, and thrive in all aspects of life.

Before we proceed with our discussion, I would like to check in on you and your family. How is everything on your end today?
8/3/24, 2:57 PM - +263 77 336 0264: Thank you for the happy wishes, Happy women 's day to you too.
8/3/24, 2:58 PM - +263 77 336 0264: Sorry for not being available on time,I just got hooked up somewhere.Sorry for any inconveniences caused
8/3/24, 3:00 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for your wishes ma'am. It is alright please. Before reaching out to you today, I was going through pictures and videos from Edoofa's very first SLICE CON held in January, and that sparked my curiosity about whether you are familiar with what SLICE CON is or not?
8/3/24, 3:01 PM - +263 77 336 0264: I am not familiar with it
8/3/24, 3:02 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is alright, Let me tell you a bit about the same.  Recently, Edoofa hosted a conference called the Symposium of Leaders, Innovators, and Creators at Edoofa, also known as 'SLICE-CON.'
8/3/24, 3:02 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: The conference was attended by all the Edoofians of 2023 and a few senior Edoofians from previous batches. It focused on the art of creation, innovation, and, most importantly, the mindset required to make an impact in one's career.
8/3/24, 3:02 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: During this Industrial Visit and the conference - SLICE CON, Corporate leaders, such as the CEOs and Co-founders from renowned companies like Rage Coffee, Sirona Hygiene, Jolin New York, and more, shared their insights and experiences. These individuals are at the helm of multi-millionaire brands, leading large marketing teams. Their presence added immense value, providing students with the opportunity to engage in transformative conversations.
8/3/24, 3:02 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Let me share a glimpse of the conference with you and your family. I am certain that Tinotenda too would be this excited to attend such events when he comes to India.

8/3/24, 3:03 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Let me know once you are able to go through the messages about the SLICE CON, along with the images and videos shared with you. This was indeed a momentous step for all of our students, making them employable ready and giving them access to the right opportunities for their careers ahead.
8/3/24, 3:08 PM - +263 77 336 0264: Am through
8/3/24, 3:17 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that. Also, regarding the discussion we had yesterday about the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan, I wanted to follow up on our last conversation. Have you, as a family, been able to discuss it? If so, I would like to understand how the discussion went. What were their thoughts about it? Did they have any specific queries or concerns that you would like us to address?
8/3/24, 3:23 PM - +263 77 336 0264: We haven't discussed because we are not together and we couldn't do it over the phone because of network problems.But my question is,are we free as a family to just invest our money outside Edoofa plan
8/3/24, 3:40 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: The Edoofa Financial Secure Plan is an optional program designed to offer stable and consistent financial planning for our students and parents. As mentioned earlier, a considerable number of students have faced challenges in securing their scholarship seats due to inadequate financial planning and projection.
8/3/24, 3:40 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Our goal is to provide stability and reliability through the Financial Secure Plan, ensuring students avoid last-minute stress or challenges when securing their scholarship seats. We also provide benefits such as the $150 waiver and the compounding bonus to address the challenges of the Zimbabwean economy. With the Financial Secure Plan, we want to ensure that students enrolled in the plan are able to maximise their savings.
8/3/24, 3:44 PM - +263 77 336 0264: I understand but I would rather prefer to have our savings outside Edoofa
8/3/24, 3:57 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand ma'am, that is completely alright. Could you kindly share the reason behind this decision so that we are on the same page here?
8/3/24, 4:11 PM - +263 77 336 0264: It's like in the mean time we don't have any money to spare because Tinotenda and her sister are both still at school and they need fees which makes it very difficult for us to have some spare savings
8/3/24, 4:33 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is completely understandable ma'am. However, it's crucial to note that since Tinotenda's profile will be processed under early applications in August 2024, your registration fees, which range from $500 to $1000, will be due during that month. This is to ensure that we can secure a scholarship seat in the best university promptly. May I know if you have taken this into account, and have a plan in mind to save this amount within the specified timeframe?specified timeframe?
8/3/24, 4:52 PM - +263 77 336 0264: Can one secure a seat at a University before A Level results
8/3/24, 5:02 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Yes, ma'am. Based on Tinotenda's O-Level results, a verified statement of your A-Level courses (letter of recommendation or statement of entry), a statement of purpose, and an overall evaluation of your application profile, you can secure a scholarship seat as an Edoofian. Once the A-Level results are released, a re-evaluation of the application profile is conducted to ensure that the student meets the minimum requirements in the A-Level examinations. Upon re-evaluation, the student receives an acceptance letter from the university. Does this provide you with a clearer understanding of the process, ma'am? <This message was edited>
8/3/24, 5:13 PM - +263 77 336 0264: What about if the student did not perform very well at O level results but will then perform extremely well at A Level, would that not be a disadvantage if his O level results are considered first
8/3/24, 5:13 PM - +263 77 336 0264: Isn't it possible for one to wait until the A Level results are out
8/3/24, 5:24 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Based on the re-evaluation of a student's application after the A-Level results are released, the universities go through the same and re-evaluate the student's scholarship quantum as well. If a student performs much better in their A-Level examination, he/she can be offered a higher scholarship quantum as well. <This message was edited>
8/3/24, 5:31 PM - +263 77 336 0264: What about if we fail to get the money by August, wouldn't he be considered after exams
8/3/24, 5:57 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Your application will be considered later. However, early applications hold significance because scholarship seats are limited. Starting the application process in August ensures that students have a chance to secure seats before they're filled. Even if a student doesn't perform well in their A-Level exams, processing under early applications increases their chances of securing at least a 50% scholarship seat. You have taken a step in the right direction by enrolling Tinotenda into Edoofa, and we will help you to ensure that you are able to gather the required finances.
