28/12/23, 8:26 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. I did go through your responses and I can see you did understand all the videos. 

*Video 1: Important Message for Enrolled Students*

The first video underscores the importance of two crucial qualities: open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions. Edoofa's vision for its students is to foster success in their careers, and promote responsibility, and independence. A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.
28/12/23, 8:26 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s Vision for You*

Edoofa's vision for its students is to provide them with employment opportunities and the skills necessary to become future leaders. The program places students above other candidates by investing significant time and effort into finding reputable, education-focused institutions rather than solely business-oriented ones.
28/12/23, 8:26 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

In the third video, it is highlighted that Edoofa's founders have dedicated over a decade to meticulously identifying reputable educational institutions. Students are advised to cultivate the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to excel in the job market. All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to student's career goals.
28/12/23, 8:26 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools. It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.
28/12/23, 8:26 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: In summary, these videos emphasize the significance of qualities such as open-mindedness, following instructions, and cooperation. Edoofa's vision is to empower students for successful careers and leadership roles by carefully selecting educational institutions. The SOP is a vital tool for effective communication and admission success. 

I hope you agree with all of this and were able to understand these by watching the four videos?
28/12/23, 8:28 PM - +263 78 312 4048: Yes I do understand
28/12/23, 8:30 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Brilliant, Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.
28/12/23, 8:30 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by Tomorrow 6:30 PM.
28/12/23, 8:30 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

29/12/23, 3:56 PM - +263 78 312 4048: *QUESTION 2* 

 The First Law of Thermodynamics states that energy cannot be created or destroyed. It can only change form or be transferred from one object to another. Image of ice cream cone (chemical energy) being converted to motion of kids riding bikes (kinetic energy)

2nd Law of Thermodynamics - For a spontaneous process, the entropy of the universe increases. 

3rd Law of Thermodynamics - A perfect crystal at zero Kelvin has zero entropy. 

 Some examples of thermodynamic systems are washing machines, refrigerators and air-conditioners.

Air-conditioner is a closed system that circulates refrigerant inside the system, altering the pressure of the refrigerant at different points to promote the transfer of heat. 

 Human metabolism is the conversion of food into heat transfer, work, and stored fat. Metabolism is an interesting example of the first law of thermodynamics in action.

Melting of ice cube: Ice cubes in a drink absorb heat from the drink making the drink cooler. If we forget to drink it, after some time, it again attains room temperature by absorbing the atmospheric heat. All this happens as per the first and second law of thermodynamics.
29/12/23, 3:56 PM - +263 78 312 4048: *Question 3* 
A valve is a device or natural object that regulates, directs or controls the flow of a fluid e.g liquids and gases
 by opening, closing, or partially obstructing various passageways. Valves are technically fittings, but are usually discussed as a separate category.

 Butterfly valves are used where space is limited. Unlike gate valves, butterfly valves can be used for throttling or regulating flow as well as in the full open and fully closed position. The pressure loss through a butterfly valve is small in comparison with the gate valve.


A butterfly valve  actuator controls the flow of gas or liquid by means of a disk, which turns on a diametrical axis inside a pipe or by two semicircular plates hinged on a common spindle, which permits flow in only one direction.

 Butterfly valves are a type of quarter-turn valve that feature a rotating disc element that allows, controls, and obstructs the fluid flow in a pipeline. They are valued for their compact size and simple construction and operating mechanism and for inducing a low pressure drop across the valve.

 Advantages of a Butterfly Valve The disc is lighter than a ball, and the valve requires less structural support than a ball valve of comparable diameter. Butterfly valves are very precise, which makes   little maintenance.
29/12/23, 3:56 PM - +263 78 312 4048: *Question 4* 

Heat treating (or heat treatment) is a group of industrial, thermal and metalworking processes used to alter the physical, and sometimes chemical, properties of a material. The most common application is metallurgical. Heat treatments are also used in the manufacture of many other materials, such as glass.

Heat treatment is commonly known as the process of heating metal without letting it reach its molten, or melting, stage, and then cooling the metal in a controlled way to select desired mechanical properties.

Common types of heat treating methods include annealing, hardening, quenching, and stress relieving, each of which has its own unique process to produce different results.  

 *The principle of heat treatment:* Heat treating  changes metal properties by heating the metal to a specific temperature, holding it at that temperature for a certain length of time, and then using one of several methods to control the cooling of the metal. A metal's properties are determined by the shape and alignment of its atoms.
29/12/23, 3:56 PM - +263 78 312 4048: *Question5* 

A compressor is a mechanical device that increases the pressure of a gas by reducing its volume. An air compressor is a specific type of gas compressor. Compressors are similar to pumps: both increase the pressure on a fluid and both can transport the fluid through a pipe.

There are primarily four types of compressors used in the air-conditioning industry: reciprocating, scroll, helical-rotary (or screw), and centrifugal.
Centrifugal compressors are used to power gas turbine engines used in jet aircraft, energy production, and other heavy industry applications. In a gas turbine, the centrifugal compressor transfers energy from impeller blades.

Turbines are commonly used due to high rotating speeds. Centrifugal compressors are used in pipeline booster service where high volume and low compression ratios exist. They are also used in very high flow rate gas lift service. They are not very well suited for high ratio, low-volume applications.

30/1/24, 9:07 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Christian. Thank you for letting me know of the same. In such a case, I will reconnect with you at 12:00 PM today. Have a blessed day ahead!
30/1/24, 10:41 AM - +263 78 312 4048: Ok ma'am
30/1/24, 12:03 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Derylin. I hope everything is well on your end. How are you all doing today?
30/1/24, 12:39 PM - +263 78 312 4048: We are fine ma'am how are you
30/1/24, 12:40 PM - +263 78 312 4048: It's Christian
30/1/24, 1:08 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you are all doing fine. I am doing well too, thank you for asking. Kindly excuse my mistake, since I am currently in conversation with a lot of students for their admission process.
30/1/24, 1:08 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Let us move forward with our discussion. To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is B.Tech (Mechanical Engineering) and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2025. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
30/1/24, 1:09 PM - +263 78 312 4048: Ok ma'am
30/1/24, 1:10 PM - +263 78 312 4048: yes that's is exactly what I want
30/1/24, 1:48 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. Based on our experience of over 14 years and having assisted over 5000 students from different countries, we have realized that financial planning is the most important factor when a student plans for their higher education abroad.
30/1/24, 1:48 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am sure that you must be aware that 20-30% of students who are admitted into universities abroad are unable to fulfill their dream and come to India due to a lack of financial planning. The funds needed for booking flights, accommodation, and covering living expenses after arrival often become overwhelming, leading to the decision to defer their admission for a year. This, in turn, creates a gap in the child's education.
30/1/24, 1:48 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: To assist both students and parents in this regard, Edoofa Management has designed a Financial Secure Plan that aims to help you prepare for your higher educational finances without experiencing stress or last-minute rushes. I believe you must be wondering about the details of the same plan and how it helps the parents?
30/1/24, 1:58 PM - +263 78 312 4048: Yes I am aware
30/1/24, 1:59 PM - +263 78 312 4048: Ye I am
30/1/24, 2:17 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Edoofa Secure Plan is important for parents who have children joining the university for tertiary education in the next one to two years for several reasons:
30/1/24, 2:17 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 1. *Financial Preparedness:* The Edoofa Secure plan helps parents prepare financially for the costs after the Scholarship being offered so that they are not caught off guard.

2. *Reduced Financial Stress:* Having the Edoofa Secure Plan in place can significantly reduce the financial stress on you as parents when your child is about to enter university. Knowing that there is a dedicated fund for education expenses provides peace of mind.
30/1/24, 2:17 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 3. *Avoiding Debt*: Without proper savings, some parents may resort to taking out loans or accumulating credit card debt to cover their child's education costs. This Educational savings plan helps avoid the burden of debt and high-interest payments.

4. *Compound Interest:* By starting to save early and consistently contributing to the savings plan, parents can take advantage of compound interest, which can significantly increase the amount available for education expenses.
30/1/24, 2:17 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 5. *Flexibility and Control:* The Edoofa Secure savings plans allow parents to have greater control over their finances and how they allocate funds for their child's education. They can choose investment options that align with their risk tolerance and financial goals.

6. *Encouraging Responsibility*: Involving your child in the process of saving for their education teaches them financial responsibility and the value of higher education. It also motivates them to outperform in Academics.
30/1/24, 2:17 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 7. *Adapting to Unexpected Changes*: Life is full of surprises, and circumstances can change especially when there are political reforms changing each day impacting the Local Currency. Having an Edoofa Secure Plan allows parents to adapt to unexpected changes in their financial situation while still prioritizing their child's education.

8. *Peace of Mind:* Overall, having the Edoofa Secure plan provides parents with peace of mind, knowing that they are actively planning for their child's future and increasing the likelihood of providing them with a solid education.
30/1/24, 2:17 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, when you go through all the above benefits, I am sure you can see that the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan is an important financial tool for parents/students who are supposed to enter the university soon. 

It helps ensure that the financial aspect of tertiary education is well-managed, reduces stress, and allows parents to provide the best opportunities for their children without resorting to debt or financial hardship. Isn't this something you and your family also wish to have?
30/1/24, 2:20 PM - +263 78 312 4048: Yes that's all we want
30/1/24, 2:39 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through the above points, do you want me to help you understand how the Edoofa Secure Plan works?
30/1/24, 2:41 PM - +263 78 312 4048: Yea sure
30/1/24, 3:09 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, as you are aware, we are currently in January 2024, and we have a good 20 months to plan for your finances before you start your university education in 2025.
30/1/24, 3:09 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: During the counseling session, you were informed that at Edoofa, we guarantee a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship on the tuition fees. Hence, the cost of education, including food and accommodation after the scholarship, would be between $2000-$3000, and it could be even less. Not more than that.
30/1/24, 3:09 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This means that if you can save $150 per month for the next 20 months, you will be able to save $3000. This amount is more than enough for the first year of university fees, including tuition fees (if any), food, and accommodation. I hope you agree with this?
30/1/24, 6:48 PM - +263 78 312 4048: Yes we do
31/1/24, 11:55 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Christian.

I hope you are having a lovely morning. I was unable to respond to your last message as our operational hours had concluded by then. However, I am glad that we can reconnect today to move ahead with our discussion. Before we do so, I would like to check in on you and your family. How are you all doing today?
31/1/24, 1:23 PM - +263 78 312 4048: We are all fine thank you for asking
31/1/24, 1:37 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that you are all fine. During our previous interaction, we were discussing the details of the Financial Secure Plan. Moving forward in today's discussion, by the time you would be in India, you would have already saved the $3000 that will cover the first-year fee.
31/1/24, 1:37 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, in these next 20 months, I am sure you would also be engaged in the EWYL program, and if you secure a minimum of $1000 in 20 months, that means the fees for 1.5 years are already secured.
31/1/24, 1:37 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, for a 3-year course, if we follow the same approach for the remaining 1.5 years, the educational journey for the student and the financial journey for the parent will be easy and smooth. I believe you must be able to see this perspective?
31/1/24, 1:49 PM - +263 78 312 4048: yes I see
31/1/24, 1:51 PM - +263 78 312 4048: But is it a Guarantee that a student earns roughly 1000 or more while doing the EWYL
31/1/24, 2:11 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: The student will definitely be given the opportunities to earn $1000 or even more by participating in the EWYL program. It will depend on Christian and how committed he is towards making these opportunities count and earning credits through the EWYL program, as there is no upper limit to earning the Scholarship Credits. Christian can take up as many opportunities as he can and earn credits accordingly. I hope this helps with your query?
31/1/24, 2:12 PM - +263 78 312 4048: Yes I understand
31/1/24, 2:49 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. With that said, there is also another benefit, I am sure being in Zimbabwe you know how drastically the exchange rate fluctuates.
31/1/24, 2:49 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: If you are buying a dollar today, you might be spending 7000 bonds, but if you buy a dollar after a month, the rate would be different.
31/1/24, 2:49 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Also, even if you choose to buy dollars every month and save at your home, it is not safe since there is news of robbery, and mugging every day.
31/1/24, 2:50 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: In that case, you will opt to save in the Bank, but again we know that savings in the Bank require a Nostro Account which means you have to pay the bank to keep your money safe, right?
31/1/24, 4:44 PM - +263 78 312 4048: Yes that's true
31/1/24, 5:28 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is great to hear, considering these constraints, Edoofa Management has decided to help the parents and students prepare for the journey way ahead of time by helping them save money with Edoofa without any additional charges but rather saving additional money as well. Do you want me to explain how this has been achieved?
31/1/24, 6:15 PM - +263 78 312 4048: Oh yes, edoofa is offering children the EWYL PROGRAMS and as well as giving a student a minimum of 50 percent scholarship
31/1/24, 7:10 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. I was looking forward to continuing our conversation, however, my operational hours for the day have concluded, and I have had a long day already. Let us conclude our conversation for today and we will reconnect tomorrow at our scheduled time to further discuss the Financial Secure Plan. Have a blessed night!
31/1/24, 7:31 PM - +263 78 312 4048: Thank you ma'am
1/2/24, 12:36 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Christian. I hope you are all doing well today. How has your day been going so far?
1/2/24, 2:03 PM - +263 78 312 4048: everything is nice so far
1/2/24, 2:45 PM - +263 77 338 2606: We're all fine
1/2/24, 5:27 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Allow me to continue with our previous conversation - 

I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Program Fee (Enrollment Fee) that you were asked to pay is $350. From the $350, you have already paid $200, and the remaining $150 is what you are planning to pay before your due date
1/2/24, 5:27 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Under the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan, a parent has to deposit a small amount of money which is $150 every month for the next 10 months. 

That means, in 10 months, the money saved will be $1500. When this money is saved, Edoofa will waive off the remaining $150 which was due from the Edoofa Program/Enrollment Fee of $350, thereby making a straight saving of $150 in 10 months.
1/2/24, 5:27 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Imagine you paying $15 every month to the Bank of Zimbabwe to keep your money safe, and here Edoofa is paying you $15 every month to keep your money safe. Now, you must be wondering, why only for 10 months and not for 20 months, right?
1/2/24, 7:30 PM - +263 78 312 4048: Yes ma'am
2/2/24, 12:40 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Christian.

I hope you are having a wonderful day. Kindly excuse me for not being able to respond to your last message as my operational hours had already concluded. During our previous interaction, we were discussing the Financial Secure Plan. Allow me to proceed with the discussion.
2/2/24, 12:40 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: If you see the bigger picture, you will realize that the reason is quite simple. Upon the completion of the 10 installments, the Edoofa Admissions team will initiate the Child’s Admission Process by applying early to the universities to secure their scholarship and their university seat.
2/2/24, 12:40 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Reserving seats earlier increases the chances of obtaining a maximum scholarship. A higher scholarship means lower fees, and by securing the seat, you will be entitled to pay the fees as per the old fee structure of the university, not the new one implemented in January 2025. Furthermore, when applying to the universities, you will receive an offer letter or a letter of intent detailing the fees, scholarship, and registration fees.
2/2/24, 12:40 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: As explained during the enrollment process, the registration fee is a portion of your first-year university fee, paid to reserve the seat. It ranges from $500-$1000 and is not an additional fee. 

From the $1500 you saved with Edoofa, the registration fee will be paid to the university, securing the seat. For instance, if the registration fee is $1000, Edoofa will pay $1000 from the $1500 saved in 10 months. The updated balance with Edoofa will be $500, which will be paid to the university upon your arrival in India.
2/2/24, 12:40 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This eases the financial burden on the parent, as there is no immediate payment required upon the student's arrival. The $500 saved will cover the remaining fees for the semester/year, as specified in the offer letter from the university. What are your thoughts on this?
3/2/24, 11:44 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Christian. How are you all doing this fine morning?
3/2/24, 2:31 PM - +263 78 312 4048: We are fine how are you
5/2/24, 12:00 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Derylin.

I hope you all had a good weekend. I was unable to respond to your last message as our operational hours on Saturday are from 8:00 AM to 1:00 PM. However, I am glad that we can reconnect today to proceed with our discussion about the Financial Secure Plan. Before we do so, I would like to ask how is everything on your end today?
5/2/24, 7:54 PM - +263 77 338 2606: Here we're fine
5/2/24, 7:54 PM - +263 77 338 2606: How are you too
6/2/24, 11:59 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents ad Christian.

I hope you are all doing wonderful today. I was unable to respond to your last message as our operational hours are from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM. How has your day been going so far?
6/2/24, 5:31 PM - +263 77 338 2606: Good evening Ma'am.
6/2/24, 5:32 PM - +263 77 338 2606: Sometimes network is a challenge since there's also loadshedding. Sometimes phones might have run out of power due to loadshedding
6/2/24, 5:46 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please.  Thank you for letting me know that. I would like to continue with our discussion however my operational hours ended at 5:00 PM. Hence, let us conclude our conversation for today and we will reconnect at our scheduled time tomorrow to continue with our discussion.

Have a blessed evening!
6/2/24, 10:37 PM - +263 77 338 2606: Thank you so much
7/2/24, 11:31 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Christian

7/2/24, 11:31 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: And in the process of doing the same, I happened to notice that you haven't started your EWYL Program by now.

8/2/24, 11:57 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Christian.

12/2/24, 5:12 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. To continue with our discussion, with this plan for the next 10 months, I am sure you must be wondering what will happen in the next 10 months, considering you have already secured your scholarship seat with the university due to your hard work in the first 10 months. Is my understanding correct?
12/2/24, 8:02 PM - +263 78 312 4048: Yes ma'am

I hope you are all doing great. It has been a while since we last connected, and our team has had quite hectic past few days. As you already know, over the past three days, Team Edoofa has been bustling with activity – both in India and Harare for the Meet and Greet '24. I would like to share a few glimpses of the seminar with you, which demonstrates how enthusiastic and engaged our students were!

Until then, I wish you a blessed week ahead. Kindly convey my regards to your family as well. <This message was edited>

22/2/24, 5:47 PM - +263 78 312 4048: We have been doing fine
26/2/24, 10:23 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Christian,

I hope you had a wonderful weekend. Over the weekend, our team engaged in discussions regarding the Meet and Greet Seminar, reflecting on the valuable insights gained from interacting with our students. The experience was truly enriching for us, and we hope it was equally enjoyable for you as well.

Before we proceed with our discussion today, I would like to inquire how you are doing this fine morning?
26/2/24, 3:09 PM - +263 78 312 4048: Am doing well ma'am thank you for asking
27/2/24, 12:30 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Christian,

I hope you are doing well today. Kindly excuse me for not being able to respond to your last message as I was not feeling well and had to conclude my day early. However, I am pleased to let you know that I am feeling better today and eager to proceed with our discussion. Before we do so, I would like to ask how your day has been going so far?
27/2/24, 7:05 PM - +263 78 312 4048: My day was good am sorry for late replies these days my network status is weak
29/2/24, 11:33 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Christian,

I hope you are doing well today. I understand please, thank you for letting me know that. Before we proceed with our discussion today, I would like to inquire, how has your day been going so far? <This message was edited>
29/2/24, 11:49 AM - +263 78 312 4048: It's all good ma'am thank you for asking
29/2/24, 1:12 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am happy to hear that, please. During our last session, we discussed about how the Financial Secure Plan works in the first 10 months. Moving forward in today's discussion, we will talk about what happens in the next 10 months of the plan. Before we proceed with our discussion, I would like to inquire how is everything on your end?
29/2/24, 1:31 PM - +263 78 312 4048: Everything quite is fine ma'am
29/2/24, 1:40 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. In the 11th month, you will be guided to open an FBC Mastercard bank account in Zimbabwe with a deposit of $150. The reason for this is that when you apply for your student Visa, the Embassy asks for a Bank Statement, and this account will serve that purpose.
29/2/24, 1:40 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: We understand it might be expensive if you deposit another $1500 for the remaining 10 months in FB  Bank Zimbabwe, so to avoid the same challenges, we have designed the plan accordingly. You will only be depositing for the 11th, 12th, 13th, and 14th month, which is 4 months.
29/2/24, 1:40 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Once the 4 months are completed, our Department of Student Welfare (DSW) team will assist you with your visa process. The bank statement will act as one of the required documents, and once you receive the visa, you can withdraw the amount from FBC and book the flight ticket. This will help you utilize the money as well. How does it sound?
29/2/24, 7:33 PM - +263 78 312 4048: Ok ma'am
29/2/24, 7:34 PM - +263 78 312 4048: l think that's a great idea
1/3/24, 10:22 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Christian,

I hope you are having a pleasant day. I am pleased to hear that you think it is a great idea. Now that you have all the information, I want you to take some time and discuss the financial security plan with your family members. Help them understand its importance and details. Once you're done, we can reconnect, have a discussion, and address any queries you may have. After resolving your concerns, I'll guide you through starting your financial security plan. <This message was edited>
1/3/24, 10:22 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: While most people can discuss this with their family the same day, I understand everyone is different. Could you let me know when you think you'll have the discussion with your family? This way, we can schedule our next session accordingly.
1/3/24, 10:50 AM - +263 78 312 4048: Ok ma'am I will do so
1/3/24, 10:51 AM - +263 78 312 4048: Maybe during the weekend
1/3/24, 12:36 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. In such a case, would it be suitable for you if you take the time during the weekend to discuss the Financial Secure Plan with your family and we will reconnect on Monday for our next discussion?
1/3/24, 3:12 PM - +263 78 312 4048: Ok it's fine
1/3/24, 3:46 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That's perfectly fine. In that case, we will conclude today's conversation, and I will connect with you on Monday to resume our discussion. In the meantime, I hope you'll have a detailed discussion with your family and jot down any questions or thoughts you have regarding the Financial Secure plan.

Wishing you a good day ahead, and please extend our regards to your family.
2/3/24, 3:12 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Christian,

I hope you are having a pleasant Saturday afternoon. I am reaching out to schedule our next session on Monday between 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM to catch up and ensure we are back on track. Could you please let me know a convenient one-hour time slot within that window for our discussion?
2/3/24, 7:42 PM - +263 78 312 4048: From 2 to 3
4/3/24, 2:06 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Christian,

I hope you are doing well. How are things on your end today?
4/3/24, 2:22 PM - +263 78 312 4048: Everything is fine
4/3/24, 2:28 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Before reaching out to you today, I was going through pictures and videos from Edoofa's very first SLICE CON held in January, and that sparked my curiosity about whether you are familiar with what SLICE CON is or not?
4/3/24, 2:29 PM - +263 78 312 4048: No am not
4/3/24, 2:29 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is alright, Let me tell you a bit about the same.  Recently, Edoofa hosted a conference called the Symposium of Leaders, Innovators, and Creators at Edoofa, also known as 'SLICE-CON.'
4/3/24, 2:29 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: The conference was attended by all the Edoofians of 2023 and a few senior Edoofians from previous batches. It focused on the art of creation, innovation, and, most importantly, the mindset required to make an impact in one's career.
4/3/24, 2:29 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: During this Industrial Visit and the conference - SLICE CON, Corporate leaders, such as the CEOs and Co-founders from renowned companies like Rage Coffee, Sirona Hygiene, Jolin New York, and more, shared their insights and experiences. These individuals are at the helm of multi-millionaire brands, leading large marketing teams. Their presence added immense value, providing students with the opportunity to engage in transformative conversations.
4/3/24, 2:29 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Let me share a glimpse of the conference with you and your family. I am certain that you too would be this excited to attend such events when you come to India.

4/3/24, 2:30 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Let me know once you are able to go through the messages about the SLICE CON, along with the images and videos shared with you. This was indeed a momentous step for all of our students, making them employable ready and giving them access to the right opportunities for their careers ahead.
4/3/24, 2:37 PM - +263 78 312 4048: Ok  l will do so
4/3/24, 2:51 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Certainly, please. Also, regarding the discussion we had the other day about the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan, I wanted to follow up on our last conversation. Have you, as a family, been able to discuss it? If so, I would like to understand how the discussion went. What were their thoughts about it? Did they have any specific queries or concerns that you would like us to address?
4/3/24, 3:45 PM - +263 78 312 4048: No we haven't discussed yet because they are not around for now
4/3/24, 3:54 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. In such a case, could you kindly let me know when they will be available to have a discussion regarding the same, so that we can schedule our next session accordingly?
6/3/24, 2:22 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Christian,

I hope you are doing well. I was hoping to get a response from your end in the past 2 days, however, it seems we were unable to proceed with our discussion due to some reason. May I know if you are currently available for further discussion?
8/3/24, 1:56 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Christian,

I hope things are well on your end. It has been a few days since we last connected, and unfortunately, this has caused us to fall behind in Christian's admission process. I want to stress the importance of maintaining consistent communication and progress to ensure that Christian can secure a scholarship seat at a top university without any delays. Your participation and timely responses are crucial in this process. <This message was edited>
