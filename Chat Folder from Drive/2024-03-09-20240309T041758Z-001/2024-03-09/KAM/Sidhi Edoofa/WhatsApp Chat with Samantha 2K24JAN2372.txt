28/2/24, 2:38 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now moving forward, let me brief you that your admissions process and your EWYL program will operate concurrently in the future, therefore you will have two WhatsApp groups to connect with the team:
28/2/24, 2:38 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 1. The admissions group *(Samantha 2K24JAN2372)*  will be the platform where we, as your admission officers, will be communicating with you. This group is dedicated to all-important discussions like your university admission process, offer letter discussion, and ultimately your university registration and reservation of your scholarship along with the Visa process. This group will continue to assist you with your admission-related queries while you are here in India.
28/2/24, 2:38 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 2. Earn While You Learn Program *(Samantha EWYL23E1258)* . In this group, your EWYL mentor, head of the department, and head coach will be present. With this group, we will make sure you are prepared to self-finance your education here in India. With your dedicated efforts in the EWYL program, you will earn maximum scholarship credits.

This group will keep a record of the tasks and projects you undertake. You will be provided with the link to the group after the completion of the admission process session and on the dedicated date for your EWYL session, where you will be able to directly speak to your EWYL mentor. I hope you are clear about the purpose of the two groups.
28/2/24, 2:48 PM - +263 77 456 8841: Yes so the admission group will continue until l finished my degree in India
28/2/24, 3:36 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Both your admission group and your EWYL group will be active until the completion of your degree here in India. I hope you were able to follow?
28/2/24, 3:45 PM - +263 77 456 8841: Oky
28/2/24, 3:47 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Moving forward in today's session, we will discuss a bit about your university admission journey. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts. I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them.

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
28/2/24, 5:58 PM - +263 77 456 8841: Sorry for late replying my phone was shut down
29/2/24, 9:40 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Samantha,

I hope you are doing well. I understand please. Before we proceed with our discussion today, I would like to inquire how your day has been going so far?
29/2/24, 10:33 AM - +263 77 456 8841: My day is going good and yours l hope you are oky
29/2/24, 10:35 AM - +263 77 630 8755: So far the day is good though busy at work
29/2/24, 11:35 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/2/24, 12:20 PM - +263 77 630 8755: As the father of Samantha I have gone through image
29/2/24, 1:12 PM - +263 77 456 8841: I am done
29/2/24, 1:39 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
29/2/24, 1:39 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
29/2/24, 1:42 PM - +263 77 456 8841: Yes they are
29/2/24, 1:59 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps -

*Step 3: Introduction to the Financial Secure Plan* - Parents with children embarking on their university journey within the next one to two years face important decision-making and rigorous financial planning. Edoofa recognizes the significance of this transition and hence has introduced the Edoofa Secure Plan - a unique and systematic strategy to empower parents in financial planning and preparing for their child's tertiary education well in advance.
29/2/24, 1:59 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Scholarship Offer Letter from the university would be issued next year in the month of August.

I hope you are following?
29/2/24, 2:30 PM - +263 77 456 8841: Yes
29/2/24, 3:02 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. The registration fee will be paid through the savings you have accumulated visa the Financial Secure Plan. After the registration fee is paid, for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
29/2/24, 3:02 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
29/2/24, 7:29 PM - +263 77 456 8841: So the registration fee is paid at one time or you will be given a period to pay
1/3/24, 10:17 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Samantha,

I hope you are having a pleasant day. The registration fee is supposed to be paid within 15 days of receiving the offer letter. However, we do have a plan that offers more flexibility for you, and I will discuss more about it as we progress with our discussions. Now that you have gone through all 6 steps, if we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
1/3/24, 11:25 AM - +263 77 456 8841: Yes
1/3/24, 11:29 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
1/3/24, 11:29 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding. Until you are ready, shall we start with our discussion with me individually? 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
1/3/24, 11:35 AM - +263 77 456 8841: Yes please share

The third was how we interact with school, college and university why we choose them and what they can offer us 

Lastly the prepation for interactive sessions with school whereby scholarship is used in many schools
5/3/24, 12:39 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. Let me share my views as well so that it will help you expand your understanding.

*Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students:* In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. 

You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent.
5/3/24, 12:39 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s vision for you:* Here our founders talk about the most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of tomorrow.
5/3/24, 12:39 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program:* Talking about the third video, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
5/3/24, 12:39 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP:* Another thing is that Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based. 

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
5/3/24, 12:39 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose. I hope you were able to follow through with this?
5/3/24, 12:40 PM - +263 77 456 8841: Yes
5/3/24, 12:49 PM - +263 77 630 8755: Morning team I tried to go through the videos but because of bad network I couldn't finish video. What understand from the short length is a) the  instructions given to students how to enroll through  gaining experience on what happened to other students b) to know your rights as a student. c) to know the types schools or universities and accommodation which you will have then the student get to India . d) to give time to administer time find a good university for you that will give a student the  equality  high education. e) to interact the stuff of the school or University so can come out with flying colours. f) to inform students about hard work and  it's importance. I will carry on when the network improved
5/3/24, 1:00 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you sir for also sharing your understanding of the videos with me.
5/3/24, 1:00 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by tomorrow before our session.
5/3/24, 1:01 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

5/3/24, 1:33 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
