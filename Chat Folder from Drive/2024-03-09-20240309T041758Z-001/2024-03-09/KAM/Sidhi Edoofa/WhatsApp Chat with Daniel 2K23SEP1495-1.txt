How are you
12/1/24, 4:06 PM - +265 997 14 22 75: Just wanted to ask if any other university has sent an offer letter
16/1/24, 11:37 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Daniel,

I trust this message finds you well, and I hope you are in high spirits. In recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their A-Level results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey.
16/1/24, 11:37 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?
16/1/24, 11:44 AM - +265 997 14 22 75: I thought we already did this
17/1/24, 3:12 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Daniel. I believe there has been a misunderstanding. Due to some technical error, I am unable to access the required documents. Hence, I reached out to you so that you can reshare the document with me.
17/1/24, 3:14 PM - +265 997 14 22 75: Oh oky what documents
17/1/24, 3:15 PM - +265 997 14 22 75: Cause now I’ve been expecting other offer letters
17/1/24, 4:50 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Be rest assured that your application process is underway, dear. However, I was trying to access your MSCE results in our system and there was some error due to which I am unable to access it. I was wondering if you could share the same with me?
17/1/24, 4:57 PM - +265 997 14 22 75: I can just write for now since I don’t have a pic of the document 
But once I get it I’ll show you
