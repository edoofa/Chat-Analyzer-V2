Moving forward, as a part of your application file, you will need to visit your school and secure a letter of recommendation from them. We have attached a sample document to help guide you through the process.
2/3/24, 2:35 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
2/3/24, 2:35 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Here are some key points to consider when requesting the letter from your school:

1. *Visit Your School*: Approach your school administration or the designated authority for issuing such letters.

2. *Provide Necessary Information*: Ensure that the drafted letter includes essential details such as your identity as a student of the school, *your subject combination for A Level exams*, and your intention to sit for the exams this academic year.

The Edoofa Academic Board will use those details to reach out to your school authorities and verify the recommendation letter before adding it to your scholarship application and hence I would like to inquire by when will you be able to share the same document with us?

2/3/24, 2:53 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Considering this, for our future sessions, you have to decide on an hour’s time that suits your availability within this timeframe and share the same with us so that we can tailor our subsequent sessions to accommodate your schedule effectively.
2/3/24, 2:53 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: For the next couple of days, we will have sessions on a daily basis and once we cover the first three steps of the admission cycle, we will have sessions scheduled on a need basis. Hence, can you let me know at what time you would like us to schedule our sessions on a daily basis (between 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM)?
2/3/24, 2:55 PM - +263 71 358 2853: To me the set time is fine
2/3/24, 2:55 PM - +263 71 358 2853: 1 O'clock in the afternoon is good <This message was edited>

I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them.

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
4/3/24, 1:24 PM - +263 71 358 2853: Here is the recommendation letter from my former school
4/3/24, 1:24 PM - +263 71 358 2853: <Media omitted>

4/3/24, 4:12 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
4/3/24, 4:12 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
4/3/24, 4:13 PM - +263 71 296 9155: Good afternoon  l  am ok sorry  to respond  late  l was busy
4/3/24, 4:25 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. May I know if you have been able to go through the previous messages?
4/3/24, 8:25 PM - +263 71 358 2853: Yes,well noted
5/3/24, 9:47 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Bornwell,

I hope you are doing well today. We were unable to move forward with our discussion yesterday. However, I am pleased that we can reconnect today. Before we begin, I would like to inquire how has your day been going so far?
5/3/24, 9:52 AM - +263 71 358 2853: Good morning ..everything is going well so far
5/3/24, 9:54 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. During our session yesterday, we had discussed the first 2 steps in the admission cycle. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counselling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counselling session will take about 1 hour.
5/3/24, 9:54 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
5/3/24, 10:00 AM - +263 71 358 2853: Duly noted
5/3/24, 10:06 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process, the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
5/3/24, 10:06 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
5/3/24, 10:12 AM - +263 71 358 2853: Yes it is clear ma'am
5/3/24, 10:13 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
5/3/24, 10:16 AM - +263 71 358 2853: Yes please
5/3/24, 10:26 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
5/3/24, 10:26 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding during tomorrow’s session. You may take today’s time for the same. Until you are ready, shall we start with our discussion with me individually?

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
5/3/24, 10:30 AM - +263 71 358 2853: Yes l'm ready let's move on

5/3/24, 5:27 PM - +263 71 358 2853: Yes l will Thank you so much
6/3/24, 1:03 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Bornwell,

I trust you are having a pleasant morning. Before we begin today’s session, I would like to check in with you and your family. How are you all doing today?
6/3/24, 1:04 PM - +263 71 358 2853: Good afternoon ,we are well
6/3/24, 1:09 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. During our previous session, I had shared 4 videos containing messages from the founder's office. May I know if you were able to go through all of them and understand the intended message?
6/3/24, 1:10 PM - +263 71 358 2853: Yes l did go through them
6/3/24, 1:20 PM - +263 71 296 9155: We are doing  well
6/3/24, 1:54 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. To discuss the videos and the importance of the message shared by the founders, could you kindly share your understanding of each video with me?
6/3/24, 4:26 PM - +263 71 358 2853: I understand video 1 is about the importance of the scholarship credits, video 2 is about the importance of character traits of a good student compared to the rest,video 3 is about the universities that work hand in hand with Edoofa and video 4 is about the importance of the statement of purpose in securing a good scholarship
6/3/24, 4:28 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. Let me share my views as well so that it will help you expand your understanding.

*Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students:* In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. 

You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent.
6/3/24, 4:28 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s vision for you:* Here our founders talk about the most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of tomorrow.
6/3/24, 4:28 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program:* Talking about the third video, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
6/3/24, 4:28 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP:* Another thing is that Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based. 

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
6/3/24, 4:28 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
6/3/24, 4:29 PM - +263 71 358 2853: Yes we are ma'am l'm just completing reading the information above
6/3/24, 4:31 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Surely, let me know once you are able to go through all the messages so that we can move forward.
6/3/24, 4:33 PM - +263 71 358 2853: I'm done,let's move on
6/3/24, 4:36 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by tomorrow before our session.
6/3/24, 4:36 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

https://goo.gl/forms/iWss6zPuOFbnGTXK2
6/3/24, 4:36 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 2. I am sharing two documents with you. Kindly go through both documents and submit your responses to the course document here in the group by tomorrow. Make sure you research well before starting the task. All the best!
6/3/24, 4:36 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
6/3/24, 4:36 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
6/3/24, 4:40 PM - +263 71 358 2853: Thank you
6/3/24, 4:54 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Once you complete the two tasks that have been provided to you, we will have completed the second step of your university admission process. At that point, we will be prepared to move on to the third step, which involves understanding the registration process. Could you kindly confirm when you will be able to complete these tasks and reconnect with us tomorrow? This will allow us to schedule our discussion accordingly.

6/3/24, 8:34 PM - +263 71 358 2853: Question 2:Microorganisms are found in each of the three domains of life which are Archaea,Bacteria and Eukarya. Bacteria and Archaea are prokaryotes whereas Eukarya are eukaryotes. Bacteria and Archaea cells lack a nucleus whereas Eukarya cells have a nucleus. Microorganisms differ from each other not only in size but also in structure, habitat and metabolism. Some other microorganisms are unicellular and other are multicellular. There are seven top most types of microorganisms which are bacteria, archaea, protozoa, algae, fungi, viruses and multicellular animal parasites (helminths). Bacteria and viruses are quite different from each other. Bacteria live in nature whereas viruses can survive both in living and non-living conditions, bacteria can survive without a host but viruses will die without a host and bacteria reproduce through binary fission and viruses reproduce through lytic fission. Prokaryotic organisms have a nuclei and membrane bound organelles whereas eukaryotic organisms do not.
6/3/24, 10:56 PM - +263 71 358 2853: Question 3: E.coli 
Escherichia coli is a gram-negative, facultative anaerobic, rod shaped (bacilli), coli form bacterium of the genus Escherichia that is commonly found in the lower intestine of warm blooded organisms. E.coli can be found in undercooked food like mince in hamburgers and unpasteurized dairy products. It can cause pneumonia and urinary tract infections.

Cyanobacteria
It is also called blue-green algae, these are microscopic organism found naturally in all types of water. The single-celled organism live in fresh, brackish and marine water. These organisms use sunlight to make their own food.

Streptococcus
It is a genus of gram-positive coccus or spherical bacteria that belongs to the family streptococcaceae within the order lactobacillales in the phylum bacillota. Cell division in streptococci occurs along a single axis, so as they grow, they tend to form pairs or chains that may appear bent or twisted. Streptococcus causes diseases like scarlet fever and strep throat.

Salmonella
It is a genus of rod shaped gram-negative bacteria of the family enterobacteriaceae. The two known species of salmonella are salmonella enterica and salmonella bongori. The salmonella bacteria causes a disease called salmonella.

The cytoplasm of the bacteria is the one that gets  stained during the process of staining in slide preparation. The cytoplasm gets stained in this case especially the nucleic acid. The presence of an intact cell wall is important for retaining gram-positivity.
7/3/24, 1:04 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Bornwell,

7/3/24, 1:16 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that, Bornwell. In such a case, let us conclude our discussion here and we will resume it once you are able to share the rest of the answers with me.

Have a blessed day ahead!
7/3/24, 1:17 PM - +263 71 358 2853: Thank you
7/3/24, 8:37 PM - +263 71 358 2853: Question 4: stem cells
Embryonic stem cells are pluripotent stem cells derived from the inner cell mass of a blastocyst,an early-stage pre-implantation embryo. Human embryos reach the blastocyst stage 4-5 days post fertilization, at which time they consist of 50-150 cells.

Bone cells
Bone is composed of four different types of cells, which are osteoblasts, osteocytes, osteoclasts and bone lining cells. Osteoblasts, bone lining cells and osteoblasts are present on bone surfaces and are derived from local mesenchymal cells called progenitor cells.

Blood cells
Blood contains many types of cells which are white blood cells(monocytes, lymphocytes, neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils and macrophages), red blood cells(erythrocytes) and platelets. Blood circulates through the body in the arteries and veins.

Muscle cells
The muscle myocyte is a cell that has differentiated for the specialized function of contraction although cardiac, skeletal and smooth muscle cells share much common functionality, they do not all share identical features, anatomical structures or mechanism of contraction.

Nerve cells
Neurons are nerve cells that send messages all over your body to allow you to do everything from breathing to talking, eating, walking and thinking.

Sex cells
These are called reproductive cells or gametes.sperm cells are produced in men's testicles and egg cells are produced in women's ovaries. Sex cells carry human genetic information.

White blood cells are the key players in your immune system. They are made in the bone marrow and are part of the lymphatic system. White blood cells move through blood and tissue throughout your body, looking for foreign invaders(microbes) such as bacteria, viruses, parasites and fungi. Viruses like the HIV virus attack the white blood cells by getting inside them and making copies of themselves, then killing the white blood cells whilist the HIV multiplying itself.
7/3/24, 9:22 PM - +263 71 358 2853: Question 5:
Antibiotics can only treat bacterial diseases hence they are not effective against viral infections but anti viral drugs are  Although sometimes a cold can cause bacterial infection so in this case antibiotics may help. Physicians can be affected pressure-real or perceived and as a result they are more likely to prescribe antibiotics for their patients.
8/3/24, 9:59 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Bornwell,

I hope you are having a lovely day. I would like to begin by wishing a Happy International Women's Day to all the incredible women in your family and around the world! May you continue to inspire, empower, and thrive in all aspects of life.

Before we proceed with our discussion, I would like to check in on you and your family. How is everything on your end today?
8/3/24, 12:29 PM - +263 71 304 9009: We are doing well how are you? thank you
8/3/24, 12:32 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. I am doing good, thank you for asking. Thank you for sharing the answers with me. With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey. we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counselling on university admission*.
8/3/24, 12:32 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is B.Sc (Microbiology) and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
8/3/24, 12:44 PM - +263 71 358 2853: Good morning ma'am, we are doing very well and everything is good on our side
8/3/24, 12:47 PM - +263 71 358 2853: Yes it is accurate
8/3/24, 12:47 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
8/3/24, 12:47 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
8/3/24, 12:47 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
8/3/24, 12:47 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
8/3/24, 12:50 PM - +263 71 358 2853: Yes it is not, certainly
8/3/24, 12:52 PM - +263 71 358 2853: May l know the universities that have been endorsed by the Edoofa academic board
8/3/24, 1:03 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: The Edoofa Scholarship Program has worked with over 250 universities, all of which are recognized by UGC (University Grants Commission) and AICTE (All India Council for Technical Education). While it is impractical to list all these universities, let me share a few notable ones that excel in exposure, affordability, culture, and academics and the ones we will be considering for your education:

- Lovely Professional University
- Colleges under Uttarakhand Technical University
- Colleges under Punjab Technical University
- Galgotias University
- MVN University
8/3/24, 1:03 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: With the same list, the Academic Board at Edoofa will evaluate students' applications in the month of August. Based on various factors such as their A-Level Statement of Entry, O-Level Results, merit, extracurricular activities, Statement of Purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa, they will finalise a list of universities where your child's application will be shared. Subsequently, you will receive offer letters from these universities. Until then, our goal is to assist you in preparing your educational finances so that once you receive the offer letters, you can secure the scholarship seat promptly. I hope you are clear with this?
8/3/24, 1:06 PM - +263 71 358 2853: Clear ma'am
8/3/24, 1:10 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Alright please. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
8/3/24, 1:10 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $1000. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalise their registration process.
8/3/24, 1:10 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counsellor has also discussed the registration fee during your counselling sessions, correct?
8/3/24, 1:13 PM - +263 71 358 2853: Yes she did tell me about the same
8/3/24, 1:34 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
8/3/24, 2:12 PM - +263 71 358 2853: Yes we are, l was told by the councilor about the same
8/3/24, 2:33 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:
8/3/24, 2:33 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 1. *Tuition Fee*: $1800 per annum
2. *Food and Accommodation Fee*: $1000 per annum 

*Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum*

Registration Fee to be paid: $1000 (deadline within two weeks of issue of the offer letter, part of the university’s first-year fee and will be adjusted against the first-year cost of education $2800). I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?
8/3/24, 2:42 PM - +263 71 358 2853: Duly noted ma'am
8/3/24, 2:56 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $1000, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $1000 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
8/3/24, 2:56 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $1000 = $1800. This amount can be paid in two instalments of $900 each. The initial instalment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $900 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly instalments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
8/3/24, 3:09 PM - +263 71 358 2853: I understand
8/3/24, 3:18 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
8/3/24, 3:18 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
8/3/24, 3:18 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
8/3/24, 3:25 PM - +263 71 358 2853: Okay l understand ma'am but l am not yet in touch with my mentor
8/3/24, 3:56 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand Bornwell. May I know if you were able to share the message on your EWYL group that I had previously shared with you?
8/3/24, 3:56 PM - +263 71 358 2853: Yes l did share it
8/3/24, 3:59 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. It is possible that due to network issues the message was not delivered to our team. Could you kindly share a screenshot of your message so that I can verify it with the EWYL team?
8/3/24, 4:08 PM - +263 71 358 2853: Okay
8/3/24, 4:09 PM - +263 71 358 2853: <Media omitted>
8/3/24, 4:26 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the screenshot with me. I will check with the EWYL and share an update with you soon. In the meantime, let us proceed with our discussion.
8/3/24, 4:26 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
8/3/24, 4:27 PM - +263 71 358 2853: No queries
8/3/24, 4:33 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Alright please, Now with this, we are done with step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
8/3/24, 4:33 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one.
8/3/24, 4:33 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students.

8/3/24, 4:46 PM - +263 71 358 2853: I am very pleased to hear that
8/3/24, 4:46 PM - +263 71 358 2853: Thank you so much
8/3/24, 4:47 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: You are most welcome, Bornwell. The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
8/3/24, 4:47 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavour for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received special news for the students of the 2024 admission intake. May I know if you are excited to know the news we have for you?
8/3/24, 4:49 PM - +263 71 358 2853: Yes ofcourse🤩 what is it
8/3/24, 4:49 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am happy to see that you are excited. After speaking with thousands of students and parents who completed their admission process before you, we realised that the current economic situation in African countries makes it a bit challenging for parents to pay the full registration fee at once.
8/3/24, 4:49 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: In response to the same challenge, we had a detailed discussion with the academic board and university official. As a result, we developed a solution to alleviate the financial burden of the parents specifically for the registration fee due of $500 to $1000. 

We at Edoofa are thrilled about this development, and I believe it will significantly help all of our students and their families. Are you aware of the solution?
8/3/24, 4:51 PM - +263 71 358 2853: No. I only know that the registration fee will be added to my first year tuition fees thus reducing the first year tuition by whatever amount l would have paid
8/3/24, 4:54 PM - +263 71 358 2853: Is this the development you are talking about?
8/3/24, 5:00 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: No Bornwell, we have another benefit for you, let me share the same. With respect to the conversation we had with the academic board and the university officials, we requested them to allow the students to make the payment of their registration fee in two parts within a span of 45 days thereby reducing the financial pressure.

Here's how it works: Consider that your registration fee is $1000. After you will receive the offer letter, the first part of the registration fees which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, i.e. $500 needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university (For most of the universities 15 days). Subsequently, the second part of $500, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
8/3/24, 5:00 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for March 29, 2024, and your registration fee stands at $1000, you'll need to make a payment of $500 on or before March 29, 2024. The remaining $500 should be paid by April 29 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
8/3/24, 5:12 PM - +263 71 358 2853: Yes l have and thank you for sharing that with me, so far l'm gud . l will ask if l have any queries in future
8/3/24, 5:15 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: With this, we can proceed to step 4 of the admission cycle, i.e., *Offer Letter from University/College*. Are you excited to initiate the process? For the current round of admissions, only 31 scholarship seats are available and hence let us begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the payment plan offered for the registration fee. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
8/3/24, 5:24 PM - +263 71 358 2853: Yes indeed ma'am
8/3/24, 5:25 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. With this, we can proceed to step 4 of the admission cycle, i.e., Offer Letter from University/College. The universities will take three to five days to evaluate your application, after which, if they accept your application for a scholarship, they will send you a scholarship offer letter. In the offer letter, the scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee will be mentioned.
8/3/24, 5:25 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: On this note, let us conclude our conversation for today. I had a very good time interacting with you, Bornwell. I will reach out to you once we get an update from the universities. Wish you a blessed day ahead, and please extend our regards to your family as well.
8/3/24, 5:26 PM - +263 71 358 2853: So what happens if they do not accept it
8/3/24, 5:27 PM - +263 71 358 2853: Thank you so much Ms Siddhi...l will do so
8/3/24, 5:57 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Do not worry, Bornwell. We are working very hard on your application and will ensure from our end that you are able to secure a scholarship seat.
8/3/24, 6:56 PM - +263 71 358 2853: 😮‍💨gud to hear that
