04/03/24, 10:12 am - +263 77 357 4276: She tried
04/03/24, 10:16 am - Garima Edoofa: Indeed, she did her best.
04/03/24, 10:16 am - Garima Edoofa: Dear Parent and Student, we understand you have gone through the Brochures and Flyers of the Edoofa Program.
To emphasize  *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and has been rewarding meritorious students to lower their Fee Structure less than what you will end up paying at the Local Zimbabwe University
05/03/24, 8:58 am - Garima Edoofa: Good Morning @263779904462 @263773574276 @263775919899 , Hope you are doing well.

I am here to continue with our session, shall we start?
05/03/24, 9:51 am - +263 77 357 4276: I'm fine.Good morning
05/03/24, 9:54 am - Garima Edoofa: So @263779904462, as we start discussing your results further, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 


Qualification to the ESAT Exam (Please note EDOOFA calculates your results based on the TOP performers' Score so it is the percentile that we will be evaluating on)
A Level and Previous Results 
*Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 
*Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these Four  significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
05/03/24, 10:06 am - +263 77 357 4276: Yes
05/03/24, 10:26 am - Garima Edoofa: Alright so Laurrie, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.

06/03/24, 9:12 am - Garima Edoofa: Good Morning @263779904462 @263775919899 @263773574276 , Hope you are doing well.

I am here to continue with our session, shall we start?
06/03/24, 10:02 am - +263 77 357 4276: Good morning
06/03/24, 10:25 am - Garima Edoofa: Based on your previous results and evaluation of ESAT percentile, accessing your strengths and weaknesses I foresee you doing a Degree in *B.Sc. in Microbiology So now shall I brief you about *the COURSE*?
06/03/24, 10:50 am - +263 77 990 4462: Yes please
06/03/24, 10:54 am - Garima Edoofa: *B.Sc. in Microbiology* is a 3- year long, full- time course divided into 6 semesters, with each semester lasting for a period of 6 months. Microbiology has emerged as a key biological science since microorganisms provide the model used in molecular biology for research purposes.

Such research at the molecular level has provided and continues to provide answers to numerous fundamental questions in Genetics, Metabolism, Cell forms & functions. There is a growing recognition of the potential of microorganisms in a range of applied areas.

The ability of microorganisms to degrade oil in oil spills, herbicides, pesticides, and to supplement food, produce energy, besides other uses of microorganisms is becoming increasingly relevant and useful. Microbiologists study these organisms using tools, like microscopes, genetics, and culturing.

Microscopes allow scientists to magnify microbial cells that are otherwise too small to see. Genetics and Molecular Biology help scientists understand the evolutionary relationships between microbes and their habitats. Culturing is the term used to describe growing microbes, usually combined with tests to see what the microbes like to eat or what conditions they can live in. A petri dish is a common place where microbes are cultivated.

Infections from pathogenic bacteria can sometimes clear up on their own, or with help from antibiotics. Antibiotics are the various medicines that fight bacteria by damaging proteins, the cell wall, or carrying out other damaging attacks on bacteria. A flipside to antibiotics is that they can rarely tell the difference between good and bad bacteria.
06/03/24, 10:54 am - Garima Edoofa: *What is it about?*

Microbiology is a broad discipline that involves the study of the biology of bacteria, viruses, protozoa and fungi. The main focus of the course is the pathogenic potential of the organisms that cause disease in man. The course also covers aspects of the biochemistry, physiology and genetics of microorganisms.

Recently, our knowledge of how microbes function has expanded enormously, both in the disease process and at the molecular level. Genetic engineers use bacteria and viruses to clone eukaryotic genes to study and treat human genetic disorders. Vaccines are being developed for diseases such as AIDS, Legionnaire's disease and listeriosis.

In the areas of biotechnology, agriculture and food production, microbes are continually exploited for the benefit of man. Microbiologists are needed to do the research required for the future battle against diseases worldwide and to apply microbes in the production of food.
06/03/24, 10:54 am - Garima Edoofa: *Career Prospects*

Microbiologists are in demand in medical research, quality control, and the biotechnology industry. Many such graduates secure jobs as researchers working in universities, pharmaceutical and bioscience companies and institutes.

Successful graduates of the course also progress into laboratory-based careers in clinical or technical roles which do not involve research. The transferable skills one develops also equip one well for a wide range of careers outside the lab.

There are several job opportunities for those who want to pursue a career in microbiology. Microbiologists can find job opportunities in sectors such as government and private hospitals, food industries, research and development organizations, chemical industries and pharmaceutical industries.

They can also choose a career as science writer, writing articles for professional microbiologists.

*Some of the popular professional avenues open to such graduates are:*
*Bacteriologist*
A Bacteriologist is responsible for studying various kinds of bacteria, which are constantly changing and evolving. They typically perform research in a laboratory, mostly for government or pharmaceutical agencies.    

*Virologist*
A Virologist is a professional who studies the growth, development, structure and characteristics of different viruses. He isolates and makes cultures of significant viruses in a standard inhibitory medium, controlling certain factors, like, aeration, moisture, temperature, and nutrition.    

*Mycologist*    
A Mycologist is a scientist who studies fungi that is known to be an independent organism similar to animals, algae, plants and bacteria. Mycologists study operations of organism- based processes of poisonous, edible and parasitic fungi in order to discover organisms useful in medicine, industry and agriculture.    

*Cell biologist*    
Cell biologists research and study the properties, interactions and structure of cellular molecules from which they can extrapolate basic principles or generalizations about the effects of cell behaviour on an organism. For example, looking at how certain cell behaviours contribute to the progression of cancer in the body.     

*Biochemist*    
Biochemists work with the chemical composition of living organisms and perform studies of the chemical processes involved in all basic life functions. Through research, experimentation and study, these professionals provide us with much of the background knowledge on topics like genetics and heredity.
06/03/24, 10:54 am - Garima Edoofa: Please go through the course properly and understand it, inform me once it is done.
06/03/24, 11:05 am - +263 77 990 4462: Im done
06/03/24, 11:10 am - Garima Edoofa: May I know if this course aligns with you?
06/03/24, 11:12 am - +263 77 990 4462: Yes it does
06/03/24, 11:28 am - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>

06/03/24, 11:37 am - +263 77 990 4462: Yes l believe it will make things easier for my parents
06/03/24, 11:44 am - Garima Edoofa: In simple words @263779904462 what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
06/03/24, 11:45 am - Garima Edoofa: What are your thoughts on the same?
06/03/24, 11:50 am - +263 77 990 4462: It seems like a great way to encourage students to pursue their education while also gaining valuable work experience .
06/03/24, 11:59 am - Garima Edoofa: I hope it was quite evident during the Videos played during the presentations that you attended the students working on the Internships and Attachments of the much coveted EArn While You Learn Program manage to earn USD 50- USD 100 Each however since there is no limit to earning students like Persistence Muza were able to also self finance the Cost of Education though students like these are less but I am sure you are highly motivated!
06/03/24, 12:03 pm - +263 77 990 4462: Very well because from  what l analysed the students are helped to prepare themselves in their workforce and later on they are  more competitive when they graduate
06/03/24, 12:04 pm - Garima Edoofa: Yes, I appreciate it please.
06/03/24, 12:05 pm - Garima Edoofa: Alright @263779904462 , I hope you also remember Dr. Gupta discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members were available even if they were not you discussed the same with them so will they be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
06/03/24, 12:27 pm - +263 77 990 4462: Yes they are the ones who are going to support me
06/03/24, 12:41 pm - Garima Edoofa: I hope you also remember Dr. Gupta also shared about the Enrollment Fee of USD 350 that EDOOFA charges upfront, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
06/03/24, 12:41 pm - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
06/03/24, 12:44 pm - +263 77 990 4462: Yes iam
06/03/24, 12:46 pm - Garima Edoofa: So for an Edoofian the Enrollment Fee would include:

*1. Guaranteed Scholarship*
*2. Application fee of all the Edoofa’s Associated Universities*
*3. Cost of Multiple Statement of Purposes drafted*
*4. Recommendation Letter drafted for the Student*
*5. Earn While You Learn Program’s Training*
*6. Visa Assistance*

*8. Department of Student Welfare*
*9. Attachments and Internship Opportunities*
06/03/24, 12:48 pm - +263 77 990 4462: Im following
06/03/24, 12:49 pm - Garima Edoofa: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
06/03/24, 12:51 pm - +263 77 990 4462: Okay
06/03/24, 12:52 pm - Garima Edoofa: You see Edoofa's exceptional program has opened up a world of opportunities for aspiring students, garnering thousands of applications on a daily basis. The Eligibility Evaluation process ensures that deserving candidates are granted the chance to participate in the program. *Once accepted, students are requested to pay a nominal Program Fee of $350 within 7 days of receiving their acceptance letter*, following which they commence with their admission process and the esteemed Earn While You Learn Program. Edoofa's mission to provide quality education and support to students is at the heart of this initiative, and we are honored to make a difference in the lives of deserving individuals through this program.
06/03/24, 12:54 pm - Garima Edoofa: However @263779904462 , as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short period of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within the next 30 days.*
06/03/24, 12:57 pm - +263 77 990 4462: This is so kind of you
06/03/24, 12:58 pm - Garima Edoofa: I appreciate it, please.
06/03/24, 12:58 pm - Garima Edoofa: Now, let me brief you how the process follows after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.

Are you familiar with the Edoofa Cycle?
06/03/24, 12:59 pm - +263 77 990 4462: Not so well please brief me on that
06/03/24, 1:03 pm - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
06/03/24, 1:03 pm - Garima Edoofa: Let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
06/03/24, 1:04 pm - Garima Edoofa: Alright @263779904462 , as you can see, we are currently at Step 1. After this step, you will proceed to Step 2. If you successfully pass Step 2, you will receive your Acceptance Letter from the Edoofa Academic Board in Step 3. After that, as shown in the image above, the completion of your Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4.

Upon completing your formalities, in Step 5: we will initiate your Edoofa Admission Process and your Earn While You Learn Program. We will assign your complete application to our Admission Officers and the Head Coach of the Earn While You Learn Program.

The Admission Officers will be responsible for assisting you with all the required admission documentation that we discussed earlier, including the Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendation, and the completion of applications in all of Edoofa’s Associated Universities, etc.

The Head Coach will be responsible for assigning your application to the Earn While You Learn Program Mentor, who will then evaluate your candidature and assist with projects and assignments throughout your journey with the Edoofa Program.
06/03/24, 1:05 pm - Garima Edoofa: As an organization that has positively impacted the lives of tens of thousands of African students, we understand that over 97% of parents face financial challenges when planning for their child’s tertiary education. In fact, it is one of the most prominent fears because of which there are parents who despite understanding the kind of growth their child would get through international education, still opt for their children to study in their home country.

Now in our quest to overcome this challenge, I would like to inform you that in Stage 5, while our Admission officers assist with all the necessary admission-related documentation, Edoofa’s Financial Planning team will connect with your parents to help them plan finances for your higher education.

Since in the majority of African nations inflation is a real challenge, keeping in mind that the cost of living in your home country increases atleast by 20% year on year, Financial Planning officers will be responsible for helping your parents plan for your tertiary education in a way that ensures they are not burdened financially throughout your education. Financial planning would include the following aspects:-
*Budgeting for your higher education, as per your parent's affordability.*
*Supporting your parents in building your tertiary education fund.*
06/03/24, 1:05 pm - Garima Edoofa: I hope you now have an in-depth understanding of what happens in Stage 5 of your Edoofa Cycle?
06/03/24, 1:07 pm - +263 77 990 4462: Yes l have now
06/03/24, 1:08 pm - Garima Edoofa: In Step 6: Once the Financial Planning Team assists your parents in budgeting for your higher education, moving forward you will receive offer letters from the universities where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to complete the required registration process,  as well as finalizing the University. *In order to reserve your seat in any particular University chosen by you a registration fee would have to be paid which would be adjusted through your budgeting done in Stage 5 of the Edoofa Cycle.*

*NOTE:- The registration fee adjusted is not an additional cost, rather it is a part of your first year’s annual fee*
06/03/24, 1:08 pm - Garima Edoofa: *After a few weeks of your registration process, you will be given your Final Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL), which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
06/03/24, 1:09 pm - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
06/03/24, 1:09 pm - Garima Edoofa: So now would you like to ask anything?
06/03/24, 1:18 pm - +263 77 990 4462: For now l dont have anything to ask
06/03/24, 1:28 pm - Garima Edoofa: Okay so with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check and an Interaction with the Board of Directors.
06/03/24, 1:28 pm - Garima Edoofa: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
06/03/24, 1:28 pm - Garima Edoofa: Dear Laurrie,

Your scholarship journey is reaching a crucial juncture. *Thursday on “7-03-24” at 10:00 AM CAT,* I will meticulously evaluate your application. This session is not just about answering your questions; it includes a vital Eligibility Check Interview.

We strongly recommend parents/guardians join, recognizing that higher education is a family decision. Prepare for a series of interviews, marking a significant phase in finalizing your scholarship application. As your counselor, I wish you the very best. It's been a pleasure guiding you through your career sessions.

If you qualify for the interview, *Senior Career Counselor Mr Sahil would be getting in touch*, we look forward to welcoming you to India. Please be proactive, as everyone's time is valuable. The Senior Counselor and Director will make decisions based on your interview and adhere strictly to the given time. Follow instructions diligently, and if the session is completed within the allotted time, your application will proceed.

Happy Family Discussion!
Stay Blessed!

07/03/24, 9:48 am - Garima Edoofa: I really appreciate that, please.
07/03/24, 9:50 am - Garima Edoofa: Okay so in that case, I would like to ask you a few questions, but before that with immense pleasure, I would like to share the glimpses of the Africa Visit of our Founders which took place in June 2023! 

*It was a much-awaited event and they were welcomed by Ministries, Educationalists, Edoofians, and Parents across different African Countries. This is a must-watch video depicting the Acceptance of the Program in the African Continent, especially in Zimbabwe!!*
07/03/24, 9:54 am - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
07/03/24, 9:55 am - Garima Edoofa: You see, this year over 1700 students and parents attended this session, So now I would like to hear from you, as your parents are they willing to support you to the fullest so that you, can work hard and be a part of the Edoofa Program for further intake?
07/03/24, 9:55 am - Garima Edoofa: Okay so @263779904462 , can you tell me:-

1. What is the name of the course which you would be studying through the Edoofa Program?

2. Through Edoofa in which country would you be pursuing your higher education?

3. What is the average cost for studies in that country without a scholarship?

4. What is the annual fee you will pay if found eligible for the program (yearly fee after Edoofa Scholarship)?

5. What is the enrollment fee of the Edoofa Program? 

6. If you are found eligible for the program in how many days you will have to pay the first part of your enrollment fee?

7. After receiving your offer letter from the University, you will have to pay your registration fee in order to finalize your university selection and reserve your scholarship seat in a particular university, this registration fee would be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?
07/03/24, 10:17 am - +263 77 990 4462: 1 Bsc Microbiology 
2 India

07/03/24, 10:23 am - Garima Edoofa: Are your parents ready for the same?
07/03/24, 10:24 am - +263 77 990 4462: Yes they are ready
07/03/24, 10:26 am - Garima Edoofa: I would want your parents to acknowledge the same using a voice note, please.

07/03/24, 10:51 am - Garima Edoofa: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
07/03/24, 10:51 am - Garima Edoofa: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.

Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.
07/03/24, 10:51 am - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
07/03/24, 10:51 am - Garima Edoofa: Ideally as you know, the tentative dates:
1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 14th or 15th March 2024 for $200 and the 14th or 15th of April for the remaining $150.
2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 14th or 15th of March 2024. Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?

Since the results were shared over email, you are supposed to acknowledge them as well.

For your convenience, let me share the Letter of Acceptance for Laurrie over here as well so that you can go through it and let me know.
08/03/24, 10:10 am - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
08/03/24, 10:41 am - Garima Edoofa: Are we connected @263779904462 @263775919899 @263773574276
08/03/24, 10:54 am - +263 77 990 4462: Yes good morning  thank you  iam so happy and glad that l have been found eligible for the program
08/03/24, 10:55 am - Garima Edoofa: I really appreciate it, please.
08/03/24, 10:55 am - Garima Edoofa: May I know if you have gone through the Letter Of Acceptance?
08/03/24, 10:56 am - +263 77 990 4462: Yes l have gone through it and iam pleased
08/03/24, 10:56 am - Garima Edoofa: May I know if you want to ask any questions regarding the same?
08/03/24, 10:58 am - +263 77 990 4462: No everything is sitting well with me
08/03/24, 11:02 am - Garima Edoofa: Alright please, however since you must have seen, there are two modes of fee payments mentioned:-

1. Direct Bank Transfer to our Parent Company's account
2. Deposit in our associate's account over there in Zimbabwe

Which mode according to you would be convenient, so that I can brief you in-depth about that particular mode?
08/03/24, 12:52 pm - +263 77 591 9899: Method number 2 deposit in associate account
08/03/24, 12:53 pm - Garima Edoofa: @263775919899 basically you see in the first mode, the Direct Bank Transfer Mode, the transfer charges which are to be borne by the parents of the student ranges between $100 to $120 which become quite high for a lot of parents considering the economic situation in Zimbabwe itself. So as not every student is in a position to cater for an additional $100 to $120 just as transfer charge, the second mode was introduced, wherein, it is the Bank deposit in Mr. Charles's Account, in this the transfer charges get divided amongst 10 students resulting in an equivalent bearing of 12.5% at the end.

So as you can see in the letter that there is a Bank deposit in, Mr. Charles Jerera (Retired Education Officer)'s account as he is our Associated Partner there in Zimbabwe, Since 2020 there have been over 1400+ students who have been assisted by Mr Charles inorder to complete their enrollment formalities as well as university fee payments after arriving in India.
08/03/24, 12:53 pm - Garima Edoofa: Therefore the fee can also be paid through him. Since his account is a NOSTRO Account which only holds USD itself, therefore the necessary amount including the transfer charges in this mode itself would be $394 ($350 + $44 transfer charges), and the same details are as below:-

BANK NAME: FBC

SWIFT CODE: FBCPZWHA

ACC NAME: CHARLES JERERA
