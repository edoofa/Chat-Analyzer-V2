*Your results for the ESAT 2024 62 /100*

Congratulations on Sailing Through! *I request you and your parents to be active in the group so that we continue with the Counseling Session with you and your family.*
05/03/24, 8:58 am - Garima Edoofa: Good Morning @263782339757 @263719022192 @263773022192 , Hope you are doing well.

I am here to continue with our session, shall we start?
05/03/24, 9:09 am - +263 78 233 9757: Yes we can start now
05/03/24, 9:09 am - +263 78 233 9757: Good morning
05/03/24, 9:10 am - Garima Edoofa: Dear Parent and Student, we understand you have gone through the Brochures and Flyers of the Edoofa Program.
To emphasize  *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and has been rewarding meritorious students to lower their Fee Structure less than what you will end up paying at the Local Zimbabwe University
05/03/24, 9:19 am - Garima Edoofa: Okay so @263782339757 , as we start discussing your results further, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

To get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 


Qualification to the ESAT Exam (Please note EDOOFA calculates your results based on the TOP performers' Score so it is the percentile that we will be evaluating on)
A Level and Previous Results 
*Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 
*Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these Four significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
05/03/24, 9:22 am - +263 78 233 9757: Yes l am very capable

05/03/24, 2:08 pm - +263 78 233 9757: Ok

05/03/24, 2:26 pm - +263 78 233 9757: I understand it
05/03/24, 2:31 pm - Garima Edoofa: May I know if this course aligns with you?
05/03/24, 2:44 pm - +263 78 233 9757: Yes it does
05/03/24, 2:46 pm - Garima Edoofa: That's a wonderful course that you have settled for, I also have access to the Feedback form that you filled out after the session with your parents and I hope you are aware, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
05/03/24, 2:47 pm - Garima Edoofa: So, don't you think it is affordable for your family?
05/03/24, 4:27 pm - Garima Edoofa: Are we still connected?
05/03/24, 5:02 pm - +263 78 233 9757: It might be
05/03/24, 5:38 pm - Garima Edoofa: In simple words @263782339757 what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost nearly $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food, and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we allow the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
05/03/24, 5:38 pm - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
05/03/24, 5:39 pm - Garima Edoofa: However as per my experience, since you have a valid ESAT Score with decent High School Results, as per your interaction with the Board of Directors at Edoofa you surely will be rewarded with a higher quantum of scholarship after which the average annual fee for you could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, now this, and even *After this we allow the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
05/03/24, 5:39 pm - Garima Edoofa: What are your thoughts about the same?
05/03/24, 8:21 pm - +263 78 233 9757: I think it's a good thing and l can go for that
05/03/24, 8:24 pm - Garima Edoofa: I hope it was quite evident during the Videos played during the presentations that you attended the students working on the Internships and Attachments of the much coveted EArn While You Learn Program manage to earn USD 50- USD 100 Each however since there is no limit to earning students like Persistence Muza were able to also self finance the Cost of Education though students like these are less but I am sure you are highly motivated!
05/03/24, 8:25 pm - +263 78 233 9757: I am highly motivated
05/03/24, 8:27 pm - Garima Edoofa: Alright, @263782339757, I hope you also remember Dr. Gupta discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members were available even if they were not you discussed the same with them so will they be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
05/03/24, 8:28 pm - +263 78 233 9757: Yes my family would be supporting
05/03/24, 8:29 pm - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
05/03/24, 8:29 pm - Garima Edoofa: I hope you also remember Dr. Gupta also shared about the Enrollment Fee of USD 350 that EDOOFA charges up front, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students. However, for that, you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
05/03/24, 8:31 pm - +263 78 233 9757: Yes l am ready
05/03/24, 8:31 pm - Garima Edoofa: So for an Edoofian the Enrollment Fee would include:

*1. Guaranteed Scholarship*

*3. Cost of Multiple Statement of Purposes drafted*
*4. Recommendation Letter drafted for the Student*
*5. Earn While You Learn Program’s Training*

05/03/24, 8:32 pm - +263 78 233 9757: Okay you can proceed
05/03/24, 8:33 pm - Garima Edoofa: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
05/03/24, 8:35 pm - Garima Edoofa: You see Edoofa's exceptional program has opened up a world of opportunities for aspiring students, garnering thousands of applications on a daily basis. The Eligibility Evaluation process ensures that deserving candidates are granted the chance to participate in the program. *Once accepted, students are requested to pay a nominal Program Fee of $350 within 7 days of receiving their acceptance letter*, following which they commence with their admission process and the esteemed Earn While You Learn Program. Edoofa's mission to provide quality education and support to students is at the heart of this initiative, and we are honored to make a difference in the lives of deserving individuals through this program.
05/03/24, 8:38 pm - +263 78 233 9757: Thank you is there anything else
05/03/24, 8:39 pm - Garima Edoofa: However @263782339757 , we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within the next 30 days.*
05/03/24, 8:41 pm - +263 78 233 9757: I would prefer a part fee payment if possible
05/03/24, 8:41 pm - Garima Edoofa: Alright, please.
05/03/24, 8:41 pm - Garima Edoofa: Now, let me brief you on how the process follows after you are found eligible and enrolled in the Program which is Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle.

Are you familiar with the Edoofa Cycle?
05/03/24, 8:42 pm - +263 78 233 9757: No may you elaborate on that
05/03/24, 8:42 pm - Garima Edoofa: Yes, please.
05/03/24, 8:42 pm - Garima Edoofa: Let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
05/03/24, 8:42 pm - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
05/03/24, 8:43 pm - Garima Edoofa: Alright @263782339757 , so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. will be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zimbabwe itself.
05/03/24, 8:43 pm - Garima Edoofa: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
05/03/24, 8:46 pm - +263 78 233 9757: Yes l sincerely understand it
05/03/24, 8:47 pm - Garima Edoofa: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks to make the payment of the registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
05/03/24, 8:48 pm - Garima Edoofa: Basically, this registration fee will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August/September 2024 and the remaining in January next year 2025.
05/03/24, 8:48 pm - Garima Edoofa: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
05/03/24, 8:49 pm - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
05/03/24, 8:49 pm - +263 78 233 9757: That is a lot of information thank you for sparing your time with me
05/03/24, 8:49 pm - Garima Edoofa: So now would you like to ask anything?

05/03/24, 8:58 pm - Garima Edoofa: I hope it is clear now?
05/03/24, 8:58 pm - +263 78 233 9757: Yes it is clear
05/03/24, 8:58 pm - +263 78 233 9757: Again will you help me with the visa
05/03/24, 9:00 pm - Garima Edoofa: Our admissions Team will provide you with proper Visa assistance.
05/03/24, 9:00 pm - +263 78 233 9757: Thank you
05/03/24, 9:01 pm - +263 78 233 9757: When is the interview
05/03/24, 9:05 pm - Garima Edoofa: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

After receiving your offer letter from the University, you will have to pay your registration fee in order to finalize your university selection and reserve your scholarship seat in a particular university, this registration fee would be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?
06/03/24, 11:59 am - +263 78 233 9757: Yes
06/03/24, 12:01 pm - Garima Edoofa: Please answer these questions.

06/03/24, 12:14 pm - +263 78 233 9757: Yes ma'am
06/03/24, 12:15 pm - Garima Edoofa: Are your parents ready for the same?
06/03/24, 12:15 pm - +263 78 233 9757: Yes they are definitely
06/03/24, 12:15 pm - Garima Edoofa: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
06/03/24, 12:15 pm - Garima Edoofa: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.

Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.
06/03/24, 12:15 pm - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
06/03/24, 12:16 pm - Garima Edoofa: Ideally as you know, the tentative dates:
1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 13th or 14th March 2024 for $200 and the 13th or 14th of April for the remaining $150.
2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 13th or 14th of March 2024. Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?

08/03/24, 10:16 am - +263 78 233 9757: Good morning
08/03/24, 12:25 pm - Garima Edoofa: Greetings @263782339757 @263773022192 @263719022192, Hope you are doing well.
08/03/24, 12:52 pm - Garima Edoofa: Are we connected?
08/03/24, 12:54 pm - +263 78 233 9757: Yes we are
08/03/24, 12:55 pm - Garima Edoofa: May I know if you have gone through the Letter Of Acceptance?
08/03/24, 12:55 pm - +263 78 233 9757: Yes l have
08/03/24, 12:56 pm - Garima Edoofa: May I know if your parents have gone through the letter too? and if yes are there any questions that you want to ask regarding the same?
08/03/24, 12:57 pm - +263 78 233 9757: My parents went through it as well and they were happy about it
08/03/24, 12:58 pm - +263 78 233 9757: Rather l have a few questions regarding the percentage of the scholarship ranging from 60-100% l need to know the precise range
08/03/24, 1:24 pm - Garima Edoofa: I wish to inform you that the scholarship you have been awarded falls within the range of 60% to 100%. The exact percentage of the scholarship will be determined once you are enrolled in the program and your university selection is finalized. As outlined in the scholarship letter, the initial estimated cost was between $2000 and $3000. However, upon careful review, the actual cost is stated as $1600 to $2300. Once the university selection process is completed, you will receive the precise scholarship amount.
08/03/24, 1:24 pm - Garima Edoofa: however since you must have seen, there are two modes of fee payments mentioned:-

1. Direct Bank Transfer to our Parent Company's account
2. Deposit in our associate's account over there in Zimbabwe

Which mode according to you would be convenient, so that I can brief you in-depth about that particular mode?
08/03/24, 1:25 pm - +263 78 233 9757: 2
08/03/24, 1:31 pm - Garima Edoofa: @263782339757 basically you see in the first mode, the Direct Bank Transfer Mode, the transfer charges which are to be borne by the parents of the student ranges between $100 to $120 which become quite high for a lot of parents considering the economic situation in Zimbabwe itself. So as not every student is in a position to cater for an additional $100 to $120 just as transfer charge, the second mode was introduced, wherein, it is the Bank deposit in Mr. Charles's Account, in this the transfer charges get divided amongst 10 students resulting in an equivalent bearing of 12.5% at the end.

So as you can see in the letter that there is a Bank deposit in, Mr. Charles Jerera (Retired Education Officer)'s account as he is our Associated Partner there in Zimbabwe, Since 2020 there have been over 1400+ students who have been assisted by Mr Charles inorder to complete their enrollment formalities as well as university fee payments after arriving in India.
08/03/24, 1:32 pm - Garima Edoofa: Therefore the fee can also be paid through him. Since his account is a NOSTRO Account which only holds USD itself, therefore the necessary amount including the transfer charges in this mode itself would be $394 ($350 + $44 transfer charges), and the same details are as below:-

BANK NAME: FBC

SWIFT CODE: FBCPZWHA

ACC NAME: CHARLES JERERA
