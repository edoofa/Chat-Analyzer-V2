01/03/24, 3:20 pm - Garima Edoofa: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
01/03/24, 3:21 pm - +263 77 403 9248 joined using this group's invite link
01/03/24, 3:26 pm - +263 77 734 6504: Studying abroad would allow me to develop myself in other fields of my perception  about the world and understand different cultures and values of different countries and ethnicities .
I believe it could also improve my employer value through the ability to adapt to different kinds of people and races.
I am also someone who likes to travel and meet new people and make new friends.
And as a plus i would also learn a new language.
01/03/24, 3:34 pm - Garima Edoofa: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
01/03/24, 3:46 pm - +263 77 734 6504: I am concerned about the education system in my country ,after this program i aim to make a group of people with the similar experience and go into schools teaching the young generation and also the educators on different ways we can improve the learning environment for the young generation and different teaching methods that can be used to unleash the full potential in a student.
Since i would have been in a different learning environment i can identify areas that need to be improved in the field of education
01/03/24, 3:49 pm - Garima Edoofa: I appreciate your sense of hard work for your community Tanaka but to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?
01/03/24, 3:50 pm - +263 77 734 6504: I agree ,,,100%
01/03/24, 3:51 pm - Garima Edoofa: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
01/03/24, 3:53 pm - +263 77 734 6504: Yes,I has gone through my mind that we share a similar history but honestly i like how the indian culture has been preserved throughout the time.

God bless you too
02/03/24, 9:37 am - +263 77 734 6504: Good morning
02/03/24, 9:40 am - Garima Edoofa: Good Morning @263777346504 @263772974333 @263774039248 , Hope you are doing well.

I am here to continue with our session, shall we start?
02/03/24, 9:40 am - +263 77 734 6504: Yes
02/03/24, 9:48 am - Garima Edoofa: That is remarkable,@263777346504 . I see that you understand the quality of higher education that Edoofa seeks to deliver to its students so that after completing their education, the students are capable of achieving their career goals and having a prosperous career ahead of them.

Okay, so are you or any of your family members aware of the expense of a comparable quality higher education for an international student without a scholarship in India?
02/03/24, 9:49 am - +263 77 734 6504: Yes i have a slight idea
02/03/24, 10:11 am - Garima Edoofa: Let me brief you to have a better understanding.
02/03/24, 10:11 am - Garima Edoofa: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is *around 6000-8000 USD. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from USD 15000 to USD 35000. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 6-year degree ranging from USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000*.

Now as we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with over 250+ Universities for the last 14 + years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 5 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
02/03/24, 10:12 am - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
02/03/24, 10:13 am - Garima Edoofa: So, don't you think it is affordable for your family?
02/03/24, 10:15 am - +263 77 734 6504: Yes its affordable.
02/03/24, 10:17 am - +263 77 734 6504: I understand that i can also cover some of these expenses through employability
02/03/24, 10:25 am - Garima Edoofa: In simple words @263777346504 what we do is, reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost nearly $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food, and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we allow the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
02/03/24, 10:26 am - Garima Edoofa: However you meet and exceed our academic criteria with a high passing grade, he/she becomes eligible for an exclusive scholarship. With the exclusive Scholarship, you will only need to pay a minimal fee ranging from $1600-$2300, which covers your entire expenses, including food, accommodation, tuition, etc.
02/03/24, 10:26 am - Garima Edoofa: What are your thoughts about the same?
02/03/24, 10:27 am - +263 77 734 6504: Understood. 
I am so excited about this opportunity
02/03/24, 10:27 am - +263 77 734 6504: Thank you so so much.
I am delighted
02/03/24, 10:28 am - +263 77 734 6504: Sounds good and it is such an honour
02/03/24, 10:30 am - Garima Edoofa: I really appreciate that, please.
02/03/24, 10:30 am - Garima Edoofa: So, shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program?
02/03/24, 10:31 am - +263 77 734 6504: Yes
02/03/24, 10:32 am - Garima Edoofa: The Earn While You Learn Program or the *EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program*. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
02/03/24, 10:32 am - Garima Edoofa: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.


1. *Projects with Brands and Companies*: -

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0

-Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
02/03/24, 10:32 am - Garima Edoofa: 2. *Recruitment Partners*: -

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
02/03/24, 10:32 am - Garima Edoofa: 3. *Webinars*: -

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi
How to be industry ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu
It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje
Decoding the science of personal branding by Mr, Simon Maingi
02/03/24, 10:33 am - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
02/03/24, 10:33 am - Garima Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases. 

What are your views on the same? Do you think this will be benefiting you?
02/03/24, 10:38 am - +263 77 734 6504: I know that this is big for me and i will use every opportunity to build myself so that i grow in my field of study and also in society <This message was edited>
02/03/24, 10:38 am - +263 77 734 6504: I'm very positive <This message was edited>
02/03/24, 10:39 am - Garima Edoofa: That is great to know, so now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food, and accommodation*, which means for the monthly family cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
02/03/24, 10:39 am - Garima Edoofa: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

02/03/24, 10:45 am - +263 77 734 6504: I have been looking forward to this and its is so much liberating and i think I'd be more independent doing the EWYL programme
02/03/24, 10:48 am - +263 77 734 6504: This programme has helped a lot of students achieve their dreams and i am grateful for this chance,i will work hard to the end
02/03/24, 10:51 am - Garima Edoofa: I really appreciate that, please.
02/03/24, 10:51 am - Garima Edoofa: Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :

1.*Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*​: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses,which is completely waived off.
 
2.*Employability through practical training*​: We believe Students shouldn't just learn in theory, they should gain real-world experience instead of academic theory. That is why we help them by designing a practical employment oriented curriculum that helps students pick up job skills needed to be employable.
 
 
3.*Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing and involving. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What’s more, students earn scholarship credits in the process, thereby further reducing the burden of the cost of their education.
 
 
4.*Higher Education Concierge*​: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.
02/03/24, 10:52 am - Garima Edoofa: So, after looking over the facts that distinguish Edoofa, which of the four points did you appreciate the most?
02/03/24, 10:56 am - +263 77 734 6504: Its difficult to pick out a few and not mention all of them.
I appreciate all of the above,no exceptions from me
02/03/24, 11:01 am - Garima Edoofa: I am delighted to know that you have been looking for the same.


Alright Tanaka, basically, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
02/03/24, 11:02 am - +263 77 734 6504: Yes they are
02/03/24, 11:04 am - Garima Edoofa: Alright Tanaka, basically once we complete your counseling session I would give you time to properly discuss your entire application once again with your family members so that they too could have much better clarity regarding the same. Meanwhile, now that we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
02/03/24, 11:08 am - +263 77 734 6504: I am available
02/03/24, 11:08 am - +263 77 734 6504: Yes i am ready
02/03/24, 11:11 am - Garima Edoofa: @263777346504 as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
02/03/24, 11:12 am - +263 77 734 6504: About $2250 maximum <This message was edited>
02/03/24, 12:00 pm - Garima Edoofa: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
02/03/24, 12:01 pm - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
02/03/24, 12:01 pm - Garima Edoofa: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
02/03/24, 12:01 pm - Garima Edoofa: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education.

Don’t you think so?
02/03/24, 12:02 pm - Garima Edoofa: Excuse me for the delay in my response as it was my lunch break.
02/03/24, 12:02 pm - +263 77 734 6504: The amount of $750 ensures that i secure a place for university
02/03/24, 12:04 pm - Garima Edoofa: Please go through this message.
02/03/24, 12:05 pm - +263 77 734 6504: Ok understood
02/03/24, 12:06 pm - Garima Edoofa: Can you please answer this question?
02/03/24, 12:07 pm - +263 77 734 6504: So round 7 will be paying $350 and this is the only payment i have to make?
02/03/24, 12:07 pm - +263 77 734 6504: Yes i do,strongly
02/03/24, 12:10 pm - +263 77 734 6504: When can i make this payment and into which account?
02/03/24, 12:13 pm - Garima Edoofa: @263777346504 I really appreciate your encouragement for enrolling in the scholarship program, but first, we will have an eligibility check interview with our Program director then if you are found eligible then the tentative dates will be shared and the payment account details.
02/03/24, 12:13 pm - Garima Edoofa: I hope your doubt is clear now?
02/03/24, 12:14 pm - +263 77 734 6504: Yes,it is 
Thank you
02/03/24, 12:14 pm - Garima Edoofa: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
02/03/24, 12:15 pm - Garima Edoofa: @263777346504 basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
02/03/24, 12:15 pm - Garima Edoofa: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
02/03/24, 12:17 pm - +263 77 734 6504: Understood
02/03/24, 12:18 pm - Garima Edoofa: @263777346504 , as we have discussed about the payment policy of the Enrollment fee and other finances of the program as well, so can you share with me what all did you understand about the financial aspect of the program and how Edoofa helps a student arrange and pay his finances all by himself (in 80 to 100 words)?
02/03/24, 12:54 pm - +263 77 734 6504: Edoofa offers scholarships of 50-100% to deserving students .
The student will be paying at most $3000 after the scholarship deduction from $8000.
The remaining amount will be covering expenses of food,accommodation and tuition.
The EWYL programme by Edoofa allows for a student to earn scholarship credits that will be deducted from the remaining fee,the earning are also dependable on the student's work and effort.
Edoofa assist in payment of the enrollment fee and Eligible students would only pay $350 for enrollment fees which is payable with $200 deposit within 7days and the remaining $150 in the next 30days.
02/03/24, 12:57 pm - Garima Edoofa: Let me summarize the financial aspects for you
*Enrollment fee*
The enrollment fee is $350 out of which you need to pay only $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 is to be paid in next 30 days 
 
For all the services and assistance including Applications,SOP,Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection, and sessions etc all you need to pay is $350
 
 
*Cost of education*
The cost of education is reduced from $6000-$8000 to $2000-$3000 per annum which includes Tuition fee,Accommodation,Food,Wifi,Laundry,Library,Gym fee etc!
 
This cost can be further reduced through the earnings from Earn While You Learn program.
02/03/24, 12:57 pm - Garima Edoofa: I hope now you have a better understanding?
02/03/24, 1:00 pm - +263 77 734 6504: Yes i do.
02/03/24, 1:01 pm - Garima Edoofa: Yes @263777346504 and I hope that you have understood how it totally depends upon the student to make his/her higher education affordable with the help of the Earn While You Learn Program's Scholarship Credits?
02/03/24, 1:03 pm - +263 77 734 6504: Yes,,,i understand and i have seen pictures of student's certificates proving that it is dependable on the student's effort
02/03/24, 1:04 pm - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
02/03/24, 1:05 pm - Garima Edoofa: Let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image that I have shared.
02/03/24, 1:05 pm - Garima Edoofa: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zimbabwe itself.
02/03/24, 1:05 pm - Garima Edoofa: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
02/03/24, 1:07 pm - +263 77 734 6504: Well understood
02/03/24, 1:09 pm - Garima Edoofa: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that 
particular University chosen by you.
02/03/24, 1:09 pm - Garima Edoofa: Basically, this registration fee of ($500-$1000) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 instalments*. The first part will be paid in Coming few months of (2024-2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).

*After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
02/03/24, 1:10 pm - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
02/03/24, 1:10 pm - Garima Edoofa: So now would you like to ask anything?
02/03/24, 1:12 pm - +263 77 734 6504: You explained everything so well.
Right now i don't have any questions
02/03/24, 1:24 pm - Garima Edoofa: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
02/03/24, 1:24 pm - Garima Edoofa: Mrs.Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)
02/03/24, 1:24 pm - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
02/03/24, 1:25 pm - Garima Edoofa: Do connect with Mrs. Ruth with your parents as well Tanaka.
02/03/24, 1:25 pm - Garima Edoofa: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
02/03/24, 1:26 pm - Garima Edoofa: And for any questions apart from whatever we have explained, I would appreciate it if you refer your family to the FAQ document which has all the answers to most of the queries which generally parents have.

04/03/24, 1:38 pm - Garima Edoofa: Alright, please.
04/03/24, 1:43 pm - Garima Edoofa: https://chat.whatsapp.com/GQHoVgWUDV7FIryvsnrwl6
04/03/24, 1:43 pm - Garima Edoofa: please join this group.
04/03/24, 1:45 pm - Garima Edoofa: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
04/03/24, 1:45 pm - Garima Edoofa: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.

Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.
04/03/24, 1:45 pm - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
04/03/24, 1:46 pm - Garima Edoofa: Ideally as you know, the tentative dates:
1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 11th or 12th March 2024 for $200 and the 11th or 12th of April for the remaining $150.
2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 11th or 12th of March 2024. Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?
04/03/24, 3:17 pm - Garima Edoofa: Can you please answer this question?
04/03/24, 3:23 pm - +263 77 297 4333: Thank you want to pay in 7 days all the 350
04/03/24, 3:25 pm - +263 77 297 4333: Yes I'm prepard
04/03/24, 3:25 pm - +263 77 297 4333: Prepared
04/03/24, 3:26 pm - Garima Edoofa: Can you please acknowledge the same using a voice note, please.

06/03/24, 9:11 am - +263 77 297 4333: 🙏🙏🙏 Thank you

06/03/24, 9:20 am - +263 77 734 6504: Yes i have
06/03/24, 9:21 am - Garima Edoofa: May I know if your parents have gone through the Letter Of Acceptance?
06/03/24, 9:22 am - +263 77 297 4333: Will go through it im travelling to Gweru
06/03/24, 9:28 am - +263 77 297 4333: As soon as i go through it all  will advise
06/03/24, 9:33 am - Garima Edoofa: I would really appreciate it if you go through the Letter Of Acceptance.
06/03/24, 9:48 am - +263 77 297 4333: In terms of payment I prefer  using banc account
06/03/24, 10:01 am - +263 77 297 4333: Bank
06/03/24, 10:01 am - Garima Edoofa: Alright please, however since you must have seen, there are two modes of fee payments mentioned:-

1. Direct Bank Transfer to our Parent Company's account
2. Deposit in our associate's account over there in Zimbabwe

Which mode according to you would be convenient, so that I can brief you in-depth about that particular mode?
06/03/24, 10:02 am - +263 77 297 4333: Mode 1
06/03/24, 10:03 am - Garima Edoofa: @263777346504 basically you see in the first mode, the Direct Bank Transfer Mode, the transfer charges which are to be borne by the parents of the student ranges between $100 to $120 which become quite high for a lot of parents considering the economic situation in Zimbabwe itself. So as not every student is in a position to cater for an additional $100 to $120 just as transfer charge, the second mode was introduced, wherein, it is the Bank deposit in Mr. Charles's Account, in this the transfer charges get divided amongst 10 students resulting in an equivalent bearing of 12.5% at the end.

So as you can see in the letter that there is a Bank deposit in, Mr. Charles Jerera (Retired Education Officer)'s account as he is our Associated Partner there in Zimbabwe, Since 2020 there have been over 1400+ students who have been assisted by Mr Charles inorder to complete their enrollment formalities as well as university fee payments after arriving in India.
06/03/24, 10:03 am - Garima Edoofa: Therefore the fee can also be paid through him. Since his account is a NOSTRO Account which only holds USD itself, therefore the necessary amount including the transfer charges in this mode itself would be $394 ($350 + $44 transfer charges), and the same details are as below:-

BANK NAME: FBC
