06/03/24, 9:17 am - Garima Edoofa: Good Morning @263780232384 , Hope you are doing well.

I am here to Begin with our session, shall we start?
06/03/24, 7:24 pm - Garima Edoofa: I was expecting your response in the counselling session, but you could not get back to me due to some reason so I am about to finish my second counselling slot for the day, I will have to schedule your session for Tomorrow at 9:30 AM CAT.

Please note that I have two counseling slots in a day which are during my working hours from 9:00 am to 4:30 pm on Monday to Friday, and from 9:00 am to 1:00 pm on Saturday so to complete your application you would have to be present during the time. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning. Therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.
07/03/24, 9:03 am - Garima Edoofa: Good Morning @263780232384 , Hope you are doing well.

I am here to Begin with our session, shall we start?
07/03/24, 7:03 pm - Garima Edoofa: Hi, I hope you are doing well.

I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons which I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship. 

I will be waiting for your response.
07/03/24, 8:53 pm - +263 78 023 2384: Good evening @919045457711 I'm really sorry for late replying.... I was busy with some school projects

08/03/24, 8:39 am - Garima Edoofa: Good Morning @263780232384 , Hope you are doing well.

I am here to continue our session, shall we start?
08/03/24, 9:53 pm - Garima Edoofa: Hi, I hope you are doing well!

I was waiting for you to share your concerns with me but unfortunately, I didn’t hear from you and therefore I was asked to put your application on hold, but before doing the same, I was going through the form you submitted, I noticed that you come from family background wherein you plan to pursue your higher education abroad and was looking for a scholarship. I am looking forward to hearing from you so that I can make your dream of higher education abroad come true through an affordable, accessible and employment-oriented higher education program.

I will be waiting for your response.
