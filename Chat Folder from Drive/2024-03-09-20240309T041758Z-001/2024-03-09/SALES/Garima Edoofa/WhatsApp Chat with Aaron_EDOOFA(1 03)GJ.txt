01/03/24, 2:54 pm - Garima Edoofa: EDOOFA has praised the new government for its strong commitment and positive reforms in the education sector.

The elimination of school fees, increase in the number of teachers, and keeping vulnerable learners, especially adolescent girls, in school are some of the notable positive reforms.

EDOOFA is deeply honored to support the government in its endeavor to transform the education sector to achieve Sustainable Development which seeks to ensure inclusive and equitable quality education between now and 2030.

After our successful visit to Zambia and meetings at the Ministries, we have already begun conducting Scholarship Tests and Counseling Sessions at eminent schools in Zambia.

Also, Edoofa is looking for deserving candidates who are meritorious and seek affordable education in the world’s second-largest higher education space.

Our strong partnerships with educational institutions like Penmal Connect Ltd., and Trident College from Zambia have paved the way for numerous success stories along with various institutions like Kamulanga High, Canisius Secondary, National Hillcrest, Matero Boys Secondary, etc! We are also connected with the likes of Njase, Ndola Girls, Fatima Secondary, Torbit, and Zambezi Boarding among many others to 
offer, build and extend the opportunity of the Edoofa Scholarship Program to more and more deserving students across Zambia.

 *B.Tech Civil Engineering*
So may I know does this course aligns you and May I know if you've managed to do any research about this course, please?
02/03/24, 1:02 pm - +260 97 2430378: Not really but I have some knowledge about
02/03/24, 1:02 pm - +260 97 2430378: It
02/03/24, 1:03 pm - Garima Edoofa: So, shall I brief you about the course?
02/03/24, 1:04 pm - +260 97 2430378: Yes, please
02/03/24, 1:07 pm - Garima Edoofa: ​*B.Tech Civil Engineering: What is it About?*

Civil engineering is one of the oldest engineering disciplines in the world. Civil engineering, until a few decades back, was a much sought after course among Indian students, but lately has been sidelined due to the software and IT boom. However with the increasing need to develop and maintain India’s infrastructure, which is lagging in all aspects, this field is bouncing back strongly.

There are options for higher studies after the completion of B.Tech. course. Students can pursue Master’s degree in specialized course. Master of Technology (M.Tech.) in Civil engineering and other allied branches like-

*Structural Engineering*
*Architectural Engineering*
*Geotechnical Engineering*
*Environmental Engineering etc.*

*B.Tech Civil Engineering: Who should opt?*

Before you decide to pursue your undergraduate studies in this field, it is important to understand that Civil engineering is not just about buildings and bridges. If you are under the assumption that all that civil engineers do is wear a yellow helmet and supervise workers in construction sites, then you are yet to understand the true capacity of this field. 


*Career aspects*

In these cases, you will have to hunt for a core engineering job all by yourself through off-campus placements. Creating strong professional networks, developing a great resume with stellar GPA and doing impressive projects and internships will help you secure a job in one of the core civil engineering companies.

Also, civil engineers find work not just in construction industry, but also in other industries such as oil and energy, transportation, petroleum, environmental, power and electric utilities, chemical etc where infrastructure projects and construction facilities are involved. Some students transition to software, consulting or banking as they feel that salary and growth prospects are better in these sectors.
02/03/24, 1:08 pm - Garima Edoofa: I would want you to go through the course properly and understand it, inform me once you are done.
02/03/24, 1:12 pm - +260 97 2430378: Alright
02/03/24, 1:15 pm - +260 97 2430378: I am done
02/03/24, 2:26 pm - Garima Edoofa: May I know if this course aligns with you?
02/03/24, 4:33 pm - +260 97 2430378: Yes it does
04/03/24, 8:42 am - Garima Edoofa: Good Morning @260972430378 @260977937690 @260974201599 , Hope you are doing well.

I am here to continue with our session, shall we start?
04/03/24, 8:43 am - +260 97 2430378: Good morning
04/03/24, 8:43 am - +260 97 2430378: Sure we can
04/03/24, 8:46 am - Garima Edoofa: Since you have understood the course properly.

Can you now tell me, if you are provided with this career option, how do you see yourself 5 years after the completion of this course?
And if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
04/03/24, 8:49 am - +260 97 2430378: If I had the opportunity to pursue this career option, I would see myself as a highly skilled and knowledgeable professional who is able to use my skills to make a positive impact on the world. As for Edoofa, I would say that its program would help me achieve my dreams by providing me with the right resources and support to grow and develop as a professional. With the right guidance, I believe that I can reach my full potential and make a difference in the world <This message was edited>
04/03/24, 9:00 am - Garima Edoofa: I appreciate and admire your foresightedness at the same time,@260972430378 

However, as your concierge, I would like to share with you that the career path which you have chosen ahead, will require a lot of hard work and dedication.

So are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way in order to transform your career dear?
04/03/24, 9:02 am - +260 97 2430378: Yes I am Mrs Garima
04/03/24, 9:07 am - Garima Edoofa: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
04/03/24, 9:16 am - +260 97 2430378: It has always been my dream ...  there are a number of reasons why I’d like to study abroad rather than in my home country. For one, I think it would be an incredible opportunity to experience a different culture and learn about the world in a new and exciting way. I also believe that studying abroad would provide me with new perspectives and insights that I wouldn’t be able to get if I stayed in my own country. Additionally, I think it would be a great way to expand my network and meet new people from all over the world.
04/03/24, 9:52 am - Garima Edoofa: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
04/03/24, 9:59 am - +260 97 2430378: I think that the knowledge and skills I would gain by studying abroad could have a significant impact on the education system in my home country. I would be able to bring back new ideas and best practices that could be implemented to improve the quality of education for future generations. Additionally, I could use my knowledge and experience to advocate for change and create awareness about the importance of education in my home country. Ultimately, I believe that the exposure and experience I would gain by studying abroad would enable me to make a positive and lasting impact on the education system in my home country.
04/03/24, 10:05 am - Garima Edoofa: I appreciate your sense of hard work for your community @260972430378 , but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?
04/03/24, 10:10 am - +260 97 2430378: Yes I do agree
04/03/24, 10:18 am - Garima Edoofa: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
04/03/24, 10:19 am - +260 97 2430378: Yes I am
04/03/24, 10:24 am - Garima Edoofa: The Edoofa Scholarship Program is only focused in India, because of the following reasons

04/03/24, 10:51 am - Garima Edoofa: Okay well Aaron, since you have understood all the reasons properly as well, can you now tell me:-

1)How would studying in India have a positive impact on your career?

2)How do you aim to achieve your career aspirations from studying in India?
04/03/24, 10:58 am - +260 97 2430378: To answer your first question, studying in India would have a positive impact on my career for a number of reasons. Firstly, I would have the opportunity to gain in-depth knowledge about the local culture, business practices, and industry trends in India. This would give me a significant advantage in the global marketplace and make me a more attractive candidate for employers. Secondly, I would be able to build a strong professional network in India, which could lead to career opportunities and valuable connections. Finally, the cost of living and tuition fees in India are generally much lower than in many other countries, so I would be able to save money and invest in
04/03/24, 10:59 am - +260 97 2430378: Well, to achieve my career aspirations from studying in India, I would focus on gaining the right skills and knowledge, building a strong network, and making the most of the opportunities available to me. Firstly, I would make sure to take relevant courses and gain practical experience in my chosen field. Secondly, I would actively participate in extracurricular activities and join student organizations to build a strong network of like-minded individuals. Finally, I would take advantage of internship opportunities and job fairs to get a head start on my career. By doing all of these things, I believe I can achieve my career goals and make the most of my
04/03/24, 11:00 am - Garima Edoofa: That is remarkable, @260972430378 . I see that you understand the quality of higher education that Edoofa seeks to deliver to its students so that after completing the education, the student is capable of achieving their career goals and having a prosperous career ahead of them.

Okay, so are you or any of your family members aware of the expense of a comparable quality higher education for an international student without a scholarship in India?
04/03/24, 11:01 am - +260 97 2430378: Not really
04/03/24, 11:02 am - Garima Edoofa: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is *around 6000-8000 USD. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from USD 15000 to USD 35000. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 6-year degree ranging from USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000*.

Now as we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with over 250+ Universities for the last 14 + years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 5 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
04/03/24, 11:03 am - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
04/03/24, 11:03 am - Garima Edoofa: So, don't you think it is affordable for you and your family?
04/03/24, 11:11 am - +260 97 2430378: That all depends on what my parents have to say ma'am
04/03/24, 11:39 am - Garima Edoofa: In simple words @260972430378 what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
04/03/24, 11:39 am - Garima Edoofa: What are your thoughts about the same?
04/03/24, 11:45 am - +260 97 2430378: I think it's something good
04/03/24, 12:16 pm - Garima Edoofa: So, shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program?
04/03/24, 2:31 pm - +260 97 2430378: Yes , please
04/03/24, 2:47 pm - Garima Edoofa: The Earn While You Learn Program or the *EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program*. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
04/03/24, 2:47 pm - Garima Edoofa: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.


1. *Projects with Brands and Companies*: -

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0

-Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
04/03/24, 2:47 pm - Garima Edoofa: 2. *Recruitment Partners*: -

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
04/03/24, 2:47 pm - Garima Edoofa: 3. *Webinars*: -

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi
How to be industry ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu
It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje
Decoding the science of personal branding by Mr, Simon Maingi
04/03/24, 2:47 pm - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
04/03/24, 2:47 pm - Garima Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases. 

What are your views on the same? Do you think this will be benefiting you?
04/03/24, 2:58 pm - +260 97 2430378: My views are that this program  is really helpful and  it give experience to students while they are learning
04/03/24, 2:58 pm - +260 97 2430378: I think it will be benefiting me
04/03/24, 3:03 pm - Garima Edoofa: Yes, indeed.
04/03/24, 3:04 pm - Garima Edoofa: That is great to know, so now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food, and accommodation*, which means for the monthly family cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
04/03/24, 3:04 pm - Garima Edoofa: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

04/03/24, 3:17 pm - Garima Edoofa: Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :

1.*Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*​: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses,which is completely waived off.
 
2.*Employability through practical training*​: We believe Students shouldn't just learn in theory, they should gain real-world experience instead of academic theory. That is why we help them by designing a practical employment oriented curriculum that helps students pick up job skills needed to be employable.
 
 
3.*Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing and involving. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What’s more, students earn scholarship credits in the process, thereby further reducing the burden of the cost of their education.
 
 
4.*Higher Education Concierge*​: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.
04/03/24, 3:17 pm - Garima Edoofa: So, after looking over the facts that distinguish Edoofa, which of the four points did you appreciate the most?
04/03/24, 7:50 pm - +260 97 2430378: All of them
04/03/24, 8:13 pm - Garima Edoofa: I am delighted to know that you have been looking for the same.


Alright @260972430378 , basically, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
04/03/24, 8:25 pm - +260 97 2430378: Alright 


Does this mean I haven't gotten the scholarship
04/03/24, 8:30 pm - Garima Edoofa: @260972430378 Currently, we are engaged in a counseling session. Following this, there will be an eligibility check interview with the program director. If you pass this interview, you will be eligible for the scholarship. 

I hope now you are clear?
04/03/24, 8:57 pm - +260 97 2430378: Yes I am
04/03/24, 9:07 pm - Garima Edoofa: So, now can you answer this question?
04/03/24, 9:14 pm - +260 97 2430378: Yes they are
04/03/24, 9:14 pm - Garima Edoofa: Alright @260972430378 , basically once we complete your counseling session I would give you time to properly discuss about your entire application once again with your family members so that they too could have much better clarity regarding the same. Meanwhile, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
04/03/24, 9:31 pm - +260 97 2430378: Yes
04/03/24, 9:32 pm - Garima Edoofa: @260972430378 as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
04/03/24, 9:36 pm - +260 97 2430378: $1500-$2250
04/03/24, 9:36 pm - Garima Edoofa: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
04/03/24, 9:36 pm - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
04/03/24, 9:36 pm - Garima Edoofa: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
04/03/24, 9:36 pm - Garima Edoofa: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education.

Don’t you think so?
04/03/24, 9:40 pm - +260 97 2430378: Yes I do think so
04/03/24, 9:41 pm - Garima Edoofa: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
04/03/24, 9:41 pm - Garima Edoofa: @260972430378 basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
04/03/24, 9:41 pm - Garima Edoofa: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
04/03/24, 9:45 pm - +260 97 2430378: Understood
04/03/24, 9:46 pm - Garima Edoofa: @260972430378, as we have discussed the payment policy of the Enrollment fee and other finances of the program as well, so can you share with me what you understand about the financial aspect of the program and how Edoofa helps a student arrange and pay his finances all by himself (in 80 to 100 words)?
04/03/24, 9:58 pm - +260 97 2430378: What I understand by the financial aspect of the program is that   for a student to be part of the edoofa program he or she is suppose to pay a program fee of $350 if they are found competent for the program within a period of 7 days ... Due to some countries facing economic instability ,parents are allowed to pay a fee of $200 that's if they are unable to pay the whole amount and the rest of the $150 can be paid within a period of 30 days 

The Edoofa program helps a student arrange and pay his finances through  his or her earn while you learn program ,the program can help a student pay his or her first year  annual  fee if at all they get admission
04/03/24, 9:59 pm - Garima Edoofa: Let me summarize the financial aspects for you
*Enrollment fee*
The enrollment fee is $350 out of which you need to pay only $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 is to be paid in next 30 days 
 
For all the services and assistance including Applications,SOP,Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection, and sessions etc all you need to pay is $350
 
 
*Cost of education*
The cost of education is reduced from $6000-$8000 to $2000-$3000 per annum which includes Tuition fee,Accommodation,Food,Wifi,Laundry,Library,Gym fee etc!
 
This cost can be further reduced through the earnings from Earn While You Learn program.
04/03/24, 9:59 pm - Garima Edoofa: I hope now it is clear?
04/03/24, 10:01 pm - +260 97 2430378: Yes it is ma'am
04/03/24, 10:01 pm - Garima Edoofa: Yes @260972430378 and I hope that you have understood how it totally depends upon the student to make his/her higher education affordable with the help of the Earn While You Learn Program's Scholarship Credits?
04/03/24, 10:02 pm - +260 97 2430378: Yes I have
04/03/24, 10:05 pm - Garima Edoofa: While reviewing your Application Form, I noticed that you have selected 2025 as your preferred year of intake. I am curious to understand the reasons behind your preference for the 2025 intake over the 2024 intake. Could you please elaborate on your decision?
04/03/24, 10:07 pm - +260 97 2430378: I went for 2025 because  the person who connected me to Edoofa told me that the entire process would take a maximum period of six months .
04/03/24, 10:11 pm - Garima Edoofa: @260972430378 As your career counselor, I recommend considering the 2024 intake, given that you have completed Grade 12. In my view, it would be beneficial for you to proceed with the 2024 intake rather than waiting for the 2025 intake, as this would allow you to make the most of your time and not delay your academic progression.
04/03/24, 10:11 pm - +260 97 2430378: That's fine with me ma'am 2024 is fine
04/03/24, 10:12 pm - Garima Edoofa: I really appreciate your decision, please.
04/03/24, 10:13 pm - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
04/03/24, 10:13 pm - Garima Edoofa: Let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
04/03/24, 10:13 pm - +260 97 2430378: Sure Ms Garima
04/03/24, 10:13 pm - Garima Edoofa: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zimbabwe itself.
04/03/24, 10:13 pm - Garima Edoofa: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
04/03/24, 10:15 pm - +260 97 2430378: Yes I do
04/03/24, 10:16 pm - Garima Edoofa: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that 
particular University chosen by you.
04/03/24, 10:16 pm - Garima Edoofa: Basically, this registration fee of ($500-$1000) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 instalments*. The first part will be paid in Coming few months of (2024-2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).

*After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
04/03/24, 10:16 pm - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
04/03/24, 10:16 pm - Garima Edoofa: So now would you like to ask anything?
04/03/24, 10:20 pm - +260 97 2430378: Will the registration fee be deducted from my earn while you learn
04/03/24, 10:23 pm - Garima Edoofa: Let me help you understand. This registration fee of $500 to $1000 is to be paid by the student/parent to reserve their scholarship seat with the university and it is not an additional cost, it is part of your first-year tuition fee which is paid while you are in your home country and it will be adjusted against your first-year cost of education hence making your registration fee as zero.

I hope we are clear here?
04/03/24, 10:25 pm - +260 97 2430378: Yes we are
04/03/24, 10:29 pm - Garima Edoofa: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
04/03/24, 10:29 pm - Garima Edoofa: Mrs.Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)
04/03/24, 10:29 pm - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
04/03/24, 10:29 pm - Garima Edoofa: Do connect Mrs. Ruth with your parents as well Aaron.
04/03/24, 10:29 pm - Garima Edoofa: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
04/03/24, 10:29 pm - Garima Edoofa: And for any questions apart from whatever we have explained, I would appreciate it if you refer your family to the FAQ document which has all the answers to most of the queries which generally parents have.
04/03/24, 10:30 pm - Garima Edoofa: Also, have a look at some pictures of the students who came to India recently for their Academic Session.

04/03/24, 10:31 pm - Garima Edoofa: Dear Aaron,

Your scholarship journey is reaching a crucial juncture. *Tuesday on “5-03-24” at 10:00 AM CAT,* I will meticulously evaluate your application. This session is not just about answering your questions; it includes a vital Eligibility Check Interview.

We strongly recommend parents/guardians join, recognizing that higher education is a family decision. Prepare for a series of interviews, marking a significant phase in finalizing your scholarship application. As your counselor, I wish you the very best. It's been a pleasure guiding you through your career sessions.

If you qualify for the interview, *Senior Career Counselor Mr Sahil would be getting in touch*, we look forward to welcoming you to India. Please be proactive, as everyone's time is valuable. The Senior Counselor and Director will make decisions based on your interview and adhere strictly to the given time. Follow instructions diligently, and if the session is completed within the allotted time, your application will proceed.

Happy Family Discussion!
Stay Blessed!

The process was challenging, yet incredibly rewarding. Mrs. Ruth's determination, combined with Edoofa's assistance, has paved the way for a brighter future .

05/03/24, 10:58 am - +260 97 2430378: @260974201599 @260977937690

05/03/24, 11:04 am - Garima Edoofa: I would like to inform you that without parent's acknowledgment in the group, we can't proceed ahead with the process.
05/03/24, 11:05 am - +260 97 2430378: 5:30 pm CAT
05/03/24, 11:05 am - +260 97 2430378: Apologies for them not been here at the moment but they will soon Ms Garima
05/03/24, 11:29 am - Garima Edoofa: I will be waiting for there response on the group, please.
05/03/24, 11:29 am - +260 97 2430378: Alright

05/03/24, 3:12 pm - +260 97 2430378: No not yet ma'am
05/03/24, 3:17 pm - Garima Edoofa: Alright, please.
05/03/24, 3:17 pm - Garima Edoofa: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
05/03/24, 3:17 pm - Garima Edoofa: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.

Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.
05/03/24, 3:17 pm - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
05/03/24, 3:19 pm - Garima Edoofa: Ideally as you know, the tentative dates:
1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 12th or 13th March 2024 for $200 and the 12th or 13th of April for the remaining $150.
2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 12th or 13th of March 2024. Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?
05/03/24, 3:21 pm - +260 97 2430378: I live in Zambia ma'am
05/03/24, 3:22 pm - Garima Edoofa: Excuse me for that, please as I was sharing the same information with the other applicant who has almost completed the Enrollment Process.
05/03/24, 3:23 pm - Garima Edoofa: I would want your parents to answer this question, please.
05/03/24, 3:24 pm - +260 97 2430378: Quite excused
05/03/24, 3:26 pm - Garima Edoofa: Alright, please.
05/03/24, 7:23 pm - Garima Edoofa: @260972430378 I am still waiting for your parents to respond on the group?
05/03/24, 7:48 pm - +260 97 4201599: Good evening. I'm sorry for responding late. On behalf of the father, I am the mother we are not prepared financially for the above payment
05/03/24, 7:48 pm - Garima Edoofa: Good Evening @260974201599, Hope you are doing well.
05/03/24, 7:49 pm - Garima Edoofa: May I know what challenges you are facing?
05/03/24, 7:58 pm - +260 97 4201599: We have financial challenges despite being in employment, the salaries we get can't afford, we are both more like bread winners in both families and  the families depend on us ,I personally  have have a mother who is suffering  from breast cancer we are ever in and out of the hospital .
05/03/24, 8:06 pm - Garima Edoofa: I understand your concern, please.

Some parents are having financial issues and despite that factor, they are paying the enrollment fee because they do not want their child's future to end up in the same as them. And I believe you also want the best for your child?
05/03/24, 8:08 pm - Garima Edoofa: These are just the tentative dates, And we do have 2 options in which you can pay the Enrollment Fees, that is you can pay the $200 in the 7 days and the remaining $150 in the next 30 days or you can pay the whole $350 at once in the 7 days, Once you clear the eligibility check interview with Our Program Director.
05/03/24, 9:12 pm - Garima Edoofa: I was expecting your response in the counselling session, but you could not get back to me due to some reason so I am about to finish my second counselling slot for the day, I will have to schedule your session for *Tomorrow at 9:30 AM CAT.*

Please note that I have two counseling slots in a day which are during my working hours from *9:00 am to 4:30 pm on Monday to Friday, and from 9:00 am to 1:00 pm* on Saturday so to complete your application you would have to be present during the time.

06/03/24, 10:29 am - Garima Edoofa: I understand what you are sharing, but considering that you have applied for the scholarship for your higher education, I believe your parents must have done some preparation beforehand for your higher education?
06/03/24, 10:32 am - +260 97 2430378: Yes ma'am they did but due to circumstances beyond there control such as my grandmother been in hospital ,they ended up having a financial problem

07/03/24, 9:59 am - +260 97 2430378: Yes we can
07/03/24, 10:03 am - Garima Edoofa: @260972430378 I understand that your parents have planned for your education next year, But considering that you have completed your Grade 12, so may I know if are you planning to wait for one whole year and then start?
07/03/24, 10:10 am - +260 97 2430378: I personally wouldn't want that but looking at the circumstances that have befallen them ,am okay with waiting
07/03/24, 10:18 am - Garima Edoofa: Alright, @260972430378In this scenario, I recommend reserving your seat for the 2025 scholarship intake by enrolling in a program. Many students are doing the same by paying the enrollment fee, and by doing so, you can enjoy several perks. Enrolling in the program will kickstart your "Earn While You Learn" sessions. This opportunity allows you to start earning even before attending college, which can help reduce the financial burden on your parents.
07/03/24, 10:37 am - +260 97 2430378: Alright Ms Garima
07/03/24, 10:56 am - Garima Edoofa: I appreciate your decision, please.

I am here to continue our session, shall we start?
08/03/24, 11:56 am - +260 97 2430378: Good morning .....yes we can
08/03/24, 2:39 pm - Garima Edoofa: Can your parents please answer this question?
08/03/24, 9:51 pm - Garima Edoofa: Hi, I hope you are doing well.

I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons which I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship. 

I will be waiting for your response.
