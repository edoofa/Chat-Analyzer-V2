08/03/24, 2:23 pm - +91 88105 45912: Good Afternoon Dear Parents and Student 

I understand that you were a part of the grand event and presentation by the esteemed Founders of the Edoofa Program Mr. Angad Singh and Mr. Avreen Singh. 

*Your results for the ESAT 2024 is 72/100*


Congratulations on Sailing Through! *I request you and your Parents and Guardians to be active on the group so that we continue with the Counseling Session with you and your family.*
08/03/24, 2:33 pm - +263 78 218 8162: I'm sorry they are at work now so they will be active starting from seven o'clock
08/03/24, 2:38 pm - +91 88105 45912: I understand, please.

In that case, I believe you can continue with the session.
08/03/24, 2:39 pm - +91 88105 45912: Dear Parent and Student, we understand you have gone through the Brochures and Flyers of the Edoofa Program.
To emphasize  *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and has been rewarding meritorious students to lower their Fee Structure less than what you will end up paying at the Local Zimbabwe University.
08/03/24, 2:44 pm - +263 78 218 8162: When l went through the brochure l could not find medicine program. Does this mean that you don't offer scholarships on that program?
08/03/24, 2:44 pm - +263 78 218 8162: Thank you for understanding.
08/03/24, 2:45 pm - +91 88105 45912: We do offer Science related program, please.
08/03/24, 2:45 pm - +91 88105 45912: Okay so @263782188162 , as we start discussing your results further, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 


Qualification to the ESAT Exam (Please note EDOOFA calculates your results based on the TOP performers' Score so it is the percentile that we will be evaluating on)
A Level and Previous Results 
*Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 
*Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling.
Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these Four  significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
08/03/24, 2:47 pm - +263 78 218 8162: Yes, l believe l will get it.
08/03/24, 3:10 pm - +91 88105 45912: Alright so @263782188162 , now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.

I would like to know you better as a student, so please go ahead, and tell me a bit about yourself, your education, what you wish to study, your strengths, your weaknesses, your hobbies, and a detailed description of your family background, *Where do your parents work (Place) in your country or any other country that they have relocated to due to work promises?  Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work) since I honestly don't know a lot about you?*
08/03/24, 9:43 pm - +91 88105 45912: I was expecting your response in the counselling session, but you could not get back to me due to some reason so I am about to finish my second counselling slot for the day, I will have to schedule your session for *Tomorrow at 9:30 AM CAT.*

Please note that I have two counseling slots in a day which are during my working hours from *9:00 am to 4:30 pm on Monday to Friday, and from 9:00 am to 1:00 pm* on Saturday so to complete your application you would have to be present during the time. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning. Therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.
