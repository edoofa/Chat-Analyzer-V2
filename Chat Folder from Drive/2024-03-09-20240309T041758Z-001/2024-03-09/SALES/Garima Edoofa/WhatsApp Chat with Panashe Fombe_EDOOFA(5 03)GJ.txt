In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 


Qualification to the ESAT Exam (Please note EDOOFA calculates your results based on the TOP performers' Score so it is the percentile that we will be evaluating on)
A Level and Previous Results 
*Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 
*Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these Four  significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?

The main role of a legal advisor or legal counsellor is to offer legal advice and work, for organizations and the employees of the organization. Their services can be utilized by the Government, NGOs, other associations or large organizations. The legal advisors are in-house experts, in contrast to attorneys and supporters who offer their services to society in general. It is often seen that legal advisors were former advocates and therefore their skills and training have to be in accordance with those that are needed for attorneys and advocates.
*2) Lawyer*
As is evident by the title, is a person whose profession is law. There are different specializations for law including Cyber law, Environmental law, Company law, Criminal law and Family Law.

06/03/24, 10:48 am - Garima Edoofa: A career in law is considered to be much sought after, satisfying and lucrative.
*Required Skill-Set for BA LLB*
It is rightly said that learning is an on – going process and this holds true especially in the aspect of personal and professional development. Although an individual may possess certain skills they need to be improved and developed constantly. A few key skills that are of paramount importance in the field of law are:
*Good Written Communication*– Writing forms a major part of the work in in the legal profession. The written communication involves letters, documents, notices, and so on. The documents must be grammatically correct and error free. This requires a good level of English proficiency.
*Good Verbal Communication*– A lot depends on how well the legal professional can express his or her case, arguments and generally converse with clients and authorities. Good verbal communication ensures good expression and understanding which are crucial for a successful career in law.
*Good Time Management*– In the legal profession, time management is very crucial. The art of delegating tasks, working within deadlines, and prioritizing tasks to achieve success is very essential.
*A great degree of self-confidence*– This profession needs a high degree of self-confidence to win the clients’ trust. A strong belief in yourself will go a long way in winning arguments and cases.

*Good Commercial awareness*– This is not only restricted to being aware of the current trends and technology, prevalent in the world of business and law, but also being aware of the developments in the world of business and law, both nationally and globally.
*A high degree of patience*– This is a much needed skill, since you deal with different types of people and some cases and procedures stretch over a period of time which need a lot of patience and careful handling.
*Team player skills*– Since a legal professional will deal with a lot of people therefore to be effective they need to bond with people. The art of getting work done and obtaining information though networking and working with people helps in attaining the objectives.

06/03/24, 12:12 pm - Garima Edoofa: Alright NAME, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zimbabwe itself.

07/03/24, 10:17 am - +263 71 318 5965: Yes indeed
07/03/24, 10:19 am - Garima Edoofa: Are your parents ready for the same?
07/03/24, 10:19 am - +263 77 341 8456: Yes
07/03/24, 10:19 am - +263 71 318 5965: Yes
07/03/24, 10:20 am - Garima Edoofa: I would want your parents to acknowledge the same using a voice note, please.
07/03/24, 10:20 am - +263 77 680 5115: Yes
07/03/24, 10:21 am - +263 77 341 8456: <Media omitted>
07/03/24, 10:21 am - Garima Edoofa: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
07/03/24, 10:21 am - Garima Edoofa: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.

Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.
07/03/24, 10:21 am - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
07/03/24, 10:22 am - Garima Edoofa: Ideally as you know, the tentative dates:
1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 14th or 15th March 2024 for $200 and the 14th or 15th of April for the remaining $150.
2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 14th or 15th of March 2024. Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?
07/03/24, 10:32 am - +263 77 341 8456: I go for option 2 I will pay at once
07/03/24, 10:50 am - Garima Edoofa: Can you please acknowledge the same using a voice note.
07/03/24, 10:51 am - +263 77 341 8456: <Media omitted>

Since the results were shared over email, you are supposed to acknowledge them as well.

For your convenience, let me share the Letter of Acceptance for Panashe over here as well so that you can go through it and let me know.
08/03/24, 10:08 am - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
08/03/24, 10:10 am - +263 71 318 5965: Thank you so much ma'am 🙏
08/03/24, 10:11 am - Garima Edoofa: Please go through the Letter Of Acceptance properly, and let me know once you are done.
08/03/24, 10:21 am - +263 71 318 5965: I'm done ma'am
08/03/24, 10:22 am - +263 77 341 8456: We thank you very much for accepting our child. May God bless you. 👏👏👏
08/03/24, 10:24 am - +263 77 680 5115: Thank you so much ma'am
08/03/24, 10:39 am - Garima Edoofa: I really appreciate it, please.
08/03/24, 10:39 am - Garima Edoofa: May I know if you all have gone through the Letter Of Acceptance properly?
08/03/24, 10:41 am - +263 71 318 5965: Yes
08/03/24, 10:42 am - Garima Edoofa: Alright please, however since you must have seen, there are two modes of fee payments mentioned:-

1. Direct Bank Transfer to our Parent Company's account
2. Deposit in our associate's account over there in Zimbabwe

Which mode according to you would be convenient, so that I can brief you in-depth about that particular mode?
08/03/24, 11:21 am - +263 77 341 8456: I would prefer number 2
08/03/24, 11:23 am - Garima Edoofa: @263713185965 basically you see in the first mode, the Direct Bank Transfer Mode, the transfer charges which are to be borne by the parents of the student ranges between $100 to $120 which become quite high for a lot of parents considering the economic situation in Zimbabwe itself. So as not every student is in a position to cater for an additional $100 to $120 just as transfer charge, the second mode was introduced, wherein, it is the Bank deposit in Mr. Charles's Account, in this the transfer charges get divided amongst 10 students resulting in an equivalent bearing of 12.5% at the end.

So as you can see in the letter that there is a Bank deposit in, Mr. Charles Jerera (Retired Education Officer)'s account as he is our Associated Partner there in Zimbabwe, Since 2020 there have been over 1400+ students who have been assisted by Mr Charles inorder to complete their enrollment formalities as well as university fee payments after arriving in India.
08/03/24, 11:23 am - Garima Edoofa: Therefore the fee can also be paid through him. Since his account is a NOSTRO Account which only holds USD itself, therefore the necessary amount including the transfer charges in this mode itself would be $394 ($350 + $44 transfer charges), and the same details are as below:-

BANK NAME: FBC

SWIFT CODE: FBCPZWHA

ACC NAME: CHARLES JERERA

08/03/24, 11:52 am - Garima Edoofa: Yes, sure you can call Mr. Jerera
08/03/24, 1:16 pm - +263 77 341 8456: I will make payment tomorrow at FBC Makoni
08/03/24, 1:31 pm - Garima Edoofa: Alright, please.
