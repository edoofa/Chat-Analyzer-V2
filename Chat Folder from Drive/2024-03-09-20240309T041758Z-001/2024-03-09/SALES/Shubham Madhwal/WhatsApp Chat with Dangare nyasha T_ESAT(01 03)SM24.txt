To emphasize  *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and has been rewarding meritorious students to lower their Fee Structure less than what you will end up paying at the Local Zimbabwe University

02/03/24, 10:24 am - Shubham Madhwal: Okay so Nyasha, as we start discussing your results further, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 


Qualification to the ESAT Exam (Please note EDOOFA calculates your results based on the TOP performers' Score so it is the percentile that we will be evaluating on)
A Level and Previous Results 
*Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 
*Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these Four  significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?

05/03/24, 2:07 pm - +263 77 106 3710: So how many points do I need to obtain at A level if I am doing Arts subjects inorder to do this degree .
05/03/24, 2:31 pm - Shubham Madhwal: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it
05/03/24, 2:47 pm - +263 77 106 3710: Yes ,I am very confident .

06/03/24, 10:02 am - +263 77 106 3710: Ok Sir ,that is fine

06/03/24, 11:09 am - Shubham Madhwal: So for an Edoofian the Enrollment Fee would include:

06/03/24, 11:23 am - Shubham Madhwal: You see Edoofa's exceptional program has opened up a world of opportunities for aspiring students, garnering thousands of applications on a daily basis. The Eligibility Evaluation process ensures that deserving candidates are granted the chance to participate in the program. *Once accepted, students are requested to pay a nominal Program Fee of $350 within 7 days of receiving their acceptance letter*, following which they commence with their admission process and the esteemed Earn While You Learn Program. Edoofa's mission to provide quality education and support to students is at the heart of this initiative, and we are honored to make a difference in the lives of deserving individuals through this program.
06/03/24, 11:24 am - Shubham Madhwal: Despite, your Low results of ESAT, I have specially recommended her application for an additional waiver of *USD 50* in your Enrollment Fee upon your consideration in the Slice Con 24 Committee Fund. 

Out of a total of 3000 students only 200 have been given this opportunity, as a counsellor I feel it is a great privilege that has been offered to you.
06/03/24, 11:36 am - +263 77 106 3710: Noted sir
06/03/24, 11:37 am - +263 77 106 3710: Thank you
06/03/24, 12:23 pm - Shubham Madhwal: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $100 within the next 30 days.*
06/03/24, 12:34 pm - +263 77 106 3710: Okay ,that is fine
06/03/24, 12:35 pm - Shubham Madhwal: <Media omitted>

06/03/24, 12:43 pm - Shubham Madhwal: As you can see, we are currently at Step 1. After this step, you will proceed to Step 2. If you successfully pass Step 2, you will receive your Acceptance Letter from the Edoofa Academic Board in Step 3. After that, as shown in the image above, the completion of your Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4.

Upon completing your formalities, in Step 5: we will initiate your Edoofa Admission Process and your Earn While You Learn Program. We will assign your complete application to our Admission Officers and the Head Coach of the Earn While You Learn Program.

The Admission Officers will be responsible for assisting you with all the required admission documentation that we discussed earlier, including the Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendation, and the completion of applications in all of Edoofa’s Associated Universities, etc.

The Head Coach will be responsible for assigning your application to the Earn While You Learn Program Mentor, who will then evaluate your candidature and assist with projects and assignments throughout your journey with the Edoofa Program.
06/03/24, 12:43 pm - Shubham Madhwal: As an organization that has positively impacted the lives of tens of thousands of African students, we understand that over 97% of parents face financial challenges when planning for their child’s tertiary education. In fact, it is one of the most prominent fears because of which there are parents who despite understanding the kind of growth their child would get through international education, still opt for their children to study in their home country.

Now in our quest to overcome this challenge, I would like to inform you that in Stage 5, while our Admission officers assist with all the necessary admission-related documentation, Edoofa’s Financial Planning team will connect with your parents to help them plan finances for your higher education.

Since in the majority of African nations inflation is a real challenge, keeping in mind that the cost of living in your home country increases atleast by 20% year on year, Financial Planning officers will be responsible for helping your parents plan for your tertiary education in a way that ensures they are not burdened financially throughout your education. Financial planning would include the following aspects:-
*Budgeting for your higher education, as per your parent's affordability.*
*Supporting your parents in building your tertiary education fund.*
06/03/24, 12:44 pm - Shubham Madhwal: I hope you now have an in-depth understanding of what happens in Stage 5 of your Edoofa Cycle?

06/03/24, 1:26 pm - Shubham Madhwal: In Step 6: Once the Financial Planning Team assists your parents in budgeting for your higher education, moving forward you will receive offer letters from the universities where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to complete the required registration process,  as well as finalizing the University. *In order to reserve your seat in any particular University chosen by you a registration fee would have to be paid which would be adjusted through your budgeting done in Stage 5 of the Edoofa Cycle.*

*NOTE:- The registration fee adjusted is not an additional cost, rather it is a part of your first year’s annual fee*
06/03/24, 1:26 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *After a few weeks of your registration process, you will be given your Final Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL), which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
06/03/24, 1:26 pm - Shubham Madhwal: So now would you like to ask anything?
06/03/24, 1:35 pm - +263 77 360 0071: Yes when are we supposed to pay the registration fees
06/03/24, 1:36 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Please that is once you get selected for the university

06/03/24, 3:12 pm - +263 77 106 3710: Yes

After receiving your offer letter from the University, you will have to pay your registration fee in order to finalise your university selection and reserve your scholarship seat in a particular university, this registration fee will be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?
07/03/24, 12:06 pm - +263 77 106 3710: 1. Bachelor of Business Administration.

6.It is a programme whereby students will be working whilist they are learning .They get paid in the form of scholarship credits .The money will pay for their school fees.The salary is not in the form of cash ,some will be working on projects which are related to their course or not .Others will be doing communication skills ,creative skills etc .So to those students who work efficiently will be compansated more .It is an advantage to the students who are more serious with their work because  their school fees will be reduced .             

7. No ,the registration fee is not a part of the first year 's annual fee .The registration fee is on it,s own .
07/03/24, 3:15 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *@263771063710* Please note that the number of scholarship seats is limited in number, and in case *Nyasha* is selected for the scholarship we expect that you are clear and aware of all the details shared during the session along with that you also obey the rules and honour the scholarship terms.  

In case you do not follow these terms then *Nyasha’s* entire scholarship process will go into backlog and you will only be able to apply for the scholarship after 6 months. By then the entire fee structure for the scholarship program may increase*.
07/03/24, 3:16 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Ideally, as you know, the tentative dates are:
1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the *14th or 15th of March 2024* for $200 and the *14th or 15th of April 2024* for the remaining $150.

2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the *14th or 15th of March 2024*
