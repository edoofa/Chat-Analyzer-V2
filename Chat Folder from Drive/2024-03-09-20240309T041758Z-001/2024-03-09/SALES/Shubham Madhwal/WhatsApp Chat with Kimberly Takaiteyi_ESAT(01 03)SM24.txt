07/03/24, 8:59 am - Shubham Madhwal: Good morning!  let's draw inspiration from the timeless wisdom found in the Bible:

*"As the scriptures teach, knowledge is a steadfast companion. A person enlightened by wisdom is held in high regard across all realms. The brilliance of education surpasses the allure of beauty and the vigor of youth."*

May our journey of learning be guided by the profound teachings that echo through the ages. With positive energy, let's continue our interactive session and embrace the transformative power of education.
07/03/24, 9:09 am - +263 77 405 8961: Thank you very much for the inspiration, we will continue working hard until fulfilment of set goals

07/03/24, 9:44 am - +263 77 296 3786: It's unfortunate the student is at school and will be available during school holidays
07/03/24, 9:46 am - +263 77 296 3786: As the parents we greatly inspired with your work
07/03/24, 9:55 am - Shubham Madhwal: Glad to hear that please, In that case the parents can also take part in the session on behalf of the student, So are you available for the same?

07/03/24, 9:59 am - +263 77 296 3786: If you may shade more light about Edoofa, we only heard about the scholarships
07/03/24, 10:33 am - Shubham Madhwal: Okay so, as we start discussing your results further, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 


Qualification to the ESAT Exam (Please note EDOOFA calculates your results based on the TOP performers' Score so it is the percentile that we will be evaluating on)
A Level and Previous Results 
*Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 
*Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these Four  significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
07/03/24, 11:01 am - +263 77 296 3786: Yes I am prepared, I will try my best to meet the significant metrics
07/03/24, 11:13 am - Shubham Madhwal: Please excuse me for the interruption, but I have an important meeting scheduled with the Academic Board to discuss your application. I'll be away momentarily, but I'll inform you as soon as I return. Thank you for your understanding.

Till then please take care.
