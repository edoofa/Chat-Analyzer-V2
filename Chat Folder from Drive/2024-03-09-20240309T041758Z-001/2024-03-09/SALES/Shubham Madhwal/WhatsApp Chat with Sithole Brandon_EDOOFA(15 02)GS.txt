19/02/24, 11:13 pm - Gurvinder: Hi Dear, I hope you are doing well.

I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons that I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship. 

I hope to get a positive response from you soon.
19/02/24, 11:15 pm - +263 77 319 7231: Good evening sorry l was out of range .Was in Gweru where there was no network .please consider me
20/02/24, 9:17 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning Everyone,
Hope you are doing well,
Please come online so that we can continue with the session.
20/02/24, 10:24 am - +263 77 319 7231: Here I am!
20/02/24, 10:24 am - +263 77 319 7231: Hoe are
20/02/24, 10:25 am - +263 77 319 7231: I hope I find you well
20/02/24, 11:21 am - Gurvinder: That is great, let me brief you more.
20/02/24, 11:21 am - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
20/02/24, 11:21 am - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
20/02/24, 11:21 am - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
20/02/24, 11:21 am - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
20/02/24, 11:23 am - +263 77 319 7231: Noted, quite interesting
20/02/24, 11:24 am - +263 77 319 7231: Precisely
20/02/24, 11:26 am - +263 77 319 7231: The situation in Zimbabwe right now is quite tense and a future is uncertain. Financial hardships have caused problems in my education but I am looking for a platform to bounce back from and you are the top recommended help I could find
20/02/24, 11:26 am - +263 77 319 7231: Please, pass my thanks to the brilliant minds who are constantly supporting your program
20/02/24, 11:35 am - Gurvinder: Okay so Mrs Shonani, as we start your son's counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
20/02/24, 11:36 am - +263 77 319 7231: Yes
20/02/24, 11:36 am - +263 77 319 7231: I am dedicated to getting whatever needs to be done and we both will be willing participants
20/02/24, 12:04 pm - Gurvinder: Now Mrs Shonani, I would like to know Sithole better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about him, his career aspiration do include sharing about:-

1. His highest education level?
2. The course he would like to study?
3. What do you parents do?
4. What is the parent’s highest education level?
5. Who has been supporting him for his Education so far?
6. Who will be supporting him financially for his higher education abroad?
7. Does he have any siblings? if yes, what do they do?
8. May I know which school does he studies at and in which province is it located along with that how much was his per-term fee in A level?
20/02/24, 3:38 pm - +263 77 319 7231: Anopaishe Brandon Sithole is a young man aged 19, determined and focused in his studies. From a young age, he seemed smart and always has a hands-on approach. His love for sciences started at young age with homemade simple machines and joining the Science Fair Team at both primary and secondary levels. Even though he is not going to school at the moment, he occupies himself with Civil Engineering books and Mechanical experiments and projects. Academically gifted in the Science Department, he attended his Ordinary Level studies at Nkululeko High School where he was a border. He wrote nine subjects including Physics, Biology and Chemistry. He passed all nine subjects and this is his highest level of education. He did attempt to write A level at Denmak Training Services, choosing Pure Mathematics, Physics and Geography. He failed dismally, due to the pressures of being a day scholar and got only 3 points. Denmak Training Services is located in Harare Province and the fees per term was 320USD. Both parents are of working class. The father is a primary grade teacher at Kuwadzana 4 Primary School and mother is a Patrolwoman in Harare City Council. Mr. Sithole's highest level of education is a diploma in motor mechanics and Mrs. Shonani's is Ordinary Level passes. Both the father and mother have been actively supporting his education providing for his fees and his daily needs. The couple will also be responsible for his finances abroad. They will be responsible for his person during the period of his stay. He is the first born of two, his younger sister is now in Grade 7 at K.I.P College. A bounce back is possible for the boy, as he has shown determination and willingness to persue Civil Engineering.
20/02/24, 3:41 pm - Gurvinder: It is a pleasure to know Brandon, Mrs Shonani.
20/02/24, 3:41 pm - Gurvinder: So may I know, is he going to attempt his A-levels again or not?
20/02/24, 4:42 pm - +263 77 319 7231: Due to the current situation, I am not able to sponsor him again
20/02/24, 4:55 pm - +263 77 319 7231: Fincial restrictions have closed the opportunity
22/02/24, 5:51 am - +263 77 319 7231: Hello

23/02/24, 9:39 am - +263 71 945 9170: Yes sir
23/02/24, 9:42 am - +263 71 945 9170: At O level i had 9 subjects: 1 A in History, 5 B's in Mathematics, Geography, English, Shona and Combined Science and 3 C's in Physics, Chemistry and Biology. At A level I had 3 points: 2 points in Geography, 1 in Pure Mathematics and in Physics I had 0 points.
23/02/24, 9:44 am - +263 71 945 9170: The last exam I did write in Physics A level was disturbed due to health reasons. I think that contributed to my low grade.
23/02/24, 9:56 am - Gurvinder: Due to the fact that you have failed in Physics, I cannot offer you a degree course but I sure can offer you a diploma course.
23/02/24, 10:14 am - +263 71 945 9170: Okay okay

23/02/24, 10:35 am - +263 71 945 9170: I have tinkled in that area in Physics and I grown an attachment to designing and creating simple and complex structures. Am I to specialise after finishing the diploma?
23/02/24, 11:07 am - +263 71 945 9170: Thank you for the outlined details
23/02/24, 11:51 am - Gurvinder: Please you can do that after the course.
23/02/24, 11:51 am - Gurvinder: So did you understand the course?
23/02/24, 11:53 am - +263 71 945 9170: Okay
23/02/24, 11:53 am - +263 71 945 9170: Yes
23/02/24, 11:53 am - +263 71 945 9170: I now get it fully
23/02/24, 11:58 am - Gurvinder: Since you have understood the course properly can you now tell me in 150 to 200 words that if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself 5 years after the completion of this course and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
23/02/24, 12:42 pm - +263 71 945 9170: After a guranteed success in Civil Engineering, I aim to  endulge in Rural and Urban Town Planning. This is my first choice in specialization and will be the most appropriate futuristic career opportunity. Zimbabwe is a fast growing country with the recent SADC statistics indicating it's one of the fastest growing economies in the region. The subject is not new to me as I have encountered it in both Geography and Physics. Futuristic cases were always projects on how to built strong structures in Physics, and how to properly manage and direct a growing settlement in Geography. This indicates that Urban planners will be relevant and needed. Having aquired the necessary skills, I can easily be able to answer the call. Alternatively, I have an interest to major in Environmental Engineering. In both Secondary and High phases of my education, I joined the Environmental Management Clubs at my schools and devoted to reforming the harm caused by human activities to the Earth. This dedication was further strengthened by studying Geography. Having a little bit of knowledge from A Level, it is easier for me to quickly catch up. I have aquired such good skills as identifying, theoretical solutions, designing of experiments, construction of case scenarios and practical solutions analysis. Hence, my third option is also to be a structural engineer. A good Physics background checks out my case.  Your program's dedication to seeing bright minds succeed grants me comfort and affirms me that it is the best way to help me. By implementing your 'Learn As You Work' mantra, I will gain not only knowledge and theoretical skills, but also practical understanding and a hands-on training experience like no other. And through your continuous support I will further cement my educational knowledge and carve a clear way to my future.
23/02/24, 12:43 pm - Gurvinder: That is really great Brandon I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations,

However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

Are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way inorder to transform your career dear?
23/02/24, 12:46 pm - +263 71 945 9170: I am willing to sacrifice anything in order to see my dreams through. Certain financial restrictions have limited me thus far, but taking this breakthrough opportunity I am certain I will not miss again.
23/02/24, 12:46 pm - +263 71 945 9170: Even up to 2000%
23/02/24, 12:48 pm - Gurvinder: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
23/02/24, 12:52 pm - +263 71 945 9170: Although statistics say otherwise, job opportunities in this country are very low. I will then have to look for a civil engineering part time job, which also pay very little to the student. Sustainability will then be an issue during the tenure I will be at attachment.
23/02/24, 12:52 pm - +263 71 945 9170: However a slightly higher opportunity is found abroad preferable to our country
23/02/24, 12:53 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
23/02/24, 12:58 pm - +263 71 945 9170: Indeed. Maximum exposure to me is a must. Civil engineering is the scientific definition of human development and I will be crucial in the development of my community at minimum and country at maximum. Having Rural And Urban Town Planning skills, not only will I design settlements, but built educational institutions in many places in Zimbabwe
23/02/24, 1:04 pm - +263 71 945 9170: Also, I aim to build and fund for children homes. Education for those with disabilities seems undercooked. I aim to help it as much as I possibly can
23/02/24, 1:15 pm - Gurvinder: I appreciate your sense of hardworking for your community Brandon, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?
23/02/24, 1:21 pm - +263 71 945 9170: I do
23/02/24, 1:21 pm - Gurvinder: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
23/02/24, 1:21 pm - +263 71 945 9170: But I like think of myself as versitile, as long as I am working on becoming smarter and a better person
23/02/24, 1:23 pm - +263 71 945 9170: Yes, and many scholars have argued that. What scares me most is the difference in religion though.
23/02/24, 1:23 pm - Gurvinder: You see Edoofa’s vision to provide every student with an education that is not just affordable but accessible and employable as well can only be achieved by utilizing the infrastructure of Indian Education landscape that has been developed over the last 75+ years since India’s Independence.

23/02/24, 1:24 pm - +263 71 945 9170: Noted.
23/02/24, 1:24 pm - +263 71 945 9170: Interesting
23/02/24, 1:28 pm - +263 71 945 9170: Wow. Simply too much to take in. But I can see India is clearly establishing herself as a dominant superpower and I think she will provide me with the necessary skills to navigate my way to success.
23/02/24, 1:30 pm - Gurvinder: So now Brandon, I hope you must have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead. As of now would you like to ask anything so far?
23/02/24, 1:33 pm - +263 71 945 9170: Yes sir. How about the accomodations?
23/02/24, 1:34 pm - Gurvinder: Before that, by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India?
23/02/24, 1:35 pm - +263 77 319 7231: No sir!
23/02/24, 1:35 pm - +263 77 319 7231: We all have recently heard it
23/02/24, 1:50 pm - +263 71 945 9170: Nope
23/02/24, 1:56 pm - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
23/02/24, 1:56 pm - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
23/02/24, 1:56 pm - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
23/02/24, 1:57 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
23/02/24, 1:57 pm - Gurvinder: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*

*after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
23/02/24, 1:59 pm - +263 71 945 9170: Truly amazing
23/02/24, 1:59 pm - +263 71 945 9170: Even more is the Earn While You Learn Program
23/02/24, 2:02 pm - Gurvinder: So now shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?
23/02/24, 2:09 pm - +263 71 945 9170: If you can.... please do
23/02/24, 2:11 pm - Gurvinder: Brandon, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
23/02/24, 2:54 pm - +263 71 945 9170: Okay i get it
23/02/24, 2:54 pm - +263 71 945 9170: Is it available in my area of study?
23/02/24, 2:55 pm - Gurvinder: Yes, please.
23/02/24, 2:56 pm - Gurvinder: The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

*1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-_*Africa Global Radio*_ - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

-_*Skooqs*_ - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
23/02/24, 2:56 pm - Gurvinder: *2. Recruitment Partners: -*

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
23/02/24, 2:56 pm - Gurvinder: *3. Webinars: -*

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
_Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world_ by *Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade*.
_How to network like a boss_ by *Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi*

23/02/24, 2:56 pm - Gurvinder: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase. 

*What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
23/02/24, 3:01 pm - +263 71 945 9170: They really do provide such an exquisite and sustainable education system. By implementing it, not only will I visualize my future but work hand in hand with successful individuals to see me through the period.
23/02/24, 3:02 pm - +263 71 945 9170: I think to a greater extend, they will shape my future for the better
23/02/24, 3:03 pm - Gurvinder: I am delighted to hear that Brandon, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
23/02/24, 3:05 pm - +263 71 945 9170: Okay okay
23/02/24, 3:06 pm - +263 71 945 9170: That's very good indeed!
23/02/24, 3:06 pm - +263 71 945 9170: And very affordable
23/02/24, 3:06 pm - Gurvinder: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

23/02/24, 3:06 pm - Gurvinder: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
23/02/24, 3:23 pm - +263 71 945 9170: Precisely
23/02/24, 3:24 pm - +263 71 945 9170: You are the bull's eye in terms of international education and provide an early map and spark to my future career
23/02/24, 3:29 pm - Gurvinder: Alright Brandon, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
23/02/24, 3:29 pm - +263 71 945 9170: Yes
23/02/24, 3:29 pm - +263 71 945 9170: But I think now they are busy at work
23/02/24, 3:30 pm - +263 71 945 9170: It has been a helpful insight today
23/02/24, 3:31 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so may I know if you have discussed international education plans with them in depth?
23/02/24, 3:32 pm - +263 71 945 9170: I have told them of my plan to enroll with you and they have gladly agreed. We just hadn't discussed the financial budget which I will tell as soon as they get home
23/02/24, 3:32 pm - Gurvinder: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
23/02/24, 3:33 pm - +263 71 945 9170: I am ready.
23/02/24, 3:33 pm - Gurvinder: Brandon as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
23/02/24, 3:33 pm - +263 71 945 9170: However my network is bad
23/02/24, 3:34 pm - +263 71 945 9170: In the range of $1500 to $2250
23/02/24, 3:35 pm - Gurvinder: Exactly Brandon, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
23/02/24, 3:35 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
23/02/24, 3:36 pm - +263 71 945 9170: Is there a deadline
23/02/24, 3:36 pm - +263 71 945 9170: When am I to pay?
23/02/24, 3:37 pm - Gurvinder: I will explain, but first, Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
23/02/24, 3:37 pm - +263 71 945 9170: I strongly agree
23/02/24, 3:38 pm - Gurvinder: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
23/02/24, 3:38 pm - Gurvinder: You see Edoofa's exceptional program has opened up a world of opportunities for aspiring students, garnering thousands of applications on a daily basis. The Eligibility Evaluation process ensures that deserving candidates are granted the chance to participate in the program. *Once accepted, students are requested to pay a nominal Program Fee of $350 within 7 days of receiving their acceptance letter*, following which they commence with their admission process and the esteemed Earn While You Learn Program. Edoofa's mission to provide quality education and support to students is at the heart of this initiative, and we are honored to make a difference in the lives of deserving individuals through this program.
23/02/24, 3:38 pm - Gurvinder: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
23/02/24, 3:48 pm - +263 71 945 9170: Okay
23/02/24, 3:49 pm - +263 71 945 9170: And how will I know if I have qualified
23/02/24, 3:49 pm - +263 71 945 9170: I believe further instructions await me after acceptance?
23/02/24, 3:49 pm - Gurvinder: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.

Are you familiar with the Edoofa Cycle?
23/02/24, 3:50 pm - +263 71 945 9170: Okay, I will consult my parents further
23/02/24, 3:51 pm - +263 71 945 9170: Nope, but I am curious to know
23/02/24, 3:52 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
23/02/24, 3:53 pm - Gurvinder: Alright Brandon, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zimbabwe itself.
23/02/24, 3:53 pm - Gurvinder: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
23/02/24, 3:55 pm - +263 71 945 9170: I think we are on the same page
23/02/24, 3:56 pm - Gurvinder: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of the registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
23/02/24, 3:56 pm - Gurvinder: Basically, this registration fee will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August/September 2024 and the remaining in January next year 2025.
23/02/24, 3:56 pm - Gurvinder: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
23/02/24, 3:56 pm - Gurvinder: So now would you like to ask anything?
23/02/24, 3:57 pm - +263 71 945 9170: No I am quick learner. I understand everything.
23/02/24, 3:58 pm - +263 71 945 9170: How long will the entire 5 steps so that I may tell my parents to prepare for the most important step 6
23/02/24, 3:58 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check
23/02/24, 3:58 pm - Gurvinder: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
23/02/24, 3:58 pm - Gurvinder: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

This gives them a bright opportunity to earn money while having practical approaches to their area of learning. The money earned by the student can be used to pay off student tuitions and other basic needs. This therefor reduces the stress on parents for money to pay for education.

06/03/24, 8:53 am - +263 77 319 7231: Yes
06/03/24, 9:21 am - Shubham Madhwal: So are there any questions you would like to ask regarding the acceptance letter?
06/03/24, 9:23 am - +263 71 945 9170: Yes
06/03/24, 9:23 am - +263 71 945 9170: How to pay the amount
06/03/24, 9:25 am - Shubham Madhwal: Let me assist you with the details!
06/03/24, 9:25 am - Shubham Madhwal: Alright so, if you have gone through your Letter of Acceptance thoroughly, you must have seen, that there are two modes of fee payments mentioned:-

1. Direct Bank Transfer to our Parent Company's account
2. Deposit in our associate's account over there in Zimbabwe

May I know which mode according to you would be convenient, so that I can brief you in-depth about that particular mode?
06/03/24, 9:46 am - +263 71 945 9170: which one has less percentage transfer fees
06/03/24, 9:47 am - Shubham Madhwal: You see in the first mode, the Direct Bank Transfer Mode, the transfer charges which are to be borne by the parents of the student ranges between $100 to $120 which becomes quite high for a lot of parents considering the economic situation in Zimbabwe itself. So as not every student is in a position to cater for an additional $100 to $120 just as a transfer charge, the second mode was introduced, wherein, it is the Bank deposit in Mr. Maposa's Account.
06/03/24, 9:47 am - Shubham Madhwal: So as you can see in the letter there is a Bank deposit in, *Mr. Needmore Maposa of Chibuwe High School's* account as he is our Associated Partner there in Zimbabwe, *His daughter is studying in India through the Edoofa Program and from his school over 30 students are studying in India under the Edoofa Program.*
06/03/24, 9:48 am - Shubham Madhwal: The fee payment can also be made through Chibuwe High. School Principal himself. Since his account is a NOSTRO Account which only holds USD itself, therefore *the necessary amount including the transfer charges in this mode itself would be 12.5% of the fees you are paying* the same details are as below:-

BANK NAME: FBC

BRANCH: Mutare

ACC NAME: Maposa Needmore

06/03/24, 11:35 am - Shubham Madhwal: So let me further elaborate to you on the Edoofa Scholarship Program
Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000+ students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200+ schools with more than 250 Headmasters, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza, a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe who is also our associate and is the Ex-Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program.

She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program former students of St. David's Bonda which also happens to be our associate school, they are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, she would be the right person to help you clarify how the Edoofa scholarship program has assisted her and how it was possible for her to cater towards international education for both her children at the same time. Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
06/03/24, 3:07 pm - Shubham Madhwal: <Media omitted>
06/03/24, 3:08 pm - Shubham Madhwal: <Media omitted>
06/03/24, 3:08 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Today I would like you to connect with Mrs Ruth, To understand from a parent's perspective about the benefits of education through the Edoofa Scholarship Program and the type of opportunities, assistance and infrastructure we provide our students once they come to India.
06/03/24, 3:10 pm - +263 77 319 7231: Thanks very much l will conduct  her asap
06/03/24, 3:11 pm - +263 77 319 7231: Nice the children are enjoying
07/03/24, 8:50 am - Shubham Madhwal: Good morning!  let's draw inspiration from the timeless wisdom found in the Bible:

*"As the scriptures teach, knowledge is a steadfast companion. A person enlightened by wisdom is held in high regard across all realms. The brilliance of education surpasses the allure of beauty and the vigor of youth."*

May our journey of learning be guided by the profound teachings that echo through the ages. With positive energy, let's continue our interactive session and embrace the transformative power of education.
07/03/24, 8:51 am - +263 77 319 7231: Mrng mrng
07/03/24, 9:00 am - Shubham Madhwal: Hello @263773197231, How are you please?
07/03/24, 9:01 am - +263 77 319 7231: I'm GD how are you working out for the payment definitely l will make it
07/03/24, 9:04 am - Shubham Madhwal: I am doing great please
07/03/24, 9:04 am - Shubham Madhwal: So before proceeding with the session, are there any questions you would like to ask?
07/03/24, 9:23 am - +263 71 945 9170: How are you?
07/03/24, 9:28 am - +263 77 319 7231: Yes Visa will cost about how much
07/03/24, 9:33 am - +263 71 945 9170: Yes, how much might the visa cost
07/03/24, 9:38 am - Shubham Madhwal: If you understand the concept of international education finances that play a major role are not visa fees and flight tickets. The flight ticket is required a very limited number of times as the students don't travel that often. I don't mean to say that students can not go back to their country, they can definitely go back to enjoy the holidays. What I have personally seen is, the students do not travel that often.
So, considering the main finance which plays the most important role in international education is the annual fees. So, to reduce this annual fee, edoofa helps a student with the Earn While You Learn Program. This program provides the students with an opportunity to earn scholarship credits which in return help them to make their education more affordable.
07/03/24, 9:38 am - Shubham Madhwal: Visa fees and flight tickets are to be bought just a month before they plan to come to India. So, let's say the student wants to come to India in August 2024, This means that his family has to cover the Visa fee and the ticket in July 2024. If you understand the concept properly, till July 2024, the student will be working in the Earn While You Learn program and will be earning Scholarship credits. Now, with this opportunity, you can save a lot of money on the annual fee which in return helps you to make your flight ticket and the Visa fee affordable.
07/03/24, 9:40 am - +263 71 945 9170: Okay okay i get it
07/03/24, 9:42 am - +263 71 945 9170: But i think @263773197231 had a hard time grasping the concept
07/03/24, 9:48 am - Shubham Madhwal: Can you elaborate on your question?
07/03/24, 9:49 am - +263 71 945 9170: How much do the Visas cost?An estimate amount please?
07/03/24, 9:52 am - +263 77 319 7231: Yes yes as an grown up l want to prepare in advance and as a parent is my duty to fulfill my child's requirements .So want to start the savings  but as an fully employed person  all is well
07/03/24, 9:54 am - Shubham Madhwal: As mentioned to you already, the scholarship covers the tuition fees as you see, the Edoofa scholarship is basically the scholarship seats acquired from the universities for their good work in the past 14 years in the higher education space. So the travel costs will have to be covered by the student, But our admission team assist you in all the steps. So that you get the cheapest air travel tickets and also acquire the visa with ease.
The cost for both the visa and flight cost will be around $400-$600, But you need not worry about that yet as you will be coming to India in the month of July-August next year as per your preperations
07/03/24, 9:54 am - Shubham Madhwal: So you need not worry about the same, Have you ever wondered what is the cost of travel in Zimbabwe?
07/03/24, 10:06 am - +263 77 319 7231: Next year or this year July- August
07/03/24, 10:11 am - Shubham Madhwal: Please this @263773197231
07/03/24, 10:31 am - Shubham Madhwal: @263773197231 Please the Edoofa Program director wishes to connect with you over a video call session to further discuss Brandon's scholarship process ahead, So are you available for the same?

07/03/24, 3:18 pm - +263 71 945 9170: i hope all went well in your meeting
07/03/24, 3:32 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Yes please it did, So are there any questions you would like to ask before we proceed ahead with the session?
07/03/24, 3:45 pm - +263 77 319 7231: Ok ok good afternoon
07/03/24, 3:55 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Great, @263773197231 @263774149246 enrollment fee payment deadline is on the 12th of March, 2024, May I know the progress for the same so far and when would you be proceeding ahead with the formalities?

07/03/24, 4:18 pm - +263 77 414 9246: We will make payments in time
07/03/24, 4:21 pm - Shubham Madhwal: @263774149246 you see the only reason I was seeking an update from you was. since I am well aware that in Zimbabwe there are severe Network Issues in Zimbabwe in a lot of regions because of which the bank sometimes faces server issues so in the past there have been parents who had to miss their deadline because their fees couldn't be completed on the same day of the due date, Instead, it took additional 2-3 days which delayed the overall progress of their child's admission.
07/03/24, 4:21 pm - Shubham Madhwal: As your counsellor, I can only recommend you to try and complete the formalities a day or two prior to the deadline so that such issues are avoided and you as parents do not have to be stressed regarding the same!
07/03/24, 4:23 pm - +263 77 414 9246: I hear you clearly we have already set everything in motion for that and I can assure you that we will beat the deadline
07/03/24, 4:24 pm - Shubham Madhwal: That's great to hear, And as family have you discussed upon a date that you would be proceeding ahead?
07/03/24, 4:24 pm - Shubham Madhwal: So that I can communicate the same with the academic board and begin with Brandon's admission procedures
07/03/24, 4:25 pm - +263 77 414 9246: We will finalize it today coz we work in different places and as we speak I am on my way home
07/03/24, 4:26 pm - +263 77 414 9246: We will come to you once we come together and come up with the date and time for the payments
07/03/24, 4:28 pm - +263 77 414 9246: We will never want to miss this opportunity
