I am Mr Shubham, The Senior Acadmecian at Edoofa. 

I am here to discuss the application of Tashinga 

Welcome to the Edoofa Scholarship Counselling Session

Before we begin with the session, I would like to ask you, what prior understanding you have about the Edoofa Scholarship Program
06/03/24, 1:04 pm - +263 77 688 9073: Unfortunately I don't know anything
06/03/24, 1:05 pm - +263 77 688 9073: I only know that its a platform that provides scholarships
06/03/24, 1:39 pm - Shubham Madhwal: So let me further elaborate to you on the Edoofa Scholarship Program
Edoofa Scholarship Program is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4500 students from different countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability is driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!
06/03/24, 1:39 pm - Shubham Madhwal: You know we have been helping students from the African nations and the SAARC countries for the past 6 years and in the short span of 6 years, the most common feedback which we hear from the students is how the Edoofa Program makes the higher education affordable through the financial aid and how it helps the students to make a financial plan to make sure that their dream of higher education abroad is fulfilled.
06/03/24, 1:39 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Basically, our motive is that by providing the SEELS (Students of Edoofa Earning and Learning to Success) initiative, we help our students in Planning and Giving them opportunities through which they can help themselves by self-sponsoring their higher education at the least annual Fee Possible.
06/03/24, 1:43 pm - +263 77 688 9073: Ok
06/03/24, 1:44 pm - +263 77 688 9073: I now have a general idea
06/03/24, 1:45 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000+ students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200+ schools with more than 250 Headmasters, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza, a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe who is also our associate and is the Ex-Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
06/03/24, 1:45 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High*, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s,*Shalom Academy*, Christ Ministries, *Advent Hope Academy*, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.

07/03/24, 8:57 am - Shubham Madhwal: Good morning!  let's draw inspiration from the timeless wisdom found in the Bible:

*"As the scriptures teach, knowledge is a steadfast companion. A person enlightened by wisdom is held in high regard across all realms. The brilliance of education surpasses the allure of beauty and the vigor of youth."*

May our journey of learning be guided by the profound teachings that echo through the ages. With positive energy, let's continue our interactive session and embrace the transformative power of education.
07/03/24, 9:08 am - +263 77 688 9073: Amen
07/03/24, 9:40 am - Shubham Madhwal: Can you also share a bit about the current/previous school you are studying at, How studying at that school helped you in becoming an overall better person, and what all activities did you participated in your school for your holistic growth?
07/03/24, 10:02 am - +263 77 688 9073: Well l studied at St Patrick's high school, located 38km outside gweru. It is an Anglican school and fortunately for me l was privileged to live at a monastery with Anglican nuns and brothers who taught me the essence of daily prayers and meditation as well as devotion to God. At St Patrick's high school, church is mandatory for everyone, so every Sunday and Wednesday morning, people went to church for communion and also every weekday after lessons, we went to a church service called evensong for 30 minutes to 1hour,this helped me to build a prayerful nature
07/03/24, 10:17 am - Shubham Madhwal: Great answers to both questions, This will help me to guide you better during the course of our Counselling!

I see you are interested in pursuing a course related to Social Worker, Can you please explain in detail what motivates you to pursue this career field?
07/03/24, 10:19 am - +263 77 688 9073: Well, one of the nuns who l lived with is a social worker, l felt captivated by her job and how she interacts with many people of different backgrounds. I felt like I wanted to do the same and help others the way she does
07/03/24, 10:34 am - Shubham Madhwal: Great, So I would now like you to share with me your previous qualification results i.e the picture of results for O-Level and Form-5
07/03/24, 10:38 am - +263 77 688 9073: <Media omitted>
07/03/24, 10:38 am - +263 77 688 9073: <Media omitted>
07/03/24, 11:05 am - Shubham Madhwal: Duly noted Tashinga
Please, So why have you not considered opting for Law?
07/03/24, 11:06 am - +263 77 688 9073: I don't feel passionate about law the same way l feel for social but l would take as a second option though
07/03/24, 11:08 am - Shubham Madhwal: It's fantastic to hear about your passion for Social Work and your desire to bring about positive change in society. The field of Social Work indeed provides a strong foundation for making a meaningful impact on individuals and communities facing various challenges. I'd like to share with you how pursuing a degree in Law can also align with your goals and contribute to the positive transformation you're seeking.
07/03/24, 11:08 am - Shubham Madhwal: In both Social Work and Law, the emphasis lies on addressing social issues, promoting justice, and advocating for those who need support. Social Work equips individuals to work directly with people in diverse settings, while Law provides a broader perspective on addressing societal issues through legal frameworks and systemic change.
07/03/24, 11:08 am - Shubham Madhwal: Just like in Social Work, a legal education exposes you to a range of critical issues such as discrimination, inequality, and social justice. As a lawyer, you have the power to influence policy, challenge systemic barriers, and advocate for those who may not have a voice. The legal profession offers opportunities to work in areas that align with your passion, such as human rights, public interest law, or social justice advocacy.
07/03/24, 11:08 am - Shubham Madhwal: Moreover, legal professionals often collaborate with social workers to address complex issues comprehensively. For example, in cases involving child welfare, mental health, or community development, a multidisciplinary approach involving both legal and social work expertise can lead to more effective and lasting solutions.
07/03/24, 11:08 am - Shubham Madhwal: By combining your dedication to social change with a legal education, you can broaden your impact and contribute to positive transformations on both individual and systemic levels. You'll gain skills in legal analysis, advocacy, and policymaking that complement the strengths acquired through a Social Work degree. This dual perspective can be a powerful asset as you work towards creating a more just and equitable society.
07/03/24, 11:12 am - +263 77 688 9073: Ok l see what you are getting at, law truly is a way to help others as an advocate but l just pefer social work, but if need be, l might consider law as a second option
07/03/24, 11:13 am - Shubham Madhwal: Please excuse me for the interruption, but I have an important meeting scheduled with the Academic Board to discuss your application. I'll be away momentarily, but I'll inform you as soon as I return. Thank you for your understanding.
07/03/24, 11:13 am - +263 77 688 9073: Ok, thank you sir
07/03/24, 3:21 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Hello,

07/03/24, 5:39 pm - +263 77 688 9073: Yes

Till then please take care.

*NOTE- My Working timings are from 7:30 AM to 4:30 PM CAT*
08/03/24, 9:54 am - Shubham Madhwal: Good morning! let's draw inspiration from the timeless wisdom found in the Bible:

 *Proverbs 3:6*

*"Seek His guidance in all you do, and He will show you the path to take. Embrace education with a heart full of reverence."*

Let's continue our interactive session and embrace the transformative power of education
