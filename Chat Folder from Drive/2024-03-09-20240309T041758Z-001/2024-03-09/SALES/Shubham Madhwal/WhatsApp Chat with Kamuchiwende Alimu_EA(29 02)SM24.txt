Edoofa Scholarship Program is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4500 students from different countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability is driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!
29/02/24, 11:34 am - Shubham Madhwal: You know we have been helping students from the African nations and the SAARC countries for the past 6 years and in the short span of 6 years, the most common feedback which we hear from the students is how the Edoofa Program makes the higher education affordable through the financial aid and how it helps the students to make a financial plan to make sure that their dream of higher education abroad is fulfilled.
29/02/24, 11:34 am - Shubham Madhwal: Basically, our motive is that by providing the SEELS (Students of Edoofa Earning and Learning to Success) initiative, we help our students in Planning and Giving them opportunities through which they can help themselves by self-sponsoring their higher education at the least annual Fee Possible.

04/03/24, 8:55 am - +263 78 110 5743: Okey.... let me say something about my previous school then . Previously before Chinhoyi 2 High , l was at Parkinson Secondary where l did my O Level which was one of the best schools in Shurugwi (midlands) Parkinson was headed by Mr Gombingo. The teachers there were very good and they used to monitor me closely so that l would remain on the right lane which contributed to my betterness  and also there was a guidance and counselling group where we were taught good morals and values which l used to panel beat  my life and became a well mannered and respectful person l am  today . At Parkinson when l was a form two kid l was made a prefect then eventually became the headgirl of my school because l was believed to be motivating and a good example who had good influences on others  when l was in form four. Besides the leadership part , l was also a good chess player from form one and the highest level l reached in terms of chess competitions was the national level .
04/03/24, 9:11 am - Shubham Madhwal: So you shared that your aunt assist's you for your higher education, Have you told her that you have applied for the Edoofa Program?
04/03/24, 9:12 am - +263 78 110 5743: Yes
05/03/24, 10:01 am - Shubham Madhwal: Good Morning,

*“If there is no struggle, there is no progress.” —Frederick Douglass*

On a positive note, I am here to begin our session
Are you ready?
05/03/24, 10:06 am - +263 78 110 5743: Morning morning
05/03/24, 10:06 am - +263 78 110 5743: I am in
05/03/24, 10:36 am - Shubham Madhwal: So before proceeding with the session, are there any questions you would like to ask?
05/03/24, 11:27 am - +263 78 110 5743: Okey  , let's say l have acquired the scholarship what are the requirements
05/03/24, 11:28 am - Shubham Madhwal: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it
05/03/24, 11:30 am - +263 78 110 5743: Yes sure
05/03/24, 11:39 am - Shubham Madhwal: Great answers to both questions, This will help me to guide you better during the course of our Counselling!

05/03/24, 11:45 am - +263 78 110 5743: Okey sure
05/03/24, 4:28 pm - Shubham Madhwal: <Media omitted>

06/03/24, 8:03 am - Shubham Madhwal: Good Morning Everyone, 

*"The beautiful thing about learning is that nobody can take it away from you. ―B.B. King."*

*When you step into this day realize that you have immense opportunities! All you need to do is give your best to grab it.*

With all positive energy, I am here to continue our interactive session.
06/03/24, 8:45 am - +263 78 110 5743: Am in
06/03/24, 8:52 am - Shubham Madhwal: So before proceeding with the session, are there any questions you would like to ask?
06/03/24, 9:14 am - +263 78 110 5743: No questions
06/03/24, 9:23 am - Shubham Madhwal: Please why did you not answer the question Ii shared with you yesterday?
06/03/24, 9:30 am - +263 78 110 5743: Oooh sorry so l was thinking that l answered it already
06/03/24, 9:30 am - +263 78 110 5743: Let me answer it quickly my apologies sir
06/03/24, 9:55 am - Shubham Madhwal: Duly noted,  I am waiting for your response!
06/03/24, 10:30 am - +263 78 110 5743: There quite a lot of factors which motivates me to persue this career field . 
My O Level geography teacher was someone who motivated me the most both directly and indirectly . The way he taught us always gave me passion towards knowing more about geology and how the earth goes . Another thing on him that motivated me was the way he was proud of the subject he taught he felt proud of knowing all those kinds of interesting things on earth ,how it began how the earth ended up being the way it is today and also how the rocks form . His consistent talk about this grew this bold passion towards being a geologist because l always said to myself that one day l want to study these rocks get to know their nature and dig deeper into this interesting  geology thing . I have that passion of being able to predict how minerals occur on a certain place and how they are distributed l want to know how to predict the time duration the minerals will be still available in a certain are .
It is also said that by studying rocks , fossils, and landforms geologists can piece together the story of how our planet has evolved over millions of years so l would also want to see that for myself because this deep time perspective not only provides insight into the past but also helps us better understand the present and anticipate the future implications of geological phenomena . 
Another motivating factor for me is the interdisciplinary nature of geology. As a geologist l would have the opportunity to collaborate with scientists from various fields including physics ,chemistry , biology and environmental science.
06/03/24, 10:33 am - Shubham Madhwal: So In Which year will you appear for your A-Level examination?
06/03/24, 10:34 am - +263 78 110 5743: This year in November

However, as your concierge, I would like to share with you that the career path which you have chosen ahead, will require a lot of hard work and dedication.

So are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way in order to transform your career?
07/03/24, 11:13 am - Shubham Madhwal: Please excuse me for the interruption, but I have an important meeting scheduled with the Academic Board to discuss your application. I'll be away momentarily, but I'll inform you as soon as I return. Thank you for your understanding.

07/03/24, 3:18 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Hello,
I am back from the meeting,
Shall we now continue with our session?
07/03/24, 3:29 pm - +260 773409336: Good afternoon I think now she is in her extra lessons she will be online when she is done
07/03/24, 3:35 pm - Shubham Madhwal: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it
07/03/24, 3:37 pm - +260 773409336: Okay

Till then please take care.

Have a good day ahead. 
God Bless You!
