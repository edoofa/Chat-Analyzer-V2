*I am Mr Gurvinder Singh, Senior Career Counselor at Edoofa*

We have received an application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program from your friend and our student.

I hope I have contacted the right person.

I would like you to come online so that I could discuss with you the form you submitted online and what I was able to understand from the same!

You can address me as Mr Gurvinder, we do have Mr Piiyush, Head of Counselling and  Mr Jyotishman, Head of Admissions who will be evaluating your responses for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
29/01/24, 11:39 am - +263 77 816 9258: Thank you Mr Gurvinder.You may go ahead Sir .
29/01/24, 12:05 pm - Gurvinder: Alright, so Mr Taderera, I can see you got to know about the Edoofa Program from Tadiwanashe, is that correct?
29/01/24, 12:07 pm - +263 77 816 9258: Yes
29/01/24, 12:44 pm - Gurvinder: Okay, so can you tell me what all did you learn about the Edoofa Program from Tadiwanashe, also do tell me whether you learnt about Tadiwanashe’s Journey and Experience with the Edoofa Program?
29/01/24, 12:59 pm - +263 77 816 9258: My daughter who has applied for this programme unfortunately did not have sufficient time to interact with Tadiwanashe about the program since her phone developed fault and in the process she lost Tadiwanashe contacts .

I kindly ask for your favour to briefly elaborate to me about the program.From Tadiwanashe's journey and experience with the Edoofa program ,it sounds it is a genuine programme that aims to 
uplift the standards of learners from poor background in Africa .
29/01/24, 1:24 pm - Gurvinder: Noted.
29/01/24, 1:24 pm - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
29/01/24, 1:24 pm - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
29/01/24, 1:24 pm - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
29/01/24, 1:24 pm - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
29/01/24, 1:28 pm - +263 77 816 9258: Yes it is true indeed .I will be glad to be presented with such an opportunity in life.
29/01/24, 1:37 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so Mr Taderera, as we start your counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
29/01/24, 1:40 pm - +263 77 816 9258: Thank you for this information about many other students who are associated with EDOOFA  and this gives me hope and zeal to encourage my daughter and other eligible students to be part of this program.I would glad if my daughter is remembered in this program.

For my brief background ,l am employed in the Ministry of Primary and Secondary Education as a Schools Inspector Infant Department .I was the head of schools before I was elevated to this position .I am stationed at Zvimba District in Mashonaland Province .I supervise 200 hundred schools both primary and secondary ones .

My highest qualification is Masters Degree in Early Childhood Development .

I am now looking for sponsorship to carry out Doctorate program.

Thank you once more again for taking your time to chart with me about EDOOFA Program.
29/01/24, 1:42 pm - +263 77 816 9258: Yes indeed considering my professional status as an educationist ,this will not be a problem.

30/01/24, 9:26 am - Gurvinder: So now I want to appreciate your sense of hardworking for your community Mr Taderera as a Schools Inspector Infant Department, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?
30/01/24, 9:30 am - +263 77 816 9258: Yes I agree with you 100%.
30/01/24, 9:31 am - Gurvinder: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
30/01/24, 9:32 am - +263 77 816 9258: Sure
30/01/24, 9:33 am - Gurvinder: You see Edoofa’s vision to provide every student with an education that is not just affordable but accessible and employable as well can only be achieved by utilizing the infrastructure of Indian Education landscape that has been developed over the last 75+ years since India’s Independence.

30/01/24, 9:42 am - Gurvinder: Please I wish that too, So now Mr Tarderera, I hope you must have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead. As of now would you like to ask anything so far?
30/01/24, 9:49 am - +263 77 816 9258: So far am now more convinced that EDOOFA. Program is real and is the way to go .As a school Inspector who interacts with many  students in schools in Zvimba ,would I become an EDOOFA Ambassador in preaching this good news about EDOOFA ,introducing many more legible students to you .

And from here what is the way forward about my daughter Kudakwashe .
30/01/24, 9:54 am - Gurvinder: Mr Tarderera, becoming an ambassador is very well an option for you, I would personally put in a recommendation for that with the program director and you can discuss that further when we schedule a call for you with him.
30/01/24, 9:54 am - +263 77 816 9258: On another note ,my daughter sent me a response saying BCA course is good and opts for it .
30/01/24, 9:59 am - Gurvinder: That is great.
30/01/24, 9:59 am - Gurvinder: So now moving ahead by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India?
30/01/24, 10:33 am - +263 77 816 9258: Thank you I take note .
30/01/24, 10:33 am - +263 77 816 9258: No idea so far .
30/01/24, 12:09 pm - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
30/01/24, 12:09 pm - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
30/01/24, 12:09 pm - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
30/01/24, 12:09 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
30/01/24, 12:09 pm - Gurvinder: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*

*after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
30/01/24, 1:21 pm - +263 77 816 9258: Ok well explained .
30/01/24, 1:25 pm - Gurvinder: So now shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?
30/01/24, 5:03 pm - +263 77 816 9258: Yes Sir you may go ahead .Sorry today I was out on schools inspection so I faced network challenges .
30/01/24, 11:28 pm - Gurvinder: Dear, I was expecting your response in the counseling session, but you could not get back to me due to some reason so I am about to finish my second counseling slot for the day, I will have to schedule your session for *Tomorrow at 10 am CAT*. 

Please note that I have two counseling slots in a day which are during my working hours from *7:30 am to 4:30 pm CAT Monday to Friday*, so to complete your application you would have to be present during that time. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning. Therefore I would like you to be online at the above-mentioned time for a smooth conversation.
31/01/24, 5:21 am - +263 77 816 9258: Noted with thanks .
01/02/24, 7:55 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

*“Strive not to be a success, but rather to be of value”*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
01/02/24, 8:01 am - +263 77 816 9258: Good morning Sir .Thank you for words of encouragement .
01/02/24, 8:43 am - Gurvinder: So shall I continue with this?
01/02/24, 8:52 am - +263 77 816 9258: Yes Sir go ahead
01/02/24, 8:53 am - Gurvinder: Mr Taderera, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
01/02/24, 9:04 am - +263 77 816 9258: This is fantastic and awesome .Thank you for this information .I appreciate this program.
01/02/24, 9:08 am - Gurvinder: The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it.

01/02/24, 9:08 am - Gurvinder: *2. Recruitment Partners: -*

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
01/02/24, 9:08 am - Gurvinder: *3. Webinars: -*

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
_Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world_ by *Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade*.

01/02/24, 9:09 am - Gurvinder: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase. 

*What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit your child?*
01/02/24, 9:14 am - +263 77 816 9258: Very very useful indeed .This can assist her extra ordinarily .
01/02/24, 9:15 am - Gurvinder: I am delighted to hear that Mr Taderera, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
01/02/24, 9:45 am - +263 77 816 9258: Very Great. I did not know that the world cares for Africa like this .
01/02/24, 9:53 am - Gurvinder: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

01/02/24, 9:53 am - Gurvinder: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
01/02/24, 9:57 am - +263 77 816 9258: EDOORE Program is a unique program I have never come across and hear about .I have really learned a lot and wish my daughter the best shall you consider her .
01/02/24, 9:58 am - Gurvinder: Alright Mr Taderera, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe you and your family members would be the ones who would be supporting your child for her higher education.
01/02/24, 10:40 am - +263 77 816 9258: Yes Sir .
01/02/24, 10:40 am - Gurvinder: Okay so may I know if you have discussed international education plans with them in depth?
01/02/24, 10:44 am - +263 77 816 9258: They are in this platform the mother and my daughter and at home we discuss this together .The daughter is happy about everything you have been sharing in this platform
01/02/24, 11:42 am - Gurvinder: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
01/02/24, 11:58 am - +263 77 816 9258: Yes go ahead please
01/02/24, 12:00 pm - Gurvinder: Mr Taderera as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
01/02/24, 12:10 pm - +263 77 816 9258: Yes it would be a huge task considering the source of income parents get .
01/02/24, 12:15 pm - Gurvinder: Can you please ask in figures?
01/02/24, 12:44 pm - +263 77 816 9258: I did not get you ,what does the question require me to explain.
01/02/24, 12:46 pm - Gurvinder: *If the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
01/02/24, 1:21 pm - +263 77 816 9258: $ 2250
01/02/24, 1:25 pm - Gurvinder: Exactly Mr Taderera, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
01/02/24, 1:25 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
01/02/24, 1:39 pm - +263 77 816 9258: Yes this is much more better and affordable .
01/02/24, 1:40 pm - Gurvinder: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
01/02/24, 1:42 pm - +263 77 816 9258: Very very laudable indeed .
01/02/24, 1:43 pm - Gurvinder: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
01/02/24, 1:43 pm - Gurvinder: Mr Taderera basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
01/02/24, 1:43 pm - Gurvinder: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
01/02/24, 1:46 pm - +263 77 816 9258: Ok ,quite pleasing .
01/02/24, 1:48 pm - Gurvinder: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.

Are you familiar with the Edoofa Cycle?
01/02/24, 1:49 pm - +263 77 816 9258: Not yet familiar .
01/02/24, 1:52 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
01/02/24, 1:53 pm - Gurvinder: Alright Mr Taderera, as you can see, we are currently at Step 1. After this step, you will proceed to Step 2. If you successfully pass Step 2, you will receive your Acceptance Letter from the Edoofa Academic Board in Step 3. After that, as shown in the image above, the completion of your Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4.

Upon completing your formalities, in Step 5: we will initiate your Edoofa Admission Process and your Earn While You Learn Program. We will assign your complete application to our Admission Officers and the Head Coach of the Earn While You Learn Program.

The Admission Officers will be responsible for assisting you with all the required admission documentation that we discussed earlier, including the Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendation, and the completion of applications in all of Edoofa’s Associated Universities, etc.

The Head Coach will be responsible for assigning your application to the Earn While You Learn Program Mentor, who will then evaluate your candidature and assist with projects and assignments throughout your journey with the Edoofa Program.
01/02/24, 1:53 pm - Gurvinder: As an organization that has positively impacted the lives of tens of thousands of African students, we understand that over 97% of parents face financial challenges when planning for their child’s tertiary education. In fact, it is one of the most prominent fears because of which there are parents who despite understanding the kind of growth their child would get through international education, still opt for their children to study in their home country.

Now in our quest to overcome this challenge, I would like to inform you that in Stage 5, while our Admission officers assist with all the necessary admission-related documentation, Edoofa’s Financial Planning team will connect with your parents to help them plan finances for your higher education.

Since in the majority of African nations inflation is a real challenge, keeping in mind that the cost of living in your home country increases atleast by 20% year on year, Financial Planning officers will be responsible for helping your parents plan for your tertiary education in a way that ensures they are not burdened financially throughout your education. Financial planning would include the following aspects:-
*Budgeting for your higher education, as per your parent's affordability.*
*Supporting your parents in building your tertiary education fund.*
01/02/24, 1:54 pm - Gurvinder: I hope you now have an in-depth understanding of what happens in Stage 5 of your Edoofa Cycle?
01/02/24, 2:00 pm - +263 77 816 9258: Yes ,I have understood it.
01/02/24, 2:03 pm - Gurvinder: In Step 6: Once the Financial Planning Team assists your parents in budgeting for your higher education, moving forward you will receive offer letters from the universities where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to complete the required registration process,  as well as finalizing the University. *In order to reserve your seat in any particular University chosen by you a registration fee would have to be paid which would be adjusted through your budgeting done in Stage 5 of the Edoofa Cycle.*

*NOTE:- The registration fee adjusted is not an additional cost, rather it is a part of your first year’s annual fee*
01/02/24, 2:03 pm - Gurvinder: *After a few weeks of your registration process, you will be given your Final Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL), which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
01/02/24, 2:03 pm - Gurvinder: So now would you like to ask anything?
01/02/24, 2:13 pm - +263 77 816 9258: Yes in my case my daughter is completing A level this year 2024 and would want to enroll her first degree outside the country and by God's Grace probably with EDOOFA Program.My question when would you expect her to make payments .
01/02/24, 2:15 pm - Gurvinder: Please right now, you only have to worry about the enrollment fee, which is to be paid in 7 days after your daughter is found eligible for the program.
01/02/24, 2:43 pm - +263 77 816 9258: When would this enrolment process expected to begin so that we get prepared for 7 days window period for payments .
01/02/24, 2:49 pm - Gurvinder: Please that would start from tomorrow onwards.
01/02/24, 2:56 pm - +263 77 816 9258: Ok I will let you know when am ready for this .
01/02/24, 2:56 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check
01/02/24, 2:56 pm - Gurvinder: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
01/02/24, 2:56 pm - Gurvinder: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

SECTION 2 READING TEST

Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage.
If a person suddenly encounters any terrible danger, the change of nature one undergoes is equally great. Sometimes fear numbs our senses. Like animals, one stands still, powerless to move a step in fright or to lift a hand in defense of our lives, and sometimes one is seized with panic, and again, act more like the inferior animals than rational beings. On the other hand, frequently in cases of sudden extreme peril, which cannot be escaped by flight, and must be instantly faced, even the most timid men at once as if by miracle, become possessed of the necessary courage, sharp quick apprehension and swift decision. This is a miracle very common in nature. Man and the inferior animals alike, when confronted with almost certain death ‘ gather resolution from despair’ but there can really be no trace of so debilitating a feeling in the person fighting, or prepare
d to fight for dear life. At such times the mind is clearer than it has ever been; the nerves are steel, there is nothing felt but a wonderful strength and daring. Looking back at certain perilous moments in my own life, I remember them with a kind of joy, not that there was any joyful excitement then, but because they broadened my horizon, lifted me for a time above myself.

Whey to Go Greek yogurt—a strained form of cultured yogurt—has grown enormously in popularity in the United States since it was first introduced in the country in the late 1980s. From 2011 to 2012 alone, sales of Greek yogurt in the US increased by 50 percent. The resulting increase in Greek yogurt production has forced those involved in the business to address the detrimental effects that the yogurt-making process may be having on the environment. Fortunately, farmers and others in the Greek yogurt business have found many methods of controlling and eliminating most environmental threats. Given these solutions as well as the many health benefits of the food, the advantages of Greek yogurt Q5. outdo the potential drawbacks of its production.Sentence [1] The main environmental problem caused by the production of Greek yogurt is the creation of acid whey as a by-product.Sentence [2] Because it requires up to four times more milk to make than conventional yogurt does, Greek yogurt produces larger amounts of acid whey, which is difficult to dispose of.Sentence [3] To address the problem of disposal, farmers have found a number of uses for acid whey. Sentence[4] They can add it to livestock feed as a protein Q.6. supplement and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt. Sentence[5] If it is improperly introduced into the environment, acid-whey runoff Q.7. can pollute waterways, depleting the oxygen content of streams and rivers as it decomposes. Sentence [6] Yogurt manufacturers, food Q.8. scientists; and government officials are also working together to develop additional solutions for reusing whey.

A wise man once said, every action has its own concequences which can either be negative or positive, but what is important is how you deal with the outcome. Today's story is about how Rwanda survived its most horrific event of genocide starting from the 7th of April to the 15th of July 1994 during the Rwandan Civil War between the Hutus and the Tutsis and they are still surviving 16 years later

16 years later following the Rwandan genocide, survivors and their families have continued to present with considerable rates of PTSD and substantial depressive and anxiety symptoms. This is revealing a strong association between health problems and psychosocial factors such as social integration. However despite these, Rwandan women stepped forward by taking in opharned children and organized support groups for widows. Women moved from cleaning to reconstruction. They farmed and started businesses which created stability in the after math of unspeakable violence. This improved the social life of Rwandan people.

Born in the years since the genocide, children were being educated in schools that were  strongly encouraging desistation from using potentially divisive labels. Pupils were discouraged from identifying themselves as Hutu or Tusti and instead focus on building the future of a common Rwanda. This promoted peace and stability upto now.

The genocide also affected the economy of the country, but Rwanda's drive to rebuild its economy since then has been successful. It's has now became one of the most developed country in Africa. It was able to export its raw materials like tea and coffee as well as foreign aid which played a vital role in the development of the country even until now. Unemployment rates and enflation decreased as well as poverty upto now.

Since the genocide, the government adopted a policy of open return and reconciliation. The government also made sure that there was no distinction between its two main ethnic groups, the Hutus and Tutsis. This promoted harmony even upto now. They also banned enthic identity cards which promoted national unity. They made sure that Rwanda's densely populated territories are tightly controlled and monitored. Therefore public safety became high with rare incidents of violence

So the lesson l learnt from this tragedy is that silence and indifference in the face of such horrific crimes only enbolders the killers and make even worse crimes possible, putting innocent lives at the crossfire. After all violence is never the solution to problems.
23/02/24, 11:39 pm - +263 71 695 6964: SECTION 6: my inspirational story

Life is not a bad of roses but rathera time of tribulation, self discovery, tragedies, regrets, challenges and also happiness. What is important is the person you become after going through these. The question is, do you become the better version of yourself or a disaster of yourself and those around you.

Am an 18 year old girl who yet to experience what l mentioned above and also already faced some of them. Am still striving to be a better version of myself, to be a woman of value and virtue. To be a somebody one day.   

Growing up in this 20th century has become harder as time goes by. It's all now about wanting to fit in forgeting yourself and your purpose in life. And l should say am proud of myself for resisting this peer pressure as am now in my final year in high school without drug abusing, teenage pregnancy etc as this has become a normality in our century. I hope to be somebody's role model one day if l ain't one already.

One thing life has taught me is, you must stand your ground, be your own person and do what you know is the best for you. Greater things in life require hardwork. Be careful of the company you keep around your self and l was fortunate enough to have parents and friends who helps me to become a better person.

06/03/24, 10:14 am - Shubham Madhwal: Glad to hear that please, So are there any questions you would like to ask regarding the acceptance letter?
06/03/24, 10:16 am - +263 77 816 9258: Not now but will ask letter
06/03/24, 10:17 am - Shubham Madhwal: Duly noted please, So what is the enrollment fees payment deadline mentioned in the Edoofa Acceptance letter?
06/03/24, 10:20 am - +263 77 816 9258: 12 March 2024 and
06/03/24, 10:20 am - Shubham Madhwal: Yes please, And are you aware of the transaction methods as well please?
06/03/24, 1:25 pm - Shubham Madhwal: @263778169258 Please why are you not participating, is there any issue you are facing?
06/03/24, 1:26 pm - +263 77 816 9258: Yes i was travelling but am now back in my Office .Lets talk.
06/03/24, 1:27 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Duly noted please!
06/03/24, 1:29 pm - +263 77 816 9258: The transaction method  has been well explained on the acceptance note.We are going to deposit the money using Mr Maposa Needmore's bank FBC account .
06/03/24, 1:31 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Alright so, if you have gone through your Letter of Acceptance thoroughly, you must have seen, that there are two modes of fee payments mentioned:-

1. Direct Bank Transfer to our Parent Company's account
2. Deposit in our associate's account over there in Zimbabwe

May I know which mode according to you would be convenient, so that I can brief you in-depth about that particular mode?
06/03/24, 1:33 pm - +263 77 816 9258: The second option is better for us
06/03/24, 1:35 pm - Shubham Madhwal: You see in the first mode, the Direct Bank Transfer Mode, the transfer charges which are to be borne by the parents of the student ranges between $100 to $120 which becomes quite high for a lot of parents considering the economic situation in Zimbabwe itself. So as not every student is in a position to cater for an additional $100 to $120 just as a transfer charge, the second mode was introduced, wherein, it is the Bank deposit in Mr. Maposa's Account.
06/03/24, 1:35 pm - Shubham Madhwal: So as you can see in the letter there is a Bank deposit in, *Mr. Needmore Maposa of Chibuwe High School's* account as he is our Associated Partner there in Zimbabwe, *His daughter is studying in India through the Edoofa Program and from his school over 30 students are studying in India under the Edoofa Program.*
06/03/24, 1:35 pm - Shubham Madhwal: The fee payment can also be made through Chibuwe High. School Principal himself. Since his account is a NOSTRO Account which only holds USD itself, therefore *the necessary amount including the transfer charges in this mode itself would be 12.5% of the fees you are paying* the same details are as below:-

BANK NAME: FBC

BRANCH: Mutare

ACC NAME: Maposa Needmore

06/03/24, 1:43 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *You can also see that the First Lady of Zimbabwe, and the Ambassador of the Zimbabwean embassy acknowledge the program.*
06/03/24, 1:49 pm - +263 77 816 9258: Thanks Sir because our teachers need more evidence of genuiness for Edoofa scholarship progrmmes for them to believe .Through pics and testimonies ,through vedeos and stories they quickly believe .Most of them want to send their children abroad coz in Zimbabwe ,sending a child to a local university is uncertainity these days .
06/03/24, 1:49 pm - +263 77 816 9258: Good
06/03/24, 1:50 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Yes Please, I Understand I will definitely share the same with them as we proceed!
06/03/24, 1:53 pm - +263 77 816 9258: Thank you Sir.Am encouraged by your professional interactive approach .Keep it up Sir.
06/03/24, 2:00 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Thank you for the kind words please
06/03/24, 2:03 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Mr Taderea, I have a request for you, Please do not share the details I share here in the counselling groups, Directly in the other groups that you have created, As the flow of conversation through which I am trying to share the details in the group breaks, Hence it becomes a bit tough for me to get back to the point I was sharing earlier, I hope you understand?
06/03/24, 2:08 pm - +263 77 816 9258: Ok Sir ,Am pushed by the unsefishness passion to spread the good news to as many people as i can but now that you have advised me not to ,i will faithfully slow down.I have understood you Sir.
06/03/24, 2:11 pm - Shubham Madhwal: I really appreciate your effort and enthusiasm through which you are supporting this program, And I am really grateful for the same, Later on, I will personally share certain details that I would ask you to post on our behalf as well as seeing your passion to help the people
06/03/24, 2:15 pm - +263 77 816 9258: I professionally  recognise this request .Thank you Sir Shubham.
06/03/24, 2:17 pm - Shubham Madhwal: So are there any other questions you would like to ask?
06/03/24, 2:23 pm - +263 77 816 9258: I just wanted to know what is the next action after we have paid acceptance fees .I want also clarification on the meaning of ( 60-100%) score .
06/03/24, 2:27 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Please the next action after the enrollment fees are paid, will be that our team will guide you through the admissions process with various university along with that the Earn While you Learn program will also commence for Kudakwashe
06/03/24, 2:28 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Mr Taderera @263778169258. As you may recall from the counselling session, Mr Gurvinder informed you that the cost of education after the Edoofa Scholarship is approximately $2000-$3000. *However, with my special recommendation, as indicated, Kudakwashe was considered for a higher quantum of scholarship. Therefore, the effective annual fee after the scholarship would be even lower, in the range of ($1200-$1800), as mentioned in the acceptance letter.*
06/03/24, 2:28 pm - Shubham Madhwal: This consideration was made primarily during the evaluation process, as I recognized *Kudakwashe 's* potential. I firmly believe that if students like her are provided with the right resources at the right time in their careers, they have the potential to become great future leaders. Hence, I made a special recommendation to the Edoofa Academic Board.
06/03/24, 2:49 pm - +263 77 816 9258: Thank you Sir
06/03/24, 2:50 pm - +263 77 816 9258: Ok i understand.Thank you for the effort you made .
06/03/24, 2:51 pm - Shubham Madhwal: So are there any other questions you would like to ask?
06/03/24, 2:54 pm - +263 77 816 9258: I will come back to you once i do have other grey areas to iron out so far so good.
06/03/24, 2:54 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Duly noted please
06/03/24, 3:02 pm - Shubham Madhwal: So Mr Taderera, Did you manage to connect with Mrs Ruth?
06/03/24, 4:00 pm - +263 77 816 9258: Not yet i tasked my wife to do that ,so i hope she managed to get in touch with her .I will know it when i go home after work.
06/03/24, 4:06 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Duly noted please!
07/03/24, 8:50 am - Shubham Madhwal: Good morning!  let's draw inspiration from the timeless wisdom found in the Bible:

*"As the scriptures teach, knowledge is a steadfast companion. A person enlightened by wisdom is held in high regard across all realms. The brilliance of education surpasses the allure of beauty and the vigor of youth."*

May our journey of learning be guided by the profound teachings that echo through the ages. With positive energy, let's continue our interactive session and embrace the transformative power of education.

07/03/24, 10:08 am - +263 77 816 9258: Thank you Sir .
07/03/24, 10:11 am - Shubham Madhwal: So before proceeding with the session, are there any questions you would like to ask?
07/03/24, 10:17 am - +263 77 816 9258: Yes ,i want to know a few things in connection to Kudakwashe' s journey to Edoofa scholarship programme.

Now that ,we would have paid the fees required ,briefly highlight to us when exactly is she going to be enrolled at the University ,and in terms of preparation for the programme ,what other issues would need more financial attention.Or how much can we raise from now until the time she would be offered a place .
07/03/24, 10:19 am - Shubham Madhwal: Please the university selection process commences within 2-3 weeks after enrollment itself!
07/03/24, 10:20 am - Shubham Madhwal: After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities.
07/03/24, 10:37 am - +263 77 816 9258: Ok we will be making a follow up and wait to be guided .
07/03/24, 11:13 am - Shubham Madhwal: Please excuse me for the interruption, but I have an important meeting scheduled with the Academic Board to discuss your application. I'll be away momentarily, but I'll inform you as soon as I return. Thank you for your understanding.
07/03/24, 12:03 pm - +263 77 816 9258: Thank you Sir,you may be excused.
07/03/24, 3:14 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Hello,
I am back from the meeting,
Shall we now continue with our session?
07/03/24, 3:58 pm - +263 77 816 9258: Good afternoon Sir.I welcome you back .Yes lets continue .
07/03/24, 4:17 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Great, @263778169258, Kudakwashe's enrollment fee payment deadline is on the 12th of March, 2024, May I know the progress for the same so far and when would you be proceeding ahead with the formalities?
07/03/24, 4:20 pm - +263 77 816 9258: Money is available .We are going to get in touch with Chibuwe Head so that we deposit the money before Tuesday.
07/03/24, 4:21 pm - Shubham Madhwal: @263778169258 you see the only reason I was seeking an update from you was. since I am well aware that in Zimbabwe there are severe Network Issues in Zimbabwe in a lot of regions because of which the bank sometimes faces server issues so in the past there have been parents who had to miss their deadline because their fees couldn't be completed on the same day of the due date, Instead, it took additional 2-3 days which delayed the overall progress of their child's admission.
07/03/24, 4:21 pm - Shubham Madhwal: As your counsellor, I can only recommend you to try and complete the formalities a day or two prior to the deadline so that such issues are avoided and you as parents do not have to be stressed regarding the same!
07/03/24, 4:21 pm - Shubham Madhwal: So if I may ask so far do you need my help with anything, please?
07/03/24, 4:26 pm - +263 77 816 9258: Maybe if you may get in touch with that Chibuwe Head so that he is aware of the deposit i will do tomorrow or saturday.
07/03/24, 4:36 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Please, you can surely connect with him about the same, Incase you are unable to then, you can complete the formalities and share with me the transaction slip, Our accounts will then get it confirmed on your behalf!
07/03/24, 4:43 pm - +263 77 816 9258: Thank you will do that .
07/03/24, 4:47 pm - Shubham Madhwal: so are there any other questions you would like to ask?
07/03/24, 4:52 pm - +263 77 816 9258: Not now so far so good unless you have something very vital that you think is necessary for me to know.
07/03/24, 9:10 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Duly noted please
07/03/24, 9:17 pm - Shubham Madhwal: I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I will connect with you *tomorrow again at 09:00 AM CAT* to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care.

Have a good day ahead. 
God Bless You!

07/03/24, 9:27 pm - +263 77 816 9258: Duly noted Sir.Good night .
08/03/24, 8:33 am - Shubham Madhwal: Good morning! let's draw inspiration from the timeless wisdom found in the Bible:
