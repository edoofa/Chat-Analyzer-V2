29/02/24, 9:33 am - Gurvinder: It is a pleasure to connect with you today Bridget, Mr and Mrs Nyika!,

You can address me as Mr Gurvinder, we do have Mr Shubham, Senior Academician, and  Mr Jyotishman, Head of Admissions who will be evaluating your responses for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
29/02/24, 9:34 am - +263 77 381 4143: My pleasure too
29/02/24, 9:36 am - +263 77 481 9660: My pleasure too to connect with you all
29/02/24, 9:55 am - Gurvinder: Alright, so Bridget, I can see you got to know about the Edoofa Program from Nokutenda, is that correct?
29/02/24, 9:57 am - +263 77 481 9660: Yes
29/02/24, 9:59 am - +263 77 481 9660: Actually she came to our school telling us about EDOOFA and I was interested to join  program
29/02/24, 10:05 am - Gurvinder: Okay, so can you tell me what all did you learn about the Edoofa Program from Nokutenda, also do tell me whether you learnt about Nokutenda’s Journey and Experience with the Edoofa Program?
29/02/24, 10:15 am - +263 77 481 9660: Unfortunately I couldn't get a time to hear from her journey and experience but I hope soon I'll meet her so that I can get to know her better
29/02/24, 10:16 am - Gurvinder: Noted, let me brief you about the program myself.
29/02/24, 10:16 am - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
29/02/24, 10:16 am - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
29/02/24, 10:17 am - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
29/02/24, 10:17 am - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
29/02/24, 10:17 am - +263 77 481 9660: When she came to our school she also mentioned the Earn as you learn program which I now fully understand as it was well explain On the day I wrote my ESAT exam
29/02/24, 10:22 am - Gurvinder: So did you get a chance to talk to one of the counsellor after that?
29/02/24, 10:28 am - +263 77 481 9660: I heard as if they were saying counseling is attended when you have a parent of which I was alone
29/02/24, 10:31 am - Gurvinder: Noted.
29/02/24, 10:31 am - Gurvinder: So can you please address this.
29/02/24, 10:39 am - +263 77 481 9660: Yes sir .... Also I had the passion to study abroad but my family status limited it
29/02/24, 10:48 am - Gurvinder: Okay so Bridget, as we start your counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
29/02/24, 10:52 am - +263 77 481 9660: Yes I think I'll meet every metric
29/02/24, 10:57 am - Gurvinder: Now Bridget, I would like to know you better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about yourself, your career aspiration do include sharing about:-

1. Your highest education level?
2. The course you would like to study?
3. What do your parents do?
4. What is your parent’s highest education level?
5. Who has been supporting you for your Education so far?
6. Who will be supporting you financially for your higher education abroad?
7. Do you have any siblings? if yes, what do they do?
8. May I know which school do you study at and in which province is it located along with that how much was your per-term fee in A level?

Please elaborate on your answers and answer them in points, so that I can understand your application more briefly and assist you in a better way
29/02/24, 11:20 am - +263 77 481 9660: -I wrote my o level exams in 2022 and passed all my 10 OLevel  subjects currently in Upper 6

29/02/24, 12:32 pm - +263 77 481 9660: I heard no plan that I always wished for a program like EDOOFA since I wanted to just go and study abroad maybe there will be greener pastures that I will be able to change my family's and community's lifestyle
29/02/24, 12:36 pm - Gurvinder: I would like to share with you that the cost of education after the scholarship still comes down to $2000-3000, do you think your parents can support you for that?
29/02/24, 12:40 pm - +263 77 481 9660: No ,
29/02/24, 12:44 pm - +263 77 481 9660: They won't be able to support me with all of the money since my father is the only one who works for the whole family of us while his job is not that well paying <This message was edited>
29/02/24, 12:53 pm - Gurvinder: Noted, so you don't want to continue?
29/02/24, 12:58 pm - +263 77 481 9660: I want to continue with EDOOFA
29/02/24, 12:59 pm - +263 77 481 9660: Is the amount for an anum or per semester

29/02/24, 3:12 pm - +263 77 381 4143: <Media omitted>
29/02/24, 3:16 pm - Gurvinder: Bridget basically we offer Aerospace Engineering, And you are eligible for the same too,  but the universities which offer these course have to invest a lot in the infrastructure and the practical education as well, so even after the scholarship the cost will be higher as compared to the rest of the Engineering courses <This message was edited>
29/02/24, 3:16 pm - Gurvinder: Choosing B.Tech Mechanical Engineering over Aerospace Engineering offers broader career prospects. Mechanical Engineering provides a versatile skill set applicable across industries, including aerospace. It opens doors to various sectors such as automotive, energy, and manufacturing, offering a diverse range of opportunities. This versatility enhances employability, providing a solid foundation for a successful career in engineering.
29/02/24, 3:16 pm - Gurvinder: https://worldscholarshipforum.com/aerospace-engineering-vs-mechanical-engineering/
29/02/24, 3:29 pm - +263 77 481 9660: This was my passion can you give an estimate for the fees
29/02/24, 3:35 pm - Gurvinder: Please, after the scholarship, the cost can reach up to $2700-3700 per year.
29/02/24, 5:06 pm - +263 77 481 9660: Okay Sir I now understand that mechanical engineering has  broader prospects also. I'd choose it it's a nice program though
29/02/24, 11:19 pm - Gurvinder: Well Dear, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you tomorrow again at 10AM CAT to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care.

Have a good day ahead. 
God Bless You!
01/03/24, 8:20 am - +263 77 481 9660: Good morning Mr Gurvinder
01/03/24, 8:21 am - +263 77 481 9660: thank you I'll be waiting for you
02/03/24, 9:52 am - Gurvinder: Good morning, everyone!

I hope this message finds you well.

I request everyone to come online so that we can continue with our session.
02/03/24, 9:58 am - +263 77 286 6990: Morning sir , how are you .
02/03/24, 10:01 am - +263 77 381 4143: Mrng sir how are you
02/03/24, 10:01 am - +263 77 481 9660: Morning sir how are you
02/03/24, 10:28 am - Gurvinder: I am fine, how are you?
02/03/24, 10:30 am - +263 77 286 6990: I'm fine
02/03/24, 10:31 am - +263 77 381 4143: Fine
02/03/24, 10:38 am - +263 77 481 9660: I am okay
02/03/24, 11:15 am - Gurvinder: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.
02/03/24, 11:21 am - +263 77 481 9660: Okay but these minimum passes doesn't they limit programs
02/03/24, 11:27 am - Gurvinder: Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.
02/03/24, 11:31 am - +263 77 481 9660: Yes , I'm very confident about achieving them
02/03/24, 11:32 am - +263 77 381 4143: She has the potential to achieve best results
02/03/24, 1:06 pm - Gurvinder: Shall I brief you about the course?
02/03/24, 1:06 pm - +263 77 381 4143: Yes
02/03/24, 1:30 pm - Gurvinder: *B.Tech. Mechanical Engineering* is a 4-year undergraduate course

First thing any engineering aspirant considers while choosing a branch in Engineering is placement aspect and the course very well caters to it. A few questions which arise when admissions to engineering colleges commence include the branch in demand, highest paid engineering graduates and others such.  Apart from this palcement criteria, there are some other parameters which should be considered while choosing a discipline like- what are the research opportunities, what is scope of career growth etc.

Mechanical Engineering is the evergreen branch of engineering. Market scenario and demand of engineering graduates change every year but the demand of mechanical engineering degree will never be obsolete. Mechanical engineering graduates can find placements in almost every sector, right from construction sector to steel industry and from automobile to software.

Following are the sub disciplines that are associated with mechanical engineering:

*Production Engineering*
*Industrial Engineering*
*Manufacturing Engineering*
*Automobile Engineering*
*Artificial Intelligence*

The field of mechanical engineering can be thought of as a collection of many mechanical engineering science disciplines. Several of these subdisciplines which are typically taught at the undergraduate level are listed below, with a brief explanation and the most common application of each. Some of these subdisciplines are unique to mechanical engineering, while others are a combination of mechanical engineering and one or more other disciplines. Most work that a mechanical engineer does uses skills and techniques from several of these subdisciplines, as well as specialized subdisciplines. Specialized subdisciplines, as used in this article, are more likely to be the subject of graduate studies or on-the-job training than undergraduate research. Several specialized sub disciplines are discussed in this section.

*Mechanics* 

Mechanics is, in the most general sense, the study of forces and their effect upon matter. Typically, engineering mechanics is used to analyze and predict the acceleration and deformation (both elastic and plastic) of objects under known forces (also called loads) or stresses. Subdisciplines of mechanics include Statics, the study of non-moving bodies under known loads, how forces affect static bodies Dynamics the study of how forces affect moving bodies. Dynamics includes kinematics (about movement, velocity, and acceleration) and kinetics (about forces and resulting accelerations). Mechanics of materials, the study of how different materials deform under various types of stress Fluid mechanics, the study of how fluids react to forces Kinematics, the study of the motion of bodies (objects) and systems (groups of objects), while ignoring the forces that cause the motion. Kinematics is often used in the design and analysis of mechanisms. Continuum mechanics, a method of applying mechanics that assumes that objects are continuous (rather than discrete) Mechanical engineers typically use mechanics in the design or analysis phases of engineering. If the engineering project were the design of a vehicle, statics might be employed to design the frame of the vehicle, in order to evaluate where the stresses will be most intense. Dynamics might be used when designing the car's engine, to evaluate the forces in the pistons and cams as the engine cycles. Mechanics of materials might be used to choose appropriate materials for the frame and engine. Fluid mechanics might be used to design a ventilation system for the vehicle (see HVAC), or to design the intake system for the engine

*Mechatronics and Robotics*

Mechatronics is a combination of mechanics and electronics. It is an interdisciplinary branch of mechanical engineering, electrical engineering and software engineering that is concerned with integrating electrical and mechanical engineering to create hybrid systems. In this way, machines can be automated through the use of electric motors, servo-mechanisms, and other electrical systems in conjunction with special software. A common example of a mechatronics system is a CD-ROM drive. Mechanical systems open and close the drive, spin the CD and move the laser, while an optical system reads the data on the CD and converts it to bits. Integrated software controls the process and communicates the contents of the CD to the computer.

Robotics is the application of mechatronics to create robots, which are often used in industry to perform tasks that are dangerous, unpleasant, or repetitive. These robots may be of any shape and size, but all are preprogrammed and interact physically with the world. To create a robot, an engineer typically employs kinematics (to determine the robot's range of motion) and mechanics (to determine the stresses within the robot).

Robots are used extensively in industrial engineering. They allow businesses to save money on labor, perform tasks that are either too dangerous or too precise for humans to perform them economically, and to ensure better quality. Many companies employ assembly lines of robots, especially in Automotive Industries and some factories are so robotized that they can run by themselves. Outside the factory, robots have been employed in bomb disposal, space exploration, and many other fields. Robots are also sold for various residential applications, from recreation to domestic applications.

*Thermodynamics and Thermo-science*

Thermodynamics is an applied science used in several branches of engineering, including mechanical and chemical engineering. At its simplest, thermodynamics is the study of energy, its use and transformation through a system. Typically, engineering thermodynamics is concerned with changing energy from one form to another. As an example, automotive engines convert chemical energy (enthalpy) from the fuel into heat, and then into mechanical work that eventually turns the wheels.

Thermodynamics principles are used by mechanical engineers in the fields of heat transfer, thermofluids, and energy conversion. Mechanical engineers use thermo-science to design engines and power plants, heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems, heat exchangers, heat sinks, radiators, refrigeration, insulation, and others.

*Design and drafting*

Drafting or technical drawing is the means by which mechanical engineers design products and create instructions for manufacturing parts. A technical drawing can be a computer model or hand-drawn schematic showing all the dimensions necessary to manufacture a part, as well as assembly notes, a list of required materials, and other pertinent information. A U.S. mechanical engineer or skilled worker who creates technical drawings may be referred to as a drafter or draftsman. Drafting has historically been a two-dimensional process, but computer-aided design (CAD) programs now allow the designer to create in three dimensions.

Instructions for manufacturing a part must be fed to the necessary machinery, either manually, through programmed instructions, or through the use of a computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) or combined CAD/CAM program. Optionally, an engineer may also manually manufacture a part using the technical drawings. However, with the advent of computer numerically controlled (CNC) manufacturing, parts can now be fabricated without the need for constant technician input. Manually manufactured parts generally consist of spray coatings, surface finishes, and other processes that cannot economically or practically be done by a machine.

Drafting is used in nearly every subdiscipline of mechanical engineering, and by many other branches of engineering and architecture. Three-dimensional models created using CAD software are also commonly used in finite element analysis (FEA) and computational fluid dynamics (CFD).

I'm planning to come back after the course so as to develop my community also implementing the skills I had acquired from Indians and EDOOFA family both professional and ethical skills. 
I'm looking forward to specialise in robotics and have my own robotics company in Zimbabwe hope that I'll be the first start robotics .I'll empower the girl child all over the world telling them that only the sky is the limit for all your expectations  also no one should set boundaries for you.

Also I see it as my opportunity to prove my existence with all the potential I have and to shine brighter than ever .

03/03/24, 2:36 pm - Gurvinder: That is really great Bridget I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations,

However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

Are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way inorder to transform your career dear?
03/03/24, 2:42 pm - +263 77 481 9660: Yes I'm very willing to give 10 times the hardworking you are expecting as long as it is pushing me to my dream
03/03/24, 2:43 pm - Gurvinder: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
03/03/24, 2:49 pm - +263 77 481 9660: Gaining international experience in both business and socialism .Even experiencing cultural diverse and learning different languages
03/03/24, 2:52 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
03/03/24, 3:01 pm - +263 77 481 9660: I think I will do something like funding some events to educate those in need or even starting a NGO to support those who are underprivileged to help them archive their goals education wise
04/03/24, 9:51 am - Gurvinder: Good morning, everyone!

I hope this message finds you well.

04/03/24, 10:07 am - Gurvinder: I appreciate your sense of hardworking for your community Bridget, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?
04/03/24, 10:07 am - +263 77 381 4143: Mrng sir
04/03/24, 10:08 am - +263 77 481 9660: Yes I agree
04/03/24, 10:12 am - Gurvinder: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
04/03/24, 10:25 am - +263 77 481 9660: Yes
04/03/24, 10:25 am - Gurvinder: You see Edoofa’s vision to provide every student with an education that is not just affordable but accessible and employable as well can only be achieved by utilizing the infrastructure of Indian Education landscape that has been developed over the last 75+ years since India’s Independence.
04/03/24, 10:25 am - Gurvinder: *Following are the reasons as to Why Edoofa Focuses on India for Scholarships: A Quick Look!*

04/03/24, 1:33 pm - Gurvinder: So now Bridget, I hope you must have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead. As of now would you like to ask anything so far?
04/03/24, 1:40 pm - +263 77 481 9660: Nothing so far
04/03/24, 1:43 pm - Gurvinder: I appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country. In this process did you make any prior research on foreign education or applied to any University abroad?
04/03/24, 4:17 pm - +263 77 481 9660: No I haven't done anything so far except for EDOOFA
05/03/24, 9:01 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning Everyone,
I would like to inform you that, you have been inactive throughout the counselling session, I would like you to complete your counselling session today or I would have to close your application.
05/03/24, 9:03 am - +263 77 381 4143: Good morning sir .maybe for now she is in lesson let me try to call her

05/03/24, 9:25 am - Gurvinder: Noted.
05/03/24, 9:25 am - Gurvinder: So now moving ahead by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India?
05/03/24, 9:32 am - +263 77 381 4143: We are not aware
05/03/24, 9:33 am - +263 77 481 9660: They're are not aware
05/03/24, 9:39 am - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
05/03/24, 9:39 am - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
05/03/24, 9:39 am - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
05/03/24, 9:39 am - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
05/03/24, 9:39 am - Gurvinder: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*

*after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
05/03/24, 9:44 am - +263 77 381 4143: Now i understand this great opportunity.i wish my daughter will be the one
05/03/24, 9:46 am - Gurvinder: So now shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?
05/03/24, 9:47 am - +263 77 286 6990: Yes sir go ahead
05/03/24, 9:48 am - +263 77 381 4143: Yes sir. may you explain
05/03/24, 9:53 am - Gurvinder: @263774819660 @263772866990 , The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
05/03/24, 10:02 am - +263 77 381 4143: This programe is the best sir .I wish Bridget will get an opportunity in this EWYL for her to achieve her best goals without financial challenges
05/03/24, 10:03 am - Gurvinder: The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

*1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-_*Africa Global Radio*_ - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

-_*Skooqs*_ - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
05/03/24, 10:04 am - Gurvinder: *2. Recruitment Partners: -*

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
05/03/24, 10:04 am - Gurvinder: *3. Webinars: -*

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
_Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world_ by *Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade*.
_How to network like a boss_ by *Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi*

05/03/24, 10:04 am - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
05/03/24, 10:04 am - Gurvinder: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase. 

*What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
05/03/24, 10:11 am - +263 77 481 9660: As much as EWYL program is implemented the cost can come down to which amounts or is there a scenario that it will pay all the amount
05/03/24, 10:15 am - Gurvinder: Can you please address this I will explain that to you ahead.
05/03/24, 10:18 am - +263 77 481 9660: This will really benefit me 
This is because it is very affordable as far as how my parents earn also will give me a chance to excel
05/03/24, 10:21 am - Gurvinder: I am delighted to hear that Bridget, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
05/03/24, 10:34 am - +263 77 481 9660: Okay now I understand thank you sir
05/03/24, 10:38 am - Gurvinder: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

05/03/24, 10:48 am - +263 77 481 9660: It's a very good program I see
05/03/24, 11:39 am - Gurvinder: Alright Bridget, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
05/03/24, 11:42 am - +263 77 381 4143: Yes we are responsible for that
05/03/24, 11:47 am - Gurvinder: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
05/03/24, 11:48 am - +263 77 481 9660: Yes I'm ready
05/03/24, 11:48 am - +263 77 381 4143: I'm ready
05/03/24, 11:52 am - +263 77 286 6990: I'm ready
05/03/24, 12:22 pm - Gurvinder: Bridget as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
05/03/24, 12:27 pm - +263 77 481 9660: $1500-$2250
05/03/24, 12:31 pm - Gurvinder: Exactly Bridget, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
05/03/24, 12:32 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
05/03/24, 12:38 pm - +263 77 381 4143: At least it's affordable
05/03/24, 12:39 pm - Gurvinder: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
05/03/24, 1:03 pm - +263 77 286 6990: I think it's a positive step in assisting us as parents
05/03/24, 1:04 pm - Gurvinder: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
05/03/24, 1:04 pm - Gurvinder: You see Edoofa's exceptional program has opened up a world of opportunities for aspiring students, garnering thousands of applications on a daily basis. The Eligibility Evaluation process ensures that deserving candidates are granted the chance to participate in the program. *Once accepted, students are requested to pay a nominal Program Fee of $350 within 7 days of receiving their acceptance letter*, following which they commence with their admission process and the esteemed Earn While You Learn Program. Edoofa's mission to provide quality education and support to students is at the heart of this initiative, and we are honored to make a difference in the lives of deserving individuals through this program.
05/03/24, 1:04 pm - Gurvinder: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
05/03/24, 1:08 pm - +263 77 481 9660: Okay
05/03/24, 1:08 pm - Gurvinder: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.

Are you familiar with the Edoofa Cycle?
05/03/24, 1:09 pm - +263 77 286 6990: Not familiar
05/03/24, 1:11 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
05/03/24, 1:11 pm - Gurvinder: Alright Bridget, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zimbabwe itself.
05/03/24, 1:12 pm - Gurvinder: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
05/03/24, 1:43 pm - +263 77 481 9660: Yes , meaning this is the first step
05/03/24, 1:43 pm - Gurvinder: Yes.
05/03/24, 1:44 pm - Gurvinder: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of the registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
05/03/24, 1:44 pm - Gurvinder: Basically, this registration fee will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*.

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

06/03/24, 12:50 pm - +263 77 381 4143: Afternoon sir

So are there any questions that you or your family would like to ask regarding the program details?
06/03/24, 2:06 pm - +263 77 286 6990: Afternoon sir, i don't have any question, but I'm inspired by the program
06/03/24, 2:07 pm - +263 77 381 4143: After finishing her course is there any chance to get the job there in India <This message was edited>
06/03/24, 2:09 pm - Gurvinder: @263773814143 in the final year of the course every student in the University gets multiple chances of securing a good job within India itself as all the Universities have Employment Partners which provide students with good paying job!

You see the whole purpose of the Earn While You Learn Program is to make the students of Edoofa so competent that by the time they reach the final year of their education, they should be able to get good job opportunities.
06/03/24, 2:12 pm - +263 77 381 4143: Noted thank u sir
06/03/24, 2:26 pm - Gurvinder: I hope you are aware of the cost of education after the scholarship and also about the 7-day enrollment fee payment deadline.
06/03/24, 2:28 pm - +263 77 381 4143: Yes we are aware
06/03/24, 2:29 pm - Gurvinder: So @263773814143 , before we move to the Eligibility Procedures, can you tell me

1. What is the name of the course that @263774819660 would be studying through the Edoofa Program?

2. In which country will your child be studying through the Edoofa program?

3. What is the average cost of studies in India without a scholarship?

4. What is the annual fee you will pay if found eligible for the program?

5. What is the enrollment fee of the Edoofa Program and in how many days is it paid if you are found eligible?

6. Please elaborate on your understanding of the Earn While You Learn program in 75-100 words.

7. After receiving your offer letter from the University, you will have to pay your registration fee in order to finalise your university selection and reserve your scholarship seat in a particular university, this registration fee will be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?
06/03/24, 2:59 pm - +263 77 381 4143: 1.B.tech Mechanical engineering
2. India
3. $6000_$8000
4. $2000_$3000
5. $350 and 7 days to pay
06/03/24, 3:03 pm - +263 77 381 4143: 6 As I understand the EWYL program is meant to help the students to pay there fees . There will be doing projects with EDOOFA partners who pay their amounts directly to their specific schools .The salaries vary according to the project a student will be doing. This program benefits more to parents since it reduces the amounts they're supposed to be paying. It teaches the students to develop professional skills , time management and many more .
7 Yes
06/03/24, 3:06 pm - Gurvinder: *@263773814143*,  I am happy to see that you understand the program details so well. I totally understand that you have work to do and So I really appreciate your cooperation and the time you are taking out to support your child.
06/03/24, 3:06 pm - +263 77 381 4143: Thank u
06/03/24, 3:06 pm - Gurvinder: Please note that the number of scholarship seats is limited in number, and in case *Bridget* is selected for the scholarship we expect that you are clear and aware of all the details shared during the session along with that you also obey the rules and honour the scholarship terms.
06/03/24, 3:07 pm - Gurvinder: In case you do not follow these terms then *Bridget’s* entire scholarship process will go into backlog and you will only be able to apply for the scholarship after 6 months. By then the entire fee structure for the scholarship program may increase*.
06/03/24, 3:11 pm - +263 77 381 4143: Noted
06/03/24, 3:19 pm - Gurvinder: Ideally, as you know, the tentative dates are:
1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the *11th or 12th of March 2024* for $200 and the *11th or 12th of April 2024* for the remaining $150.
2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the *11th or 12th of March 2024*
06/03/24, 3:19 pm - Gurvinder: Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?

06/03/24, 3:31 pm - Gurvinder: That is great.
06/03/24, 3:31 pm - Gurvinder: Please address this in the next half an hour.
06/03/24, 3:58 pm - +263 77 381 4143: I understand that as a parent i should support and encourage my child throughout the decision making process.
I should help here to gather information about various tertiary education options and have time to talk with other parents who have their kids studying at local universities and know their challenges.
As a parent i should plan my financials and well structured my budgets so that i don't disturb my child to set her goals .

She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program former students of St. David's Bonda which also happens to be our associate school, they are currently studying Sociology and Law in India.
