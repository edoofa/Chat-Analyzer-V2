*I am Mr Gurvinder Singh, Senior Career Counselor at Edoofa*

We have received an application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program from your friend and our student.

I hope I have contacted the right person.

I would like you to come online so that I could discuss with you the form you submitted online and what I was able to understand from the same!
04/03/24, 3:59 pm - +27 65 386 2593: Hie
04/03/24, 4:02 pm - Gurvinder: It is a pleasure to connect with you today Mrs Jeti,

You can address me as Mr Gurvinder, we do have Mr Shubham, Senior Academician, and  Mr Jyotishman, Head of Admissions who will be evaluating your responses for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
04/03/24, 4:04 pm - +27 65 386 2593: Alrighty Mr Gurvinder. Thank you
04/03/24, 4:05 pm - Gurvinder: Alright, so Mrs Jeti, I can see you got to know about the Edoofa Program from TADIWANASHE, is that correct?
04/03/24, 4:07 pm - +27 65 386 2593: Correct
04/03/24, 4:08 pm - Gurvinder: Okay, so can you tell me what all did you learn about the Edoofa Program from Tadiwanashe, also do tell me whether you learnt about Tadiwanashe’s Journey and Experience with the Edoofa Program?
04/03/24, 4:13 pm - +27 65 386 2593: Honestly speaking I haven't learned much about Edoofa program. I am staying in south Africa and my daughter Lissa is the one who communicated with Tadiwanashe and I guess she was interested that's when sho told me about this
04/03/24, 4:17 pm - Gurvinder: Noted, let me brief you about the program myself.
04/03/24, 4:17 pm - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
04/03/24, 4:17 pm - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
04/03/24, 4:17 pm - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
04/03/24, 4:17 pm - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
04/03/24, 4:27 pm - +27 65 386 2593: Thank you very much for your briefing.
05/03/24, 9:06 am - Gurvinder: Good morning, everyone!

I hope this message finds you well.

I request everyone to come online so that we can continue with our session.
06/03/24, 11:54 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning Everyone,
I would like to inform you that, you have been inactive throughout the counselling session, I would like you to complete your counselling session today or I would have to close your application.
06/03/24, 9:36 pm - Gurvinder: Hi Dear, I hope you are doing well.

I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons that I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship. 

I hope to get a positive response from you soon.
07/03/24, 7:47 am - +27 65 386 2593: Good morning
07/03/24, 9:51 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning Everyone,
I would like to inform you that, you have been inactive throughout the counselling session, I would like you to complete your counselling session today or I would have to close your application.
07/03/24, 10:00 am - +27 65 386 2593: Ok let's carry on
07/03/24, 10:27 am - Gurvinder: May I know, why have you been so inactive?
07/03/24, 11:07 am - +27 65 386 2593: Pressure at work
07/03/24, 11:29 am - Gurvinder: Please I cannot move ahead if you are not active.
07/03/24, 2:55 pm - Gurvinder: Are we still connected?
07/03/24, 3:03 pm - +27 65 386 2593: Yes
07/03/24, 3:07 pm - Gurvinder: May I know, why did you went inactive again?
07/03/24, 3:30 pm - +27 65 386 2593: I'm responding as soon as I get your messages. If you are not getting them right away it's network problems
07/03/24, 3:33 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so Mrs Jeti, as we start your counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
07/03/24, 3:35 pm - +27 65 386 2593: Yes I do
07/03/24, 3:46 pm - Gurvinder: Now Mrs Jeti, I would like to know Lissa better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about her, her career aspiration do include sharing about:-

1. Her highest education level?
2. The course she would like to study?
3. What do you parents do?
4. What is the parent’s highest education level?
5. Who has been supporting her for her Education so far?
6. Who will be supporting her financially for her higher education abroad?
7. Does she have any siblings? if yes, what do they do?
8. May I know which school does she studies at and in which province is it located along with that how much was her per-term fee in A level?



Please elaborate on your answers and answer them in points, so that I can understand your application more briefly and assist you in a better way
07/03/24, 4:00 pm - +27 65 386 2593: Lissa is a well behaved girl who always aims for better in whatever she does. Her career is to study Law and also interested in nursing.
