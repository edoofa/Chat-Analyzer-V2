*I am Mr Gurvinder Singh, Senior Career Counselor at Edoofa*

We have received an application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program from your friend and our student.

I hope I have contacted the right person.

I would like you to come online so that I could discuss with you the form you submitted online and what I was able to understand from the same!
04/03/24, 2:47 pm - +263 71 369 0001: Good afternoon guys
04/03/24, 2:54 pm - Gurvinder: It is a pleasure to connect with you today Clemence,

You can address me as Mr Gurvinder, we do have Mr Shubham, Senior Academician, and  Mr Jyotishman, Head of Admissions who will be evaluating your responses for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
04/03/24, 2:56 pm - +263 71 369 0001: Okay nice to communicate with you
04/03/24, 2:57 pm - Gurvinder: Alright, so Clemence, I can see you got to know about the Edoofa Program from Thrive, is that correct?
04/03/24, 2:57 pm - +263 71 369 0001: Yes sir
04/03/24, 2:59 pm - Gurvinder: Okay, so can you tell me what all did you learn about the Edoofa Program from Thrive, also do tell me whether you learnt about Thrive’s Journey and Experience with the Edoofa Program?
04/03/24, 3:15 pm - +263 71 369 0001: Okay ,so I learnt that Edoofa is a platform for students to pursue affordable higher education in India through scholarships,it can offer scholarships ranging from 50 to 100% of their tuition fee
04/03/24, 3:17 pm - Gurvinder: That is correct, let me brief you more.
04/03/24, 3:17 pm - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
04/03/24, 3:17 pm - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
04/03/24, 3:18 pm - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
04/03/24, 3:18 pm - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
04/03/24, 3:20 pm - +263 71 369 0001: Yes you are correct,thank you
04/03/24, 3:20 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so Clemence, as we start your counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
04/03/24, 3:22 pm - +263 71 369 0001: Yes I have what it takes.
04/03/24, 3:22 pm - Gurvinder: Now Clemence, I would like to know you better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about yourself, your career aspiration do include sharing about:-

1. Your highest education level?
2. The course you would like to study?
3. What do your parents do?

7. Do you have any siblings? if yes, what do they do?
8. May I know which school do you study at and in which province is it located along with that how much was your per-term fee in A level?

Please elaborate on your answers and answer them in points, so that I can understand your application more briefly and assist you in a better way

07/03/24, 11:13 am - +263 71 369 0001: So Mr Gurvinder ,if I get a chance to be taken in as a fellow Edoofian , five years after completing this course I would like to work under NASA for the first two years, then continue my studies further more to reach M.Tech . So, Edoofa as support,I think the journey should be interesting and smooth through out the first three years.From the start my goals were to be an aircraft engineer whose expertise is not only to repair aircraft but to also design aircraft , with this goal in mind I am very sure that Edoofa will be for there for me as a helping hand.
07/03/24, 11:14 am - +263 71 369 0001: Good morning how are you
07/03/24, 11:16 am - +263 71 369 0001: I am so sorry Mr Gurvinder,there were some interactions in our local network

07/03/24, 11:35 am - Gurvinder: So I can see that they had seen my messages and still didn't respond or shared that you were having this problem, may I know, why is that the case?
07/03/24, 11:38 am - +263 71 369 0001: Sir ,we were experiencing the same problem

07/03/24, 11:41 am - +263 71 369 0001: I sincerely apologize sir
07/03/24, 11:41 am - +263 71 369 0001: So Mr Gurvinder ,if I get a chance to be taken in as a fellow Edoofian , five years after completing this course I would like to work under NASA for the first two years, then continue my studies further more to reach M.Tech . So, Edoofa as support,I think the journey should be interesting and smooth through out the first three years.From the start my goals were to be an aircraft engineer whose expertise is not only to repair aircraft but to also design aircraft , with this goal in mind I am very sure that Edoofa will be for there for me as a helping hand.
07/03/24, 11:43 am - Gurvinder: That is really great Clemence I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations,

However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

Are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way inorder to transform your career dear?
07/03/24, 11:44 am - +263 71 369 0001: Yes sir .
07/03/24, 11:45 am - Gurvinder: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
07/03/24, 11:47 am - +263 71 369 0001: Sir , I think studying abroad has a bigger advantage because I can be recognized world wide with my degree.
07/03/24, 11:47 am - Gurvinder: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
07/03/24, 11:52 am - +263 71 369 0001: Knowing that my country needs an improvement in the education system ,I would then come back to Zimbabwe and implement those ways of studying that I have learnt from your side.
07/03/24, 11:59 am - Gurvinder: I appreciate your sense of hardworking for your community Clemence, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?
07/03/24, 12:01 pm - +263 71 369 0001: Yes I agree.
07/03/24, 12:03 pm - Gurvinder: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
07/03/24, 12:04 pm - +263 71 369 0001: Yes that is correct.
07/03/24, 12:05 pm - Gurvinder: You see Edoofa’s vision to provide every student with an education that is not just affordable but accessible and employable as well can only be achieved by utilizing the infrastructure of Indian Education landscape that has been developed over the last 75+ years since India’s Independence.
07/03/24, 12:06 pm - Gurvinder: *Following are the reasons as to Why Edoofa Focuses on India for Scholarships: A Quick Look!*

07/03/24, 12:12 pm - +263 71 369 0001: Wow sir ,that is very wonderful
07/03/24, 12:15 pm - Gurvinder: So now Clemence, I hope you must have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead. As of now would you like to ask anything so far?
07/03/24, 12:17 pm - +263 71 369 0001: No sir.
07/03/24, 12:21 pm - Gurvinder: I appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country. In this process did you make any prior research on foreign education or applied to any University abroad?
07/03/24, 12:22 pm - +263 71 369 0001: Yes I did some research.
07/03/24, 12:25 pm - Gurvinder: So now moving ahead by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India?
07/03/24, 12:26 pm - +263 71 369 0001: Yes .
07/03/24, 12:29 pm - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
07/03/24, 12:29 pm - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
07/03/24, 12:29 pm - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
07/03/24, 12:30 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
07/03/24, 12:30 pm - Gurvinder: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*

*after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
07/03/24, 12:32 pm - +263 71 369 0001: Wow that is wonderful.
07/03/24, 12:33 pm - Gurvinder: So now shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?
07/03/24, 12:34 pm - +263 71 369 0001: Yes you may.
07/03/24, 12:38 pm - Gurvinder: Clemence, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
07/03/24, 12:39 pm - +263 71 369 0001: I see that it is helpful.
07/03/24, 12:45 pm - Gurvinder: The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion.

07/03/24, 12:45 pm - Gurvinder: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase. 

*What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
07/03/24, 12:48 pm - +263 71 369 0001: I think this is really beneficial.
07/03/24, 12:49 pm - Gurvinder: I am delighted to hear that Clemence, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
07/03/24, 12:51 pm - +263 71 369 0001: Ok so it is brilliant.
07/03/24, 12:52 pm - +263 71 369 0001: So how do I work on earning the scholarship credit
07/03/24, 12:56 pm - Gurvinder: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

07/03/24, 12:56 pm - Gurvinder: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
07/03/24, 12:58 pm - +263 71 369 0001: Yes I have been looking forward to this .
07/03/24, 1:16 pm - Gurvinder: Alright Clemence, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
07/03/24, 2:55 pm - Gurvinder: Are we still connected?
07/03/24, 3:37 pm - +263 71 369 0001: Yes sir.
07/03/24, 3:38 pm - +263 71 369 0001: Yes
07/03/24, 3:39 pm - +263 71 369 0001: Sir the network is tripping again
07/03/24, 3:47 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so may I know if you have discussed international education plans with them in depth?
07/03/24, 4:29 pm - +263 71 369 0001: Yes sir
07/03/24, 8:19 pm - +263 71 369 0001: Good evening sir.
