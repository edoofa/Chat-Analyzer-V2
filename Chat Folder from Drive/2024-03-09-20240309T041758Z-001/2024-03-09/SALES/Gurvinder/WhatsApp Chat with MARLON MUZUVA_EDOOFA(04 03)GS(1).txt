*I am Mr Gurvinder Singh, Senior Career Counselor at Edoofa*

We have received an application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program from your friend and our student.

I hope I have contacted the right person.

I would like you to come online so that I could discuss with you the form you submitted online and what I was able to understand from the same!
05/03/24, 9:06 am - Gurvinder: Good morning, everyone!

I hope this message finds you well.

I request everyone to come online so that we can continue with our session.
06/03/24, 11:54 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning Everyone,
I would like to inform you that, you have been inactive throughout the counselling session, I would like you to complete your counselling session today or I would have to close your application.
06/03/24, 9:27 pm - +263 71 588 3627: Firstly l start with an apology l owe you , l haven't been online for the past few days because of WhatsApp bundle hardships.  Secondly l greet you all Dear Sirs/Madam and now l think l am ready for Counselling Sessions
06/03/24, 9:38 pm - Gurvinder: Hi Dear, I hope you are doing well.

I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons that I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship. 

I hope to get a positive response from you soon.
06/03/24, 9:43 pm - +263 71 588 3627: Ok Sir thanks l appreciate the time you're giving me . So l like your program  and l have got a hope that it is going to take me high in educational levels  So l want to study a degree in economics and a Masters degree in financing
07/03/24, 9:51 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning Everyone,
I would like to inform you that, you have been inactive throughout the counselling session, I would like you to complete your counselling session today or I would have to close your application.
07/03/24, 8:43 pm - Gurvinder: Hi Dear, I hope you are doing well

I was waiting for you to share your concerns with me but unfortunately, I didn’t hear from you and therefore I was asked to put your application on hold, but before doing the same, I was going through the form you submitted, I noticed that you come from a family background wherein you plan to pursue your higher education abroad and was looking for a scholarship. I am looking forward to hearing from you so that I can make your dream of higher education abroad come true through an affordable, accessible, and employment-oriented higher education program.
08/03/24, 11:50 am - Gurvinder: Good morning, everyone!

I hope this message finds you well.

I request everyone to come online so that we can continue with our session.
