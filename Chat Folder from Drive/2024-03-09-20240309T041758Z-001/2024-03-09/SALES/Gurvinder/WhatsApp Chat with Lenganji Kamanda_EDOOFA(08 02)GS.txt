We have received an application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program from your friend and our student.

I hope I have contacted the right person.

I would like you to come online so that I could discuss with you the form you submitted online and what I was able to understand from the same!
08/02/24, 8:42 pm - Gurvinder: Dear, I was expecting your response in the counseling session, but you could not get back to me due to some reason so I am about to finish my second counseling slot for the day, I will have to schedule your session for *Tomorrow at 10 am CAT*. 

Please note that I have two counseling slots in a day which are during my working hours from *7:30 am to 4:30 pm CAT Monday to Friday*, so to complete your application you would have to be present during that time. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning. Therefore I would like you to be online at the above-mentioned time for a smooth conversation.
09/02/24, 8:19 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning Everyone, 

*"Success is no accident. It is hard work, perseverance, learning, studying, sacrifice, and most of all, love of what you are doing or learning to do." - Pelé*

With all positive energy, Please come online to have an interactive session.
09/02/24, 11:11 am - +260 96 8631068: Good morning sir.

Sorry for the late response.
09/02/24, 11:54 am - Gurvinder: It is a pleasure to connect with you today Lenganji,

You can address me as Mr Gurvinder, we do have Mr Piiyush, Head of Counselling and  Mr Jyotishman, Head of Admissions who will be evaluating your responses for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
09/02/24, 11:58 am - +260 96 8631068: The pleasure is all mine Mr Gurvinder.
09/02/24, 12:02 pm - Gurvinder: Before we begin with the session, I would like to ask you, what prior understanding you have about the Edoofa Scholarship Program?
09/02/24, 12:18 pm - +260 96 8631068: The edoofa scholarship program is a social, for-profit organization that offers 50% to 100% scholarship to students.
The program also helps students aquire skills that help them earn jobs in various industries.
09/02/24, 12:26 pm - Gurvinder: That is correct, let me brief you more.
09/02/24, 12:26 pm - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
09/02/24, 12:26 pm - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
09/02/24, 12:26 pm - Gurvinder: EDOOFA has commended the new government for its dedicated efforts and positive changes in the education sector, including the elimination of school fees, an increase in the number of teachers, and a focus on protecting vulnerable learners, particularly adolescent girls. *Edoofa is proud to support the government in its mission to transform the education sector and achieve sustainable development, aimed at ensuring quality education that is inclusive and equitable for all by 2030.*
09/02/24, 12:26 pm - Gurvinder: With the influx of students from Zimbabwe, we recorded more than 1500 students to the program in each of the last two years. Having a strong network and grasp of more than 100 schools with a panel of Headmasters, teachers, parents, and other educators, we now look to replicate our success in Zambia as well where we have already begun enrolling students since the last 6 months and we have closed 2023 intake with over 1500 students.
09/02/24, 12:26 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
09/02/24, 12:26 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
09/02/24, 12:26 pm - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
09/02/24, 12:32 pm - +260 96 8631068: Yes I am. And everything is well noted.
Thank you for the information.
09/02/24, 12:50 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so Lenganji, as we start your counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship? <This message was edited>
09/02/24, 12:51 pm - +260 96 8631068: Yes I do, Mr Gurvinder
09/02/24, 12:52 pm - Gurvinder: Now Lenganji, I would like to know you better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about yourself, your career aspiration do include sharing about:-

1. Your highest education level?
2. The course you would like to study?
3. What do your parents do?
4. What is your parent’s highest education level?
5. Who has been supporting you for your Education so far?
6. Who will be supporting you financially for your higher education abroad?
7. Do you have any siblings? if yes, what do they do?
8. May I know which school do you study at and in which province is it located along with that how much was your per-term fee in Grade 12?

Please elaborate on your answers and answer them in points, so that I can understand your application more briefly and assist you in a better way
09/02/24, 1:35 pm - +260 96 8631068: 👉My name is Lenganji Kamanda and I am an only child. I completed my Grade 12 exams last year in which I did well with flying colors.

👉I wish to study abroad especially in India because the country is known for its remarkable excellent students and high quality education.

👉Both my parents are government teachers.

👉 Both my parents have Grade 12 certificates and are degree holders which is very inspiring to me considering their backgrounds and what they went through when they were young.

👉My parents have been supporting despite having a number of financial problems.

👉 I completed my secondary school education at Kapiri girls national technical secondary school last year. The school is located in kapiri Mposhi, Central Province, Zambia.
And we used to pay a maximum tuition fee of K1000.

That's all I can say about myself.
09/02/24, 1:37 pm - Gurvinder: It is a pleasure to know you, Lenganji, but can you tell me in which field of study, you want to do a course in?
09/02/24, 1:38 pm - +260 96 8631068: Civil Engineering, sir.
09/02/24, 1:38 pm - Gurvinder: So now as we proceed ahead, I have a question, during your introduction you mentioned you would like to study Civil Engineering, could you please share what motivates you behind this field of study?
09/02/24, 1:50 pm - +260 96 8631068: When I was in secondary school I used to take Design and Technology. And I absolutely loved everything about the subject especially construction activities.

Civil Engineering will not only be a 'dream come true' to me but it will also be an opportunity for me to build structures that will make the world an easier and safer place to live.
09/02/24, 1:55 pm - Gurvinder: Your passion for construction activities and your enjoyment of Design and Technology in secondary school provide a strong foundation for pursuing civil engineering. Your desire to contribute to building structures that improve the safety and convenience of our world is truly admirable.
09/02/24, 1:55 pm - Gurvinder: So if I may ask from your family or known circle has anyone pursued a career in this field?
09/02/24, 1:56 pm - +260 96 8631068: No one in my family has ever pursued a career in this field.
Though my uncle is currently studying chemical engineering.
09/02/24, 2:00 pm - Gurvinder: Alright so now can you share your Grade 10 and Grade 12 results for evaluation?
09/02/24, 2:01 pm - +260 96 8631068: <Media omitted>
09/02/24, 2:02 pm - +260 96 8631068: I don't have my grade 10 results, Mr Gurvinder.
09/02/24, 2:04 pm - Gurvinder: So may I know, why didn't you take pure physics and pure chemistry if you wanted to do Civil Engineering?
09/02/24, 2:06 pm - +260 96 8631068: The pure Sciences class was full when I reported for school and the only available classes where the Design and Technology class and the Food and Nutrition class.
09/02/24, 2:09 pm - Gurvinder: Lenganji, if you would have researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*. whereas if they want to study any Engineering Course then they should have *Physics, Chemistry and Maths* in their A level mandatorily.
09/02/24, 2:10 pm - +260 96 8631068: I didn't know about that.
09/02/24, 2:11 pm - Gurvinder: May I suggest you a field that is future proof and is well in demand nowdays?
09/02/24, 2:12 pm - +260 96 8631068: Yes sir.
You may
09/02/24, 2:14 pm - Gurvinder: So what do you think about Computer Science, as that is one skill that our future needs, and gives the student a lot of opportunities?
09/02/24, 2:16 pm - +260 96 8631068: Does software engineering fall under the same program?

And how long is the program?
09/02/24, 2:18 pm - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the program.

09/02/24, 2:21 pm - +260 96 8631068: Thank you for the briefing, Mr Gurvinder.
09/02/24, 2:22 pm - Gurvinder: So did you understand the course?
09/02/24, 2:23 pm - +260 96 8631068: Yes I do, Mr Gurvinder.
09/02/24, 2:26 pm - Gurvinder: So do you want to go ahead with this course?
09/02/24, 2:27 pm - +260 96 8631068: It will depend on the scholarship I will be able to get, honestly.
09/02/24, 2:30 pm - Gurvinder: Please, that I understand, but if you get the scholarship, do you want to go ahead with it?
09/02/24, 2:31 pm - +260 96 8631068: Yes I would, sir.
09/02/24, 2:31 pm - +260 97 2019516: Good afternoon.
09/02/24, 2:32 pm - +260 97 2019516: This is Mr Kamanda.
Lenganji Kamanda's father.
09/02/24, 2:34 pm - Gurvinder: It is a pleasure to connect with you Mr Kamanda.
09/02/24, 2:34 pm - Gurvinder: Since you have understood the course properly can you now tell me in 150 to 200 words that if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself 5 years after the completion of this course and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
09/02/24, 2:49 pm - +260 96 8631068: From what I understand about Computer Science, I would say technology is continuously evolving.
Hence, there's need for more computer experts.

For example in the gaming industry.
Recent reports state that there has been a rapid increase in the number of people playing video games and this may result in the demand of more developed games.
Therefore, computer science would be a great example if I decided to become a Game Developer.

Another example would be in marketing industry.
Seeing that, a number of companies are now advertising their products digitally.
There's a call for more competent graphic designers.

All in all with the constant evolution in technology, there is high demand of people with more knowledge in technology.
09/02/24, 2:50 pm - Gurvinder: That is really great Lenganji I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations,

However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

Are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way inorder to transform your career dear?
09/02/24, 2:52 pm - +260 96 8631068: Yes I am willing to do that, Mr Gurvinder.

For great success comes with a lot of hardwork.
09/02/24, 2:53 pm - Gurvinder: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
09/02/24, 3:01 pm - +260 96 8631068: Actually sir I am fine with studying anywhere, be it my country or abroad.

All that I am seeking is a scholarship or bursary because my parents will not be able to fully sponsor me in University.
09/02/24, 3:05 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
09/02/24, 3:16 pm - +260 96 8631068: As we all know Zambia is a developing country. 
And it would be an honor to offer my services to the Zambian government by being a specialist advisor.
I will also volunteer to teach computer science to those willing to learn.
And also offer suggestions to various industries in the country.
09/02/24, 3:17 pm - Gurvinder: I appreciate your sense of hardworking for your community Lenganji, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?
09/02/24, 3:18 pm - +260 96 8631068: Yes I agree, Mr Gurvinder.
09/02/24, 3:19 pm - Gurvinder: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
09/02/24, 3:23 pm - +260 96 8631068: Well I think it's because India has one of the highest education systems in Asia.
09/02/24, 3:24 pm - Gurvinder: You see Edoofa’s vision to provide every student with an education that is not just affordable but accessible and employable as well can only be achieved by utilizing the infrastructure of Indian Education landscape that has been developed over the last 75+ years since India’s Independence.
09/02/24, 3:24 pm - Gurvinder: *Following are the reasons as to Why Edoofa Focuses on India for Scholarships: A Quick Look!*

1. *Robust Education System:* India has 1000+ universities and 39,931 colleges offering diverse educational paths.

09/02/24, 3:30 pm - +260 96 8631068: This is impressive, sir.
India is truly a remarkable country.
09/02/24, 3:33 pm - Gurvinder: So now Lenganji, I hope you must have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead. As of now would you like to ask anything so far?
09/02/24, 3:34 pm - +260 96 8631068: How long is computer science and is it the same as computer engineering.
09/02/24, 3:36 pm - Gurvinder: Please the course offered to you is for 3 years and focuses more on practical applications of computer science than Computer Engineering.
09/02/24, 3:37 pm - +260 96 8631068: Thank you, Mr Gurvinder.
That being answered,I have no more questions.
09/02/24, 3:37 pm - Gurvinder: So now moving ahead by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India?
09/02/24, 3:38 pm - +260 96 8631068: The cost should be $6000 - $8000
09/02/24, 3:38 pm - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
09/02/24, 3:38 pm - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
09/02/24, 3:38 pm - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
09/02/24, 3:39 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
09/02/24, 3:39 pm - Gurvinder: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*

*after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
09/02/24, 3:43 pm - +260 96 8631068: Thank you for the briefing.

And what does the earn while you learn exactly do?
09/02/24, 3:43 pm - Gurvinder: Lenganji, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
09/02/24, 3:52 pm - +260 96 8631068: Thank you for the explanation.
09/02/24, 3:56 pm - Gurvinder: The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

*1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

09/02/24, 3:56 pm - Gurvinder: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase. 

*What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
09/02/24, 4:01 pm - +260 96 8631068: I think it is a very good opportunity in the sense that students get to acquire practical skills which help them in their careers.
09/02/24, 4:02 pm - Gurvinder: I am delighted to hear that Lenganji, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
09/02/24, 4:03 pm - +260 96 8631068: Does that apply to those who obtain 100% scholarship
09/02/24, 4:04 pm - Gurvinder: Yes, they can also take part of the program, if they want to learn those skills.
09/02/24, 4:04 pm - +260 96 8631068: Well understood.
09/02/24, 4:06 pm - Gurvinder: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

09/02/24, 4:06 pm - Gurvinder: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
09/02/24, 4:11 pm - +260 96 8631068: Yes it is a really remarkable program and quite different from the rest.
09/02/24, 4:13 pm - Gurvinder: Alright Lenganji, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
09/02/24, 4:14 pm - +260 96 8631068: Yes they will be supporting me
09/02/24, 4:18 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so may I know if you have discussed international education plans with them in depth?

Have a good day ahead. 
God Bless You!
15/02/24, 9:56 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning Everyone,

Please come online so that we can continue with the session.
15/02/24, 11:01 am - +260 96 8631068: Good morning sir
15/02/24, 11:25 am - Gurvinder: May I know, why have you been so inactive?
15/02/24, 11:29 am - +260 96 8631068: I'm sorry.
A family issue came up
15/02/24, 11:29 am - +260 96 8631068: We lost a family member.
15/02/24, 12:26 pm - Gurvinder: I am so sorry to hear that.
15/02/24, 12:26 pm - Gurvinder: So are you available for a session now?
15/02/24, 1:11 pm - +260 96 8631068: Yes I am
16/02/24, 8:02 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning Everyone,
I would like you to excuse me for not participating in the session yesterday, I had a family emergency,
Please come online so that we can continue with the session.
16/02/24, 2:02 pm - +260 96 8631068: Good afternoon sir.
16/02/24, 2:04 pm - Gurvinder: Please address this.
16/02/24, 2:05 pm - +260 96 8631068: Yes we have talked about the matter.
16/02/24, 2:08 pm - Gurvinder: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
16/02/24, 2:10 pm - +260 96 8631068: Okay
16/02/24, 2:12 pm - Gurvinder: Lenganji as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
16/02/24, 2:14 pm - +260 96 8631068: $1500-$2250
16/02/24, 2:17 pm - Gurvinder: Exactly Lenganji, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
16/02/24, 2:17 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
16/02/24, 2:18 pm - +260 96 8631068: Well noted.
16/02/24, 2:22 pm - Gurvinder: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
16/02/24, 2:24 pm - +260 96 8631068: I believe it is.
16/02/24, 2:25 pm - Gurvinder: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
16/02/24, 2:25 pm - Gurvinder: Basically, there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee, before their Grade 12 result is out).


Phase 3: Once the final grade 12 results are out, if the student would have passed the necessary requirement (of 4 Grade 12 passes.) then start with their University Interaction. If the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents.


The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.

However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
16/02/24, 2:59 pm - +260 96 8631068: I understand.
16/02/24, 3:00 pm - Gurvinder: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.

Are you familiar with the Edoofa Cycle?
16/02/24, 3:03 pm - +260 96 8631068: No I am not.
16/02/24, 3:03 pm - Gurvinder: Alright Lenganji, as you can see, we are currently at Step 1. After this step, you will proceed to Step 2. If you successfully pass Step 2, you will receive your Acceptance Letter from the Edoofa Academic Board in Step 3. After that, as shown in the image above, the completion of your Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4.

Upon completing your formalities, in Step 5: we will initiate your Edoofa Admission Process and your Earn While You Learn Program. We will assign your complete application to our Admission Officers and the Head Coach of the Earn While You Learn Program.

The Admission Officers will be responsible for assisting you with all the required admission documentation that we discussed earlier, including the Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendation, and the completion of applications in all of Edoofa’s Associated Universities, etc.

The Head Coach will be responsible for assigning your application to the Earn While You Learn Program Mentor, who will then evaluate your candidature and assist with projects and assignments throughout your journey with the Edoofa Program.
16/02/24, 3:03 pm - Gurvinder: As an organization that has positively impacted the lives of tens of thousands of African students, we understand that over 97% of parents face financial challenges when planning for their child’s tertiary education. In fact, it is one of the most prominent fears because of which there are parents who despite understanding the kind of growth their child would get through international education, still opt for their children to study in their home country.

Now in our quest to overcome this challenge, I would like to inform you that in Stage 5, while our Admission officers assist with all the necessary admission-related documentation, Edoofa’s Financial Planning team will connect with your parents to help them plan finances for your higher education.

Since in the majority of African nations inflation is a real challenge, keeping in mind that the cost of living in your home country increases atleast by 20% year on year, Financial Planning officers will be responsible for helping your parents plan for your tertiary education in a way that ensures they are not burdened financially throughout your education. Financial planning would include the following aspects:-
*Budgeting for your higher education, as per your parent's affordability.*
*Supporting your parents in building your tertiary education fund.*
16/02/24, 3:03 pm - Gurvinder: I hope you now have an in-depth understanding of what happens in Stage 5 of your Edoofa Cycle?
16/02/24, 3:16 pm - Gurvinder: Are we still connected?
16/02/24, 3:18 pm - +260 96 8631068: Yes I understand.
16/02/24, 3:19 pm - Gurvinder: In Step 6: Once the Financial Planning Team assists your parents in budgeting for your higher education, moving forward you will receive offer letters from the universities where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to complete the required registration process,  as well as finalizing the University. *In order to reserve your seat in any particular University chosen by you a registration fee would have to be paid which would be adjusted through your budgeting done in Stage 5 of the Edoofa Cycle.*

*NOTE:- The registration fee adjusted is not an additional cost, rather it is a part of your first year’s annual fee*
16/02/24, 3:19 pm - Gurvinder: *After a few weeks of your registration process, you will be given your Final Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL), which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
16/02/24, 3:19 pm - Gurvinder: So now would you like to ask anything?
16/02/24, 3:20 pm - +260 96 8631068: Nothing at all.
16/02/24, 3:21 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check
16/02/24, 3:21 pm - Gurvinder: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
16/02/24, 3:21 pm - Gurvinder: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

02/03/24, 9:57 am - Gurvinder: Good morning, everyone!

I hope this message finds you well.

I request everyone to come online so that we can continue with our session.
02/03/24, 11:36 am - +260 96 8631068: Good afternoon sir
02/03/24, 11:38 am - +260 97 2019516: Good afternoon sir.
This is Mr Kamanda.
02/03/24, 1:06 pm - Gurvinder: Please I hope you have been following the session so far.

So are there any questions that you or your family would like to ask regarding the program details?
02/03/24, 1:07 pm - +260 97 2019516: Yes sir.
02/03/24, 1:08 pm - +260 97 2019516: Are there any other courses that you can recommend my daughter to do apart from computer science
02/03/24, 1:33 pm - Gurvinder: Please this is the course I personally suggested her.
02/03/24, 1:37 pm - +260 97 2019516: I was kindly asking if you could suggest another field of study under engineering.
02/03/24, 1:38 pm - +260 97 2019516: And what scholarship is she likely to be given
02/03/24, 2:07 pm - Gurvinder: May I know the reason behind that?
02/03/24, 2:11 pm - +260 97 2019516: I have always wanted her to do civil Engineering or architecture.
02/03/24, 2:19 pm - Gurvinder: Mrs Moyo, if you would have researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*. whereas if they want to study any Engineering Course then they should have *Physics, Chemistry and Maths* in their A level mandatorily.

I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons that I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship. 

I hope to get a positive response from you soon.
07/03/24, 9:56 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning Everyone,

07/03/24, 8:53 pm - Gurvinder: Hi Dear, I hope you are doing well

I was waiting for you to share your concerns with me but unfortunately, I didn’t hear from you and therefore I was asked to put your application on hold, but before doing the same, I was going through the form you submitted, I noticed that you come from a family background wherein you plan to pursue your higher education abroad and was looking for a scholarship. I am looking forward to hearing from you so that I can make your dream of higher education abroad come true through an affordable, accessible, and employment-oriented higher education program.
08/03/24, 11:55 am - Gurvinder: Good morning, everyone!

I hope this message finds you well.
