28/02/24, 9:55 am - Keshav Edoofa: Let me further Elaborate about Edoofa Scholarship program to you
28/02/24, 9:55 am - Keshav Edoofa: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
28/02/24, 9:55 am - Keshav Edoofa: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
28/02/24, 9:55 am - Keshav Edoofa: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
28/02/24, 9:56 am - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>
28/02/24, 9:56 am - Keshav Edoofa: It is with great pride that i would like to share with you that, recently we hosted a special conference for our Edoofians studying in India,  *SLICE - CON'24 - Symposium of Leaders, Innovators and Creators with Edoofa*, The students embarked on an enlightening industrial visit, immersing themselves in dynamic interactions with our esteemed Founders, CEOs, and visionary entrepreneurs. This is one of the many benefits of the Edoofa Scholarship Program and have a look at the glimpses of this auspicious 3 day event.
28/02/24, 10:02 am - +27 62 601 7048: Thank you so much for this program and I really appreciate
28/02/24, 10:02 am - Keshav Edoofa: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students Takudzwa can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards his higher education by yourself and help his parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
28/02/24, 10:03 am - +27 62 601 7048: Yes that's true
28/02/24, 10:05 am - Keshav Edoofa: Great Mrs. Lindiwe
28/02/24, 10:05 am - Keshav Edoofa: I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.
28/02/24, 10:05 am - +27 62 601 7048: Sorry for my English
28/02/24, 10:06 am - Keshav Edoofa: Its perfectly fine Mrs. Lindiwe
28/02/24, 10:06 am - +27 62 601 7048: Thanks
28/02/24, 10:18 am - Keshav Edoofa: Alright so Mrs. Lindiwe, now to help Takudzwa in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with his introduction.

I would like to know Takudzwa  better as a student, so please go ahead, and tell me a bit about him, Takudzwa  education, what he wish to study, his strengths, his weaknesses, his hobbies, and a detailed description of his family background, *Where do you as parents work (Place) in your country or any other country that you have relocated to due to work promises?  Which field do you specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work) since I honestly don't know a lot about Takudzwa ?
28/02/24, 10:26 am - +27 62 601 7048: Takudzwa is my second born son ,he is doing A level at Mufakose high 1 school  in Harare Mufakose.He is doing good at school .his hobbies is football he likes soccer .I work in south Africa as a Maid in Capetown
28/02/24, 10:31 am - Keshav Edoofa: May I know who has supported his tertiary education till now and who is going to support him financially with his higher education abroad? <This message was edited>
28/02/24, 10:33 am - +27 62 601 7048: For now his uncle helped him
28/02/24, 10:37 am - +27 62 601 7048: He is a career driven
28/02/24, 10:38 am - +27 62 601 7048: He concentrate with an task given it's his strength
28/02/24, 10:39 am - Keshav Edoofa: Are you as parents along with @263772765778 willing to support him financially for his education abroad?
28/02/24, 10:40 am - +27 62 601 7048: We are willing but we don't have money
28/02/24, 10:41 am - Keshav Edoofa: Is his Uncle going to support him in that case @27626017048 ?
28/02/24, 10:42 am - +27 62 601 7048: His not capable so he can not
28/02/24, 10:43 am - Keshav Edoofa: let me explain to you that there are two kinds of programs that provide assistance to the students because a lot of times parents and students themselves misunderstand what a Scholarship actually means.

*1. Scholarships*
*2. Sponsorships*

Scholarships make education *affordable* for the students by reducing their *Tuition Fees*, now a lot of times parents and students consider that a Domestic Scholarship would be the same as an International Scholarship, but to understand the difference between them, consider yourself applying for an education in your own country with the help of a scholarship. Now after the scholarship when your tuition fee would be reduced, eventually your entire cost of education would be reduced because being a citizen of the country, you wouldn't be required to spend any fees on Accommodation and feeding separately since in that case, students would be staying with their families. However, if I personally plan to study in Zimbabwe with the same scholarship, I would have to incur some costs on Accommodation and Feeding because I am not a Zimbabwean Citizen. So a lot of times parents and students consider International Scholarship and Domestic Scholarship one and the same thing, but in reality, they aren't.

Sponsorships, on the other hand, take care entirely of a student's education, but because Sponsorships are provided by only a few organizations, there are a lot of terms and conditions which a student might need to follow in order to get the sponsorship, the most common term is that a student after completion of the course would have to work for the organization providing the sponsorship for a period of time.
28/02/24, 10:43 am - Keshav Edoofa: We at Edoofa provide scholarship to students and not sponsorships
28/02/24, 10:43 am - Keshav Edoofa: I will explain with to you with an example, Avg cost of education in India is 7-8000$ which is very low in comparison to other countries like US and UK where the cost ranges from 25,000-30000$ , thus after the Edoofa scholarship program that is after the scholarship you receive the fee comes down to 2-3000$ per annum which includes tuition fee , accommodation university expense, and food! <This message was edited>

I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship. 

I hope to get a positive response from you soon.
