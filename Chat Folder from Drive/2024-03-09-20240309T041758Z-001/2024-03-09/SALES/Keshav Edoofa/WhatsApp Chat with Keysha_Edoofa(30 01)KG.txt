30/01/24, 11:31 am - Keshav Edoofa: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
30/01/24, 11:31 am - Keshav Edoofa: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
30/01/24, 11:31 am - Keshav Edoofa: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
30/01/24, 11:31 am - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>
30/01/24, 11:31 am - Keshav Edoofa: It is with great pride that i would like to share with you that, recently we hosted a special conference for our Edoofians studying in India,  *SLICE - CON'24 - Symposium of Leaders, Innovators and Creators with Edoofa*, The students embarked on an enlightening industrial visit, immersing themselves in dynamic interactions with our esteemed Founders, CEOs, and visionary entrepreneurs. This is one of the many benefits of the Edoofa Scholarship Program and have a look at the glimpses of this auspicious 3 day event.

30/01/24, 11:37 am - Keshav Edoofa: I feel you too Keysha are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
30/01/24, 11:37 am - Keshav Edoofa: I shall brief everything in detail as we move ahead in the session Mrs. Annie <This message was edited>
30/01/24, 11:40 am - +263 78 117 3528: Yes it is true ,I would like to study and also reduce the financial burden on my guardians they have fought for me and I would really wish  to help them in any way I can

30/01/24, 11:41 am - +263 77 315 6876: It sounds like a good idea i must admit
30/01/24, 11:41 am - Keshav Edoofa: Okay so Keysha, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.
30/01/24, 11:45 am - +263 77 315 6876: Ok noted
30/01/24, 11:47 am - Keshav Edoofa: Alright so Keysha, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.

I would like to know you better as a student, so please go ahead, and tell me a bit about yourself, your education, what you wish to study, your strengths, your weaknesses, your hobbies, and a detailed description of your family background, *Where do your parents work (Place) in your country or any other country that they have relocated to due to work promises?  Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work) since I honestly don't know a lot about you?*

30/01/24, 1:52 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

30/01/24, 3:09 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Yes Keysha perfectly summed up
30/01/24, 3:10 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I hope you must have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead. As of now would you like to ask anything so far?

Regarding your second question, the commencement of courses will be in August 2024

Hoping for the best
30/01/24, 3:27 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
30/01/24, 3:28 pm - Keshav Edoofa: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
30/01/24, 3:28 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
30/01/24, 3:28 pm - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>
30/01/24, 3:28 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
30/01/24, 3:44 pm - +263 77 315 6876: Ok noted
30/01/24, 3:45 pm - Keshav Edoofa: In simple words Keysha and Mrs. Annie what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well. 

However as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her counselling, eligibility check stage and is thorough throughout the evaluation, then they surely are rewarded with higher quantum of scholarship after which the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, now this , and even *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
30/01/24, 3:46 pm - +263 77 315 6876: Wow this is great
30/01/24, 3:47 pm - +263 77 315 6876: And i will try and make her answer attend all the meetings in time
30/01/24, 3:47 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Sure Mrs. Annie
30/01/24, 3:48 pm - +263 77 315 6876: Greatly appreciated 👏🏻
30/01/24, 3:48 pm - Keshav Edoofa: So now shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?
30/01/24, 3:49 pm - +263 77 315 6876: Yes all ears
30/01/24, 3:52 pm - Keshav Edoofa: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in
30/01/24, 3:52 pm - Keshav Edoofa: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

*1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-_*Africa Global Radio*_ - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

-_*Skooqs*_ - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
30/01/24, 3:52 pm - Keshav Edoofa: *2. Recruitment Partners: -*

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
30/01/24, 3:52 pm - Keshav Edoofa: *3. Webinars: -*

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -

30/01/24, 3:52 pm - Keshav Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase. 

*What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit Keysha?*
30/01/24, 3:56 pm - +263 77 315 6876: Sounds interesting and doable
30/01/24, 3:57 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I am delighted to hear that Mrs. Annie, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
30/01/24, 4:00 pm - +263 77 315 6876: Yes this will benefit her a lot and makes her grow business wise 
 This is good foundation in her career
30/01/24, 4:02 pm - +263 77 315 6876: Ok i get it i am sure she can accomplish this 
She is so eager to excel 
I trust her to work hard with no doubt
30/01/24, 4:03 pm - +263 77 315 6876: She is one strong-willed young lady
30/01/24, 4:07 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Excellent Mrs. Annie, I must say you both are amazing in your responses this will definitely be taken into account for your quantum of scholarship and eligibility
30/01/24, 4:07 pm - Keshav Edoofa: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.
30/01/24, 4:07 pm - +263 78 117 3528: Yesss I think this will benefit 100%

30/01/24, 4:08 pm - Keshav Edoofa: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
30/01/24, 4:13 pm - +263 77 315 6876: Much appreciated 🙏
30/01/24, 4:13 pm - +263 78 117 3528: Surely it is the best Program
30/01/24, 4:14 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
30/01/24, 4:15 pm - +263 77 315 6876: Wow some even earn this much 
Incredible 👏🏻👏🏻
30/01/24, 4:15 pm - +263 78 117 3528: Yes
30/01/24, 4:16 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Absolutely
30/01/24, 4:16 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Keysha as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
30/01/24, 4:16 pm - +263 77 315 6876: Yes so different i must confess 
Getting the best education whilst earning .I love this <This message was edited>
30/01/24, 4:17 pm - +263 77 315 6876: Yes i am ready
30/01/24, 4:17 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I am delighted
30/01/24, 4:18 pm - +263 77 315 6876: Approximately $1500 to $2000
30/01/24, 4:18 pm - +263 78 117 3528: That would be nearly $2000
30/01/24, 4:19 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Exactly and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
30/01/24, 4:19 pm - +263 77 315 6876: That’s a lot of money
30/01/24, 4:19 pm - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>
30/01/24, 4:19 pm - Keshav Edoofa: *But, as we know the COVID-19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
30/01/24, 4:19 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Exactly Mrs. Annie
30/01/24, 4:20 pm - +263 77 315 6876: Ok noted
30/01/24, 4:21 pm - +263 78 117 3528: So there’s benefits for early admissions as well
30/01/24, 4:21 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Yes Keysha!
30/01/24, 4:22 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university zapplications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
30/01/24, 4:22 pm - +263 77 315 6876: So if you pay the fee is the admission guaranteed ??
30/01/24, 4:23 pm - +263 77 315 6876: Yeah its less hustle
30/01/24, 4:24 pm - Keshav Edoofa: yes Mrs. Annie admission will be guaranteed with minimum of 50% of scholarship
30/01/24, 4:24 pm - +263 77 315 6876: Ok noted
30/01/24, 4:24 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
30/01/24, 4:24 pm - +263 78 117 3528: Yes I think so
30/01/24, 4:25 pm - Keshav Edoofa: You see Edoofa's exceptional program has opened up a world of opportunities for aspiring students, garnering thousands of applications on a daily basis. The Eligibility Evaluation process ensures that deserving candidates are granted the chance to participate in the program. *Once accepted, students are requested to pay a nominal Program Fee of $350 within 7 days of receiving their acceptance letter*, following which they commence with their admission process and the esteemed Earn While You Learn Program. Edoofa's mission to provide quality education and support to students is at the heart of this initiative, and we are honored to make a difference in the lives of deserving individuals through this program.
30/01/24, 4:25 pm - Keshav Edoofa: However Keysha and Mrs. Annie, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
30/01/24, 4:29 pm - +263 77 315 6876: Ok this is convenient for us
30/01/24, 4:29 pm - Keshav Edoofa: From your response I can see you did understand the financial aspect of the Edoofa Program quite well Mrs.Annie and Keysha, however I hope that you have understood how it totally depends upon the student to make his/her higher education affordable with the help of the Earn While You Learn Program's Scholarship Credits?
30/01/24, 4:31 pm - +263 77 315 6876: Yes i have understood the whole concept 
The EWYLP is the way to go
30/01/24, 4:31 pm - +263 77 315 6876: I am sure she can multitask
30/01/24, 4:32 pm - Keshav Edoofa: That is the spirit, Bravo!
30/01/24, 4:32 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.
30/01/24, 4:32 pm - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>
30/01/24, 4:32 pm - +263 78 117 3528: Yes I have understood and as I have said earlier on I can multitask and work extra hard
30/01/24, 4:33 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Alright Keysha and Mrs. Annie, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zimbabwe itself.
30/01/24, 4:33 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
30/01/24, 4:33 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Wonderful spirit i must say!
30/01/24, 4:34 pm - +263 78 117 3528: Yes I understand very well
30/01/24, 4:35 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of the registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
30/01/24, 4:35 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Basically, this registration fee will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August/September 2024 and the remaining in January next year 2025.
30/01/24, 4:35 pm - Keshav Edoofa: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*

Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage.
If a person suddenly encounters any terrible danger, the change of nature one undergoes is equally great. Sometimes fear numbs our senses. Like animals, one stands still, powerless to move a step in fright or to lift a hand in defense of our lives, and sometimes one is seized with panic, and again, act more like the inferior animals than rational beings. On the other hand, frequently in cases of sudden extreme peril, which cannot be escaped by flight, and must be instantly faced, even the most timid men at once as if by miracle, become possessed of the necessary courage, sharp quick apprehension and swift decision. This is a miracle very common in nature. Man and the inferior animals alike, when confronted with almost certain death ‘ gather resolution from despair’ but there can really be no trace of so debilitating a feeling in the person fighting, or prepared to fight for dear life. At such times the mind is clearer than it has ever been; the nerves are steel, there is nothing felt but a wonderful strength and daring. Looking back at certain perilous moments in my own life, I remember them with a kind of joy, not that there was any joyful excitement then, but because they broadened my horizon, lifted me for a time above myself.

Whey to Go Greek yogurt—a strained form of cultured yogurt—has grown enormously in popularity in the United States since it was first introduced in the country in the late 1980s. From 2011 to 2012 alone, sales of Greek yogurt in the US increased by 50 percent. The resulting increase in Greek yogurt production has forced those involved in the business to address the detrimental effects that the yogurt-making process may be having on the environment. Fortunately, farmers and others in the Greek yogurt business have found many methods of controlling and eliminating most environmental threats. Given these solutions as well as the many health benefits of the food, the advantages of Greek yogurt Q5. outdo the potential drawbacks of its production.Sentence [1] The main environmental problem caused by the production of Greek yogurt is the creation of acid whey as a by-product.Sentence [2] Because it requires up to four times more milk to make than conventional yogurt does, Greek yogurt produces larger amounts of acid whey, which is difficult to dispose of.Sentence [3] To address the problem of disposal, farmers have found a number of uses for acid whey. Sentence[4] They can add it to livestock feed as a protein Q.6. supplement and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt. Sentence[5] If it is improperly introduced into the environment, acid-whey runoff Q.7. can pollute waterways, depleting the oxygen content of streams and rivers as it decomposes. Sentence [6] Yogurt manufacturers, food Q.8. scientists; and government officials are also working together to develop additional solutions for reusing whey.

31/01/24, 2:33 pm - +263 78 117 3528: SECTION 5
The Genocide against the Tutsi affected the country at large .The survivors years later were presented with more symptoms of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD),despair along with death because of the brutality attacks and violence they witnessed throughout the period of the genocide .It even affected the descendants because many buildings were destroyed and millions of peope had to move from their matrimonials home.Many women suffered rape and sexual abuse during this time which led to pregnancy.Thousands of children were orphaned
No crime is more human or inhumane than genocide
  
Despite this setback in the last decades Rwandans have come a long way on the bumpy road to reconciliation but still haunted by genocidal past .
Regardless of the Civil war the Country has witnessed an economic boom which improved the living standards of many Rwandans .This happened after the most iconic woman leader, the late Aloisea Inyumba took it upon herself to reconstruct the country.She took a national listening tour and devised programs to rebuild her country 

Contemporary ,the country faces many challenges like high unemployment rates.
Asides the horrific genocide that devastated the country through my research,i can safely say today we can see people living side by side, working together.
To add on ,the heart of Africa has become the most visited country over the years because of their tourist attractions.It is a beautiful clean country with a pleasant climate and diverse landscapes, including volcanoes, mountains, rainforests, and lakes.

To summarise Rwanda is generally considered a safe place for both Rwandans & Tourist.The Rwandan government uses the police force and security services to tightly control the territory every neighborhood is patrolled by security at night, and as such, your safety is guaranteed wherever you might choose to live during your stay here because level of crime is now very low.They are now enjoying their political stability and general security, low levels of corruption with liberal legal frameworks in place
The economy continued to achieve strong growth in 2022 .The country is one of the leading producers of coffee so it is now known for its strong coffee culture 

Not only Rwanda is peaceful and developing ,it is is also among the top contributors of UN peacekeeping personnel, contributing to global and regional peace-building efforts.
The health sector has improved by implementing  access to affordable health services that have expanded through the introduction of community-based health insurance. 
Reconciliation has enabled Rwandans to close a chapter of their history and write a new one .They rose from ashes and these positive walk have truly impressed the world•


SECTION 6
Growing up as a girl child surrounded by strong powerful women and it shaped me into a hardworking young girl ,well it’s shaping me .Brought up in a a community where everyone is loving and caring and everyone cares for everyone and this has had a significant impact on my life and it has led me to be one person who is caring and loving and also help people.Skipping to my academics up until A level it was very difficult .Specifically my. lower 6and upper 6 grade those were the most difficult stages of my academic journey so far .At some point I almost gave up cause at one time I greatly ,rock bottom failed .At that time I watched my dream of being a chartered accountant slip over my fingers but my guardians they were there ,they put confidence in me and they trusted that I would pass my Advanced level.That is when I started working twice as hard .I started working hard and also working on my emotional stability and not to ever be demotivated  .To add on I would listen to motivational podcasts ,they helped a lot .I started believing in myself again and it led to me realise that if I work hard I can get anything if I work hard  .Back at my former school the headmaster there would always tell us that the sky is the limit and I always wondered what he meant by that .I then decided to rephrase it and just told myself that I can do anything that I have set my mind on doing and there will always be people who will be there and they will help me out in any way they can .To add on my biggest weakness is that I can give too much attention or focus to one thing and neglect the other things ,but I can safely say that Iam working on it and am improving grately and as you can on my result slip for Advanced level that my grades were not that spaced or different they were closer to each other which has assured me that I can multitask and also I can see it on my day to day running activities.Also I can work under any pressure.Circling back to my to the person who motivates me the most my aunt .She’s kinda the backbone of why I chose the route of accounting.In high school when i was stuck with my accounting questions for instance costing at first it was a bit challenging when I went to her for help,she would explain it to me in the way that I would understand.I would see how passionate she was and I will wanted to and still want to be that good in accounting for the both us .For her and I .I can safely say that Iam determined to be someone who’s going to touch the hearts of many whilst using my creativeness,proactiveness and the resources that will be laid down for me by my guardians and those around me who would like to help me throughout my academic journey .As I was a leader or prefect i may say  for almost throughout my whole primary ,secondary and high school period .I have known and learnt how to deal with different kinds of other pupils my age and this has helped me to have emotional stability and be a shock absorber .I  have learnt to deal with certain situations with utmost thinking and also Iam a quick thinker .
To add on am resourceful and very creative .
31/01/24, 2:36 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Fantastic Keysha, I must appreciate how sincerely you have answered every question of the test, Brillant!
Kudos to you!
31/01/24, 2:37 pm - +263 78 117 3528: Thank you so much
31/01/24, 2:37 pm - Keshav Edoofa: While I get your test evaluated, I have your interview slots, however before I shared the interview slots I would like you and Mrs. Annie as well to answer a few of my questions.

So I wanted to ask that for the same, so could you and Mrs. Annie @263773156876 be online for the next 20 minutes to answer my question
31/01/24, 2:39 pm - +263 78 117 3528: Okay
31/01/24, 2:39 pm - +263 77 315 6876: Ok
31/01/24, 2:39 pm - +263 77 315 6876: Wow this is long i will read it soon
31/01/24, 2:42 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Mrs. Annie, you see as per my experience over the last couple of years, I have been fortunate to have assisted over hundreds of students in achieving their career aspiration through the Edoofa Program. 

One of my key observations during helping out these students was regarding what was the common trait amongst students who are today having the best of their time in India through the Edoofa Program, and honestly I was able to come down to only one aspect that is FAMILY SUPPORT.
31/01/24, 2:42 pm - Keshav Edoofa: You see in this journey of any child's higher education, there are three major contributors 

1. Student himself/herself
2. FAMILY
3. EDOOFA PROGAM

Now all the students who are today successfully a part of the Edoofa Program, had all these three contributors working together towards the common goal which is student's success and ensuring that by the time student completes his/her higher education they should be able to get good paying jobs. 

Even if any one of the contributor does not perform to the best of their abilities, Student's overall success is hampered. Let me give you a few examples

*In the event if student wishes to work hard, Edoofa is willing to support but the Family is not willing to support, the student will not be successful under the program*

*In the event if student wishes to work hard, Family is willing to support, but Edoofa's academic Board doesn't find the student worthy, the student will not be successful under the program*

*In the event if Family is willing to support, Edoofa's Academic Board is willing to support but the student doesn't wishes to work hard, then also the student will not be successful under the program*
31/01/24, 2:43 pm - Keshav Edoofa: During the evaluation of your child's application so far, the Academic Board has evaluated a few aspects, such as student's willingness to work hard, and family's willingness to support the student so that the student can achieve what he/she has aspired.

05/02/24, 1:42 pm - Keshav Edoofa: That's right Keysha your EWYL program will be started soon after your enrollment into Edoofa as we give students a chance to reduce their fees even before they enter the university and utilize their time well!
05/02/24, 1:43 pm - +263 78 117 3528: Okay I now understand better
05/02/24, 1:43 pm - +263 78 117 3528: Thank you Mr Keshav
05/02/24, 1:44 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Is there anything you or Mrs. Annie @263773156876 would like to ask?
05/02/24, 1:46 pm - +263 77 315 6876: So when do we know the university she will attend
05/02/24, 1:47 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Once you complete the enrollment formalities, your application will be handed over to our admissions team and there you will be clarified regarding the further course of action
05/02/24, 1:57 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I hope you both have a better understanding now?
05/02/24, 2:23 pm - +263 77 315 6876: Ok understood now
05/02/24, 2:34 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Alright @263773156876 @263781173528 , so as you must have seen, there are two modes of fee payments mentioned:-

1. Direct Bank Transfer to our Parent Company's account
2. Deposit in our associate's account over there in Zimbabwe

Which mode according to you would be convenient, so that I can brief you in-depth about that particular mode?
Or shall i explain you both the methods?
05/02/24, 2:36 pm - +263 77 315 6876: I have read and understood 
The first option which method of transfer do we use ??
05/02/24, 2:37 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Talking about the first mode, which is the Direct Bank transfer in our Account, basically because of the cash crisis in Zimbabwe, there are a limited Banks which allow International Transfer. These Banks are Barclays Bank and CBZ Bank, Nedbank and FBC Bank. If you have an account in any of these Banks then the transaction charges will then be $100 to $120 USD for any amount upto $1000 depending upon the bank. Please note that $350 should also be in USD. In case you have Zimbabwean Dollars, you will have to exchange that with USD and transfer charges on *every transaction* would also be $100 to $120.

Therefore, the Bank Details that are to be used in this mode are:

Swift code: AXISINBB207
IFSC code: UTIB0001147
Bank Name: Axis Bank Ltd.
Account Name: Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd.
Current Account Number: 917020070183626
Bank's Name:  Axis Bank Ltd.
Bank’s Address: Janakpuri, B Block, New Delhi[DL]
Ground Floor & Basement, B-1/503, Janakpuri, New Delhi 110058
05/02/24, 2:37 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Since in the first mode, the Direct Bank Transfer Mode, the transfer charges which are to be borne by the parents of the student ranges between $100 to $120 which become quite high for a lot of parents considering the economic situation in Zimbabwe itself. So as not every student is in a position to cater for an additional $100 to $120 just as transfer charge, the second mode was introduced, wherein, it is the Bank deposit in Mr. Charles's Account, in this the transfer charges get divided amongst 10 students resulting in an equivalent bearing of 12.5% at the end.

So as you can see in the letter that there is a Bank deposit in, Mr. Charles Jerera (Retired Education Officer)'s account as he is our Associated Partner there in Zimbabwe, Since 2020 there have been over 1400+ students who have been assisted by Mr Charles inorder to complete their enrollment formalities as well as university fee payments after arriving in India.
05/02/24, 2:37 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Therefore the fee can also be paid through him. Since his account is a NOSTRO Account which only holds USD itself, therefore the necessary amount including the transfer charges in this mode itself would be $394 ($350 + $44 transfer charges), and the same details are as below:-

BANK NAME: FBC
