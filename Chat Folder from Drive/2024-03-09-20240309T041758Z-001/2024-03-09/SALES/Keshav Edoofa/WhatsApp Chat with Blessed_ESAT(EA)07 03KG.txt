08/03/24, 10:20 am - Keshav Edoofa: Dear Parent and Student, we understand you have gone through the Brochures and Flyers of the Edoofa Program.
To emphasize  *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and has been rewarding meritorious students to lower their Fee Structure less than what you will end up paying at the Local Zimbabwe University.
08/03/24, 12:58 pm - +263 78 073 7446: So how can manage to be fully involved in getting the scholarship . We really need to also know the terms and conditions you also offer
08/03/24, 1:44 pm - Keshav Edoofa: May I know the good names of your parents please, blessed @263780737446 ?
08/03/24, 1:52 pm - +263 73 370 6704: Good  Afternoon, Mr Brian  Mutede (father) Mrs Jessica Mutede (Mother)
08/03/24, 1:57 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Good afternoon Mr. Brian and Mrs. Jessica 
How are you, please?
08/03/24, 2:03 pm - +263 73 370 6704: Good afternoon, How are you.
08/03/24, 2:05 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I am well Mr. Brian
08/03/24, 2:07 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Okay so @263780737446 @263733706704 @263777203347 @263777449863 , as we start discussing your results further, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 


Qualification to the ESAT Exam (Please note EDOOFA calculates your results based on the TOP performers' Score so it is the percentile that we will be evaluating on)
A Level and Previous Results 
*Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 
*Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling.
Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these Four significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
08/03/24, 2:11 pm - +263 73 370 6704: Yes we do
08/03/24, 2:14 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Great then Mr. Brian
