07/03/24, 2:00 pm - Keshav Edoofa: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
07/03/24, 2:00 pm - Keshav Edoofa: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
07/03/24, 2:00 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.

07/03/24, 2:00 pm - Keshav Edoofa: It is with great pride that i would like to share with you that, recently we hosted a special conference for our Edoofians studying in India,  *SLICE - CON'24 - Symposium of Leaders, Innovators and Creators with Edoofa*, The students embarked on an enlightening industrial visit, immersing themselves in dynamic interactions with our esteemed Founders, CEOs, and visionary entrepreneurs. This is one of the many benefits of the Edoofa Scholarship Program and have a look at the glimpses of this auspicious 3 day event.
07/03/24, 2:05 pm - +263 78 347 6488: ok thank you for the update.
Understood
07/03/24, 2:06 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
07/03/24, 2:07 pm - +263 78 347 6488: that's very correct sir.
07/03/24, 2:08 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Okay so @263783476488 @263772460994 , as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
07/03/24, 2:11 pm - +263 78 347 6488: Unfortunately Mr Keshav... My mother isn't able to make it for the session due to network issues especially at this time of the day
07/03/24, 2:13 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Its Alright I understand the network challenges, I would like to tell that Mrs. Netsai can keep a follow up of the session whenever she is available!
07/03/24, 2:15 pm - +263 78 347 6488: ok well in that case l am surely have what it takes to meet the 2 significant metrics and got a desired scholarship
07/03/24, 2:15 pm - Keshav Edoofa: That is the spirit, great!
07/03/24, 2:16 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Alright so @263783476488 , now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.

I would like to know you better as a student, so please go ahead, and tell me a bit about yourself, your education, what you wish to study, your strengths, your weaknesses, your hobbies, and a detailed description of your family background, *Where do your parents work (Place) in your country or any other country that they have relocated to due to work promises?  Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work) since I honestly don't know a lot about you?*
07/03/24, 2:31 pm - +263 78 347 6488: Ok so as mentioned above my birth name is Wanatsaishe Chingoto.

 l am a former student of St Patricks High school located in Gweru, Zimbabwe.

08/03/24, 9:41 am - +263 78 347 6488: good morning
08/03/24, 10:37 am - Keshav Edoofa: Hello @263783476488 @263772460994 , Good Morning, Hope you are doing well

As discussed, I am here for us to continue with your application, so shall we start?
08/03/24, 10:38 am - +263 78 347 6488: yes we may begin
08/03/24, 11:07 am - Keshav Edoofa: So are you interested in Mining engineering?
08/03/24, 11:08 am - +263 78 347 6488: yes sir
08/03/24, 11:22 am - Keshav Edoofa: I understand what you are sharing Wanatsaishe!
08/03/24, 11:22 am - Keshav Edoofa: But you see, Mining engineering is a field of engineering that is concerned with the extraction and processing of minerals from the earth. It is a field that has been around for centuries and is currently experiencing a resurgence due to the increased demand for materials such as metals, minerals, and oil. However, due to the changing nature of the world’s economy, it is unclear whether mining engineering will remain a viable field of study and profession 10 years down the line. 

One of the primary reasons why mining engineering may not be successful 10 years down the line is the increasing shift towards renewable energy sources. With the world’s reliance on fossil fuels decreasing, there is less need for the materials that mining engineers specialize in extracting and processing. Furthermore, the increasing focus on environmental conservation has also contributed to this shift, as the extraction of minerals and materials can often have a negative impact on the environment. 

In addition, the advancement of technology in other engineering fields such as computer science and mechanical engineering may also lead to the decreased relevance of mining engineering. As technology improves, these other fields are becoming more efficient and effective in the development of new products and services. This increased efficiency and effectiveness can lead to a decrease in the demand for materials that are extracted and processed by mining engineers. 

Finally, the increasing cost of labor may also be a factor in the decreased relevance of mining engineering 10 years down the line. As the cost of labor increases, it becomes more difficult for mining companies to remain profitable. This can lead to mining companies cutting back on labor costs, which can reduce the demand for mining engineers and other professionals in the field. 

In conclusion, mining engineering may not be successful 10 years down the line due to the increasing shift towards renewable energy sources, the advancement of technology in other engineering fields, and the increasing cost of labor. As a result, mining engineers may need to look for other opportunities in order to remain relevant and successful in the future.
08/03/24, 11:55 am - +263 78 347 6488: l understand stand Mr Keshav and thanks for the information. 
ln that case my first alternative would be to study environmental engineering
08/03/24, 12:05 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Seee Wanatsaishe as I exlained that advancement of technology in other engineering fields such as computer science and mechanical engineering may also lead to the decreased relevance of mining engineering and now I want to ask you what will be the alternative for the Mineral and fuel energies in the future?
08/03/24, 12:14 pm - +263 78 347 6488: As for fuel energies l want to believe they are alternated by natural sources like the Sun.
And to minerals l am not sure but l want to guess they are reused
08/03/24, 12:17 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Well I would like to tell you that in future due to technology and for pollution free environment electric energies are the alternative!
Isnt it? <This message was edited>
08/03/24, 12:18 pm - +263 78 347 6488: oh yes it is😅
08/03/24, 12:22 pm - Keshav Edoofa: So in such a scenario globally electrical engineering and electronics engineering are going to boom and flourish as from my experience in the education field for so many years I can confidently say environmental, mining, metallurgical engineering etc are going to be replaced by engineering branches like electrical, electronics, computer science, mechanical in terms of scope and opportunities!

Dont you agree with me?
08/03/24, 3:30 pm - +263 78 347 6488: oh l do agree with you sir
08/03/24, 3:34 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Therefore ,I shall recommend you the course *Diploma in Electrical Engineering*
08/03/24, 4:23 pm - +263 78 347 6488: ok sir, let me say l would really appreciate that honor
08/03/24, 4:41 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Well, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you *tomorrow again at 9:30 AM CAT* to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind.
