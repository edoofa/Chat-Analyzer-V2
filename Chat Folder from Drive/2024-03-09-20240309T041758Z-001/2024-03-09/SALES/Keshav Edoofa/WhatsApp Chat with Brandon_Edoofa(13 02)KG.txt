20/02/24, 10:11 am - Keshav Edoofa: Let me further Elaborate about Edoofa Scholarship program to you
20/02/24, 10:11 am - Keshav Edoofa: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
20/02/24, 10:11 am - Keshav Edoofa: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
20/02/24, 10:11 am - Keshav Edoofa: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
20/02/24, 10:11 am - Keshav Edoofa: It is with great pride that i would like to share with you that, recently we hosted a special conference for our Edoofians studying in India,  *SLICE - CON'24 - Symposium of Leaders, Innovators and Creators with Edoofa*, The students embarked on an enlightening industrial visit, immersing themselves in dynamic interactions with our esteemed Founders, CEOs, and visionary entrepreneurs. This is one of the many benefits of the Edoofa Scholarship Program and have a look at the glimpses of this auspicious 3 day event.
20/02/24, 10:11 am - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>
20/02/24, 11:19 am - +263 77 633 8363: okay sir so you provide accomodation for your students or they handle it alone
20/02/24, 11:21 am - Keshav Edoofa: All these details will be well covered ahead Brandon!
20/02/24, 11:21 am - Keshav Edoofa: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
20/02/24, 11:21 am - +263 77 633 8363: Okay sorry for the rush
20/02/24, 11:22 am - +263 77 633 8363: Yes that is my goal, to reduce burden on my parents
20/02/24, 11:24 am - Keshav Edoofa: Okay so Brandon, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.
20/02/24, 11:28 am - +263 77 633 8363: Thank you for the advice lm going to follow it and achieve higher quantum of scholarship
20/02/24, 11:41 am - +263 77 633 8363: Thank you, lm assured that this is legit.

27/02/24, 4:04 pm - +263 77 633 8363: Okay sir
27/02/24, 4:04 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I hope you must have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead. As of now would you like to ask anything so far?
27/02/24, 4:06 pm - +263 77 633 8363: No sir, questions are answered .
27/02/24, 4:07 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Alright then lets proceed ahead!
27/02/24, 4:09 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
27/02/24, 4:09 pm - Keshav Edoofa: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
27/02/24, 4:09 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
27/02/24, 4:09 pm - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>
27/02/24, 4:09 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
27/02/24, 4:16 pm - +263 77 633 8363: Okay sir that really helps a lot
27/02/24, 4:17 pm - +263 77 633 8363: What is the Earn while you learn program sir?
28/02/24, 8:22 am - Keshav Edoofa: Good Morning @263776338363 @263733716105 @263775336758
28/02/24, 8:22 am - Keshav Edoofa: I hope you are doing well!
28/02/24, 8:43 am - +263 77 633 8363: lm fine and you sir
28/02/24, 8:49 am - +263 77 533 6758: <Media omitted>
28/02/24, 8:50 am - +263 77 533 6758: <Media omitted>
28/02/24, 9:06 am - Keshav Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the results @263776338363 @263775336758
28/02/24, 9:08 am - Keshav Edoofa: In simple words Brandon what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well. 

However as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her counselling, eligibility check stage and is thorough throughout the evaluation, then they surely are rewarded with higher quantum of scholarship after which the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1200-$1800, now this , and even *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
28/02/24, 11:21 am - +263 77 633 8363: Okay sir
28/02/24, 11:22 am - Keshav Edoofa: Shall i brief you regarding the EWYL program then?
28/02/24, 11:25 am - +263 77 633 8363: Yes sir may you please elaborate briefly
28/02/24, 11:27 am - Keshav Edoofa: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in
28/02/24, 11:27 am - Keshav Edoofa: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

*1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-_*Africa Global Radio*_ - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

-_*Skooqs*_ - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
28/02/24, 11:27 am - Keshav Edoofa: *2. Recruitment Partners: -*

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
28/02/24, 11:27 am - Keshav Edoofa: *3. Webinars: -*

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
_Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world_ by *Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade*.

28/02/24, 11:27 am - Keshav Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase. 

*What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
28/02/24, 11:34 am - +263 77 633 8363: The program will be very helpful and it will benefit me as it give me skills and the ability to support me financially
28/02/24, 11:35 am - Keshav Edoofa: I am delighted to hear that @263776338363 , moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
28/02/24, 11:38 am - +263 77 633 8363: This program is really good sir, this will help a lot.
28/02/24, 11:38 am - Keshav Edoofa: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

28/02/24, 11:39 am - Keshav Edoofa: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
28/02/24, 11:42 am - +263 77 633 8363: lm very glad to know this program sir because it will help regardless of my status.
28/02/24, 11:50 am - Keshav Edoofa: Did you understand about the aspects of the EWYL program and the benefits it entails?@263776338363 !@263733716105 @263775336758 ?
28/02/24, 11:51 am - +263 77 633 8363: Yes, l understood very much.
28/02/24, 11:55 am - Keshav Edoofa: I hope your parents are keeping a followup on your session @263776338363 ?
28/02/24, 11:57 am - +263 77 633 8363: There will follow up. l guess there are busy because mom is at home, dad is at work and lm at school.
28/02/24, 11:58 am - Keshav Edoofa: Alright they can go through the session and information once they are available!
28/02/24, 11:59 am - Keshav Edoofa: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
28/02/24, 1:16 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I was expecting your response @263733716105 @263775336758
28/02/24, 1:28 pm - +263 77 633 8363: Okay sir
28/02/24, 1:30 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Brandon as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
28/02/24, 1:33 pm - +263 77 633 8363: This message was deleted
28/02/24, 1:34 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Exactly Brandon, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
28/02/24, 1:34 pm - +263 77 633 8363: $1500-$2250
28/02/24, 1:34 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Exactly Brandon and it is not affordable right?
28/02/24, 1:35 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Hence here comes Edoofa with its benefits!
28/02/24, 1:36 pm - +263 77 633 8363: Okay sir so this fee is apart from the annual fee
28/02/24, 1:37 pm - +263 77 633 8363: The program is very helpful sir.
28/02/24, 1:37 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I shall clarify this for you as well however before that, i shall explain yet another super benefit
28/02/24, 1:38 pm - +263 77 633 8363: Okay
28/02/24, 1:38 pm - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>
28/02/24, 1:38 pm - Keshav Edoofa: So you even won't be paying 750$ now instead only 350$
28/02/24, 1:40 pm - +263 77 633 8363: Okay sir that is really good
28/02/24, 1:41 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university zapplications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
28/02/24, 1:43 pm - +263 77 633 8363: l do sir
28/02/24, 1:44 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
28/02/24, 1:44 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Brandon basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
28/02/24, 1:44 pm - Keshav Edoofa: However Brandon, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
28/02/24, 1:47 pm - +263 77 633 8363: Okay
28/02/24, 1:48 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Yes Brandon and I hope that you have understood how it totally depends upon the student to make his/her higher education affordable with the help of the Earn While You Learn Program's Scholarship Credits?
28/02/24, 1:49 pm - +263 77 633 8363: Yes l understood the program is very important to me sir and would like to participate in it
28/02/24, 1:49 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I am glad to hear that @263776338363
28/02/24, 1:50 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Before we conclude our session with the explanation of Edoofa cycle I want you to look at this video!
28/02/24, 1:50 pm - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>
28/02/24, 1:58 pm - +263 77 633 8363: The students look really happy. This program improves the future of many students and that is wonderful sir and would love to be part of it.
28/02/24, 1:58 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I am glad you could understand what I intended to share with you so that I can help you and guide you to secure maximum scholarship for your education and you do wonders ahead!
28/02/24, 2:00 pm - +263 77 633 8363: l promise you sir,  l will do my best and achieve higher in future
28/02/24, 2:01 pm - Keshav Edoofa: That is the spirit Brandon, kudos
28/02/24, 2:01 pm - Keshav Edoofa: This message was deleted
28/02/24, 2:02 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and en
roll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.

Are you familiar with the Edoofa Cycle?
28/02/24, 2:07 pm - +263 77 633 8363: No, please may you briefly elaborate sir
28/02/24, 2:08 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
28/02/24, 2:08 pm - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>
28/02/24, 2:10 pm - +263 77 633 8363: Okay
28/02/24, 2:11 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Alright Brandon, as you can see, we are currently at Step 1. After this step, you will proceed to Step 2. If you successfully pass Step 2, you will receive your Acceptance Letter from the Edoofa Academic Board in Step 3. After that, as shown in the image above, the completion of your Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4.

Upon completing your formalities, in Step 5: we will initiate your Edoofa Admission Process and your Earn While You Learn Program. We will assign your complete application to our Admission Officers and the Head Coach of the Earn While You Learn Program.

The Admission Officers will be responsible for assisting you with all the required admission documentation that we discussed earlier, including the Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendation, and the completion of applications in all of Edoofa’s Associated Universities, etc.

The Head Coach will be responsible for assigning your application to the Earn While You Learn Program Mentor, who will then evaluate your candidature and assist with projects and assignments throughout your journey with the Edoofa Program.
28/02/24, 2:12 pm - Keshav Edoofa: As an organization that has positively impacted the lives of tens of thousands of African students, we understand that over 97% of parents face financial challenges when planning for their child’s tertiary education. In fact, it is one of the most prominent fears because of which there are parents who despite understanding the kind of growth their child would get through international education, still opt for their children to study in their home country.

Now in our quest to overcome this challenge, I would like to inform you that in Stage 5, while our Admission officers assist with all the necessary admission-related documentation, Edoofa’s Financial Planning team will connect with your parents to help them plan finances for your higher education.

Since in the majority of African nations inflation is a real challenge, keeping in mind that the cost of living in your home country increases atleast by 20% year on year, Financial Planning officers will be responsible for helping your parents plan for your tertiary education in a way that ensures they are not burdened financially throughout your education. Financial planning would include the following aspects:-
*Budgeting for your higher education, as per your parent's affordability.*
*Supporting your parents in building your tertiary education fund.*
28/02/24, 2:12 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I hope you now have an in-depth understanding of what happens in Stage 5 of your Edoofa Cycle?
28/02/24, 2:16 pm - +263 77 633 8363: Yes sir l understood
28/02/24, 2:16 pm - Keshav Edoofa: In Step 6: Once the Financial Planning Team assists your parents in budgeting for your higher education, moving forward you will receive offer letters from the universities where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to complete the required registration process,  as well as finalizing the University. *In order to reserve your seat in any particular University chosen by you a registration fee would have to be paid which would be adjusted through your budgeting done in Stage 5 of the Edoofa Cycle.*

*NOTE:- The registration fee adjusted is not an additional cost, rather it is a part of your first year’s annual fee*
28/02/24, 2:16 pm - Keshav Edoofa: *After a few weeks of your registration process, you will be given your Final Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL), which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
28/02/24, 2:16 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Here is a picture of the Visa of one of the Edoofian who arrived in India, for 2023 Academic Intake on 31st July 2023.
28/02/24, 2:16 pm - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>
28/02/24, 2:18 pm - +263 77 633 8363: Okay sir
28/02/24, 2:19 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Okay so with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check, I want to ask if is there anything you would like me to address?

I hope Mrs @263733716105 @263775336758 you will keep a follow-up on counseling session!?

29/02/24, 2:50 pm - +263 77 533 6758: Afternoon ,yes we discussed.
29/02/24, 2:52 pm - Keshav Edoofa: May I know how was your discussion?
29/02/24, 2:52 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Is there anything you need some more clarification on? <This message was edited>
29/02/24, 3:00 pm - +263 77 533 6758: On payments of fees.
29/02/24, 3:00 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Yeah Sure Kindly ask Mr. Martini!
29/02/24, 3:04 pm - +263 77 533 6758: Let's say if you accept him as a student  how much are the fees.
29/02/24, 3:06 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Referring to this image let me re-explain the financial aspect of the program in 3 parts.

1. The Enrollment fee is $350 which includes application forms, statement of purpose, letter of recommendation, visa assistance, Earn While You Learn Program's training etc.

2. The Registration fee would be between $500-$1000, basically if you recall I did brief you after your university interaction with multiple universities, you would have to reserve your seat in 1 particular university you would have to pay a registration fee. Now usually Registration fee for a student is a separate expense altogether, however for an Edoofian it is considered a part of the first year's annual fee.

Say suppose, after the scholarship your fee is $2200, and you are being asked to pay $500 as a registration fee.

Now, being an Edoofa Applicant you have the privilege here of the registration fee being adjusted against your Tuition fee.

Hence the amount of $500 paid as registration fee will be waived off from your Fee and after that, the balance of ($2200-$500=$1700) has to be paid after coming to India in August/September of the year you come in 2 installments. The first part will be $1000 which you will pay in August 2024-25 and the remaining $700 in January 2025-26.

3. The Annual fee after the scholarship as discussed above would be between $2000-$3000, and this would include Accommodation, Food Expenses, and Basic University Expenses such as exam fees, Library Fee, and Lab Fee However if a student is able to clear the Eligibility Check test and Interview with over 90 marks, a student is eligible to get a 90% to 100% scholarship where the Annual fee after the scholarship would be between $1250-$1500, which would include Accommodation, Food Expenses, and Basic University Expenses such as exam fees, Library Fee, and Lab Fee
29/02/24, 3:06 pm - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/02/24, 3:09 pm - Keshav Edoofa: But as for Brandon, I believe he is a brilliant student I am confident he will secure a maximum scholarship if he performs well in the scholarship test that I am about to send him and performs well in the interview his fee would range from 1200-1800$ annually
29/02/24, 3:10 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Even further as you must know he will be provided with the EWYL program where he can reduce his annual fee as much as he can!
29/02/24, 3:23 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I hope you understood well?@263775336758
29/02/24, 3:41 pm - +263 77 533 6758: Now l understand
29/02/24, 3:42 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Alright @263775336758
29/02/24, 3:42 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Anything else, please @263733716105 @263775336758 @263776338363 ?
29/02/24, 3:43 pm - +263 77 533 6758: You can now proceed.
29/02/24, 3:44 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I would like to ask some questions to @263776338363 are you ready Brandon?
29/02/24, 3:46 pm - +263 77 633 8363: Yes sir  lm ready
29/02/24, 3:50 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Okay so , can you tell me:-

2. Through Edoofa in which country would you be pursuing his higher education?

3. What is the average cost for studies in that country without a scholarship?

5. What is the enrollment fee of the Edoofa Program?

7. After receiving your offer letter from the University, you will have to pay your registration fee in order to finalize your university selection and reserve your scholarship seat in a particular university, this registration fee would be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?
29/02/24, 4:18 pm - +263 77 633 8363: Through the help of the Edoofa program  l would like to study the law course mostly based on cooperate law. I would pursue my higher education in the country india and without a scholarship the average cost for studies in india are $6000-$8000 for international students. lf you are found eligible with edoofa progrqm your annual fee would be$2000-$3000 however if you get a 90-100℅ scholarship your annual fee would be $1250-$1500 as mentioned on top. The enrollment fee of the edoofa program is $350. If you are also found eligible you will pay $200 in 7days and $150 within 30days and lm clear about the adjustion of my first registration fee to my first year's annual fee after scholarship.

*_SECTION 2 READING TEST_*

Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage.
If a person suddenly encounters any terrible danger, the change of nature one undergoes is equally great. Sometimes fear numbs our senses. Like animals, one stands still, powerless to move a step in fright or to lift a hand in defense of our lives, and sometimes one is seized with panic, and again, act more like the inferior animals than rational beings. On the other hand, frequently in cases of sudden extreme peril, which cannot be escaped by flight, and must be instantly faced, even the most timid men at once as if by miracle, become possessed of the necessary courage, sharp quick apprehension and swift decision. This is a miracle very common in nature. Man and the inferior animals alike, when confronted with almost certain death ‘ gather resolution from despair’ but there can really be no trace of so debilitating a feeling in the person fighting, or prepared to fight for dear life. At such times the mind is clearer than it has ever been; the nerves are steel, there is nothing felt but a wonderful strength and daring. Looking back at certain perilous moments in my own life, I remember them with a kind of joy, not that there was any joyful excitement then, but because they broadened my horizon, lifted me for a time above myself.

Whey to Go Greek yogurt—a strained form of cultured yogurt—has grown enormously in popularity in the United States since it was first introduced in the country in the late 1980s. From 2011 to 2012 alone, sales of Greek yogurt in the US increased by 50 percent. The resulting increase in Greek yogurt production has forced those involved in the business to address the detrimental effects that the yogurt-making process may be having on the environment. Fortunately, farmers and others in the Greek yogurt business have found many methods of controlling and eliminating most environmental threats. Given these solutions as well as the many health benefits of the food, the advantages of Greek yogurt Q5. outdo the potential drawbacks of its production.Sentence [1] The main environmental problem caused by the production of Greek yogurt is the creation of acid whey as a by-product.Sentence [2] Because it requires up to four times more milk to make than conventional yogurt does, Greek yogurt produces larger amounts of acid whey, which is difficult to dispose of.Sentence [3] To address the problem of disposal, farmers have found a number of uses for acid whey. Sentence[4] They can add it to livestock feed as a protein Q.6. supplement and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt. Sentence[5] If it is improperly introduced into the environment, acid-whey runoff Q.7. can pollute waterways, depleting the oxygen content of streams and rivers as it decomposes.

Life in Rwanda 16 years after the genocide has seen significant progress and transformation, as the country has worked towards reconciliation, healing, and rebuilding. The genocide in 1994, which resulted in the loss of hundreds of thousands of lives and the displacement of many more, had a profound impact on Rwandan society and the nation as a whole. However, Rwanda's journey since then has been marked by resilience, growth, and efforts to overcome the challenges of the past. Here are some key aspects of life in Rwanda 16 years after the genocide:

Reconciliation and Rwanda has made significant strides in promoting reconciliation and unity among its people. National initiatives, memorialization efforts, community dialogues, and justice mechanisms have played a crucial role in fostering a sense of togetherness and healing the wounds of the past.

Economic Development. Rwanda has experienced notable economic development and growth in the years following the genocide. The government has implemented policies to promote investment, entrepreneurship, infrastructure development, and job creation. The country has seen improvements in key sectors such as agriculture, tourism, and information and communication technology (ICT).

Social Reforms. Rwanda has prioritized social reforms aimed at improving healthcare, education, and social welfare for its citizens. Initiatives such as universal health coverage, community health programs, and investments in education have contributed to enhancing the well-being and quality of life for Rwandans.

Political Stability. Rwanda has made strides in establishing political stability and good governance. The country has implemented reforms to combat corruption, promote transparency, and strengthen democratic institutions. The government's emphasis on accountability and effective leadership has contributed to Rwanda's stability and progress.

Women's Empowerment. Rwanda has made significant advances in promoting women's empowerment and gender equality. The country has one of the highest rates of female representation in parliament globally, with women holding key leadership positions in government and various sectors of society.

Infrastructure Development. Rwanda has invested in infrastructure development to enhance connectivity, promote trade, and improve access to services. Investments in roads, bridges, energy, and telecommunications have facilitated economic growth and contributed to the country's development.

Memorialization and Remembrance. Rwanda has established memorials, museums, and educational programs to commemorate the genocide, honor the victims, and educate future generations about the importance of remembrance, unity, and prevention of such atrocities.

Youth Engagement and Education. Rwanda has placed a strong emphasis on youth engagement, education, and skills development. Programs promoting entrepreneurship, innovation, and leadership among youth have helped harness the potential of the younger generation to contribute to the country's growth and development.

Despite the progress made, challenges remain in addressing the legacy of the genocide, promoting social cohesion, and achieving sustainable development. Rwanda continues to work towards overcoming these challenges, building a brighter future, and healing the wounds of the past.

Justice and Reconciliation. Rwanda has pursued a combination of justice mechanisms, including gacaca courts and the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, to address accountability for crimes committed during the genocide. These efforts have been integral to the process of seeking justice, promoting healing, and fostering reconciliation among Rwandans.

Community-Based Initiatives. Grassroots community initiatives, such as peacebuilding programs, trauma-healing workshops, and reconciliation projects, have played a key role in fostering unity, forgiveness, and social cohesion at the local level. These initiatives empower communities to address the legacies of the genocide and work towards collective healing.

Environmental Conservation. Rwanda has implemented various environmental conservation initiatives aimed at preserving its natural resources, promoting sustainability, and mitigating the effects of climate change. Efforts such as reforestation projects, waste management programs, and eco-tourism initiatives underscore the country's commitment to environmental stewardship.

Healthcare Advancements. Rwanda has made significant strides in improving healthcare access and outcomes for its population. Initiatives such as community health insurance schemes, vaccination programs, and investments in healthcare infrastructure have contributed to enhancing the health and well-being of Rwandans.

Education Reforms. The Rwandan government has prioritized education reforms to enhance the quality of schooling, increase literacy rates, and promote lifelong learning. Investments in inclusive education, teacher training, and technology integration have bolstered educational opportunities for children and adults across the country.

Cultural Revitalization. Rwanda has focused on preserving and promoting its rich cultural heritage through cultural festivals, arts programs, traditional music and dance, and heritage preservation efforts. Cultural revitalization initiatives help celebrate Rwanda's diversity, history, and traditions while fostering a sense of national identity and pride.

Innovation and Technology. Rwanda has embraced innovation and technology as drivers of economic growth and social progress. The country has invested in digital infrastructure, ICT skills development, and tech entrepreneurship, establishing itself as a hub for innovation in the region and attracting tech-savvy entrepreneurs and investors.

Regional and Global Engagement. Rwanda has actively engaged in regional and global initiatives, playing a role in peacekeeping missions, economic partnerships, and international cooperation. The country's diplomatic efforts, advocacy for sustainable development, and active participation in multilateral forums have raised Rwanda's profile on the global stage.

Resilience and Hope. Above all, the people of Rwanda have demonstrated remarkable resilience, strength, and hope in the face of adversity. The journey of recovery and transformation following the genocide is a testament to the human spirit's capacity to overcome challenges, forge paths to reconciliation, and build a brighter future for generations to come.

Rwanda's progress 16 years after the genocide reflects a story of resilience, renewal, and determination to move forward from a dark past towards a more prosperous and peaceful future. The country's ongoing efforts in reconciliation, development, and nation-building embody the spirit of unity, healing, and progress that continue to shape Rwanda's journey of recovery and transformation.

Title: "Rising Beyond the Storm: A Journey of Resilience"

In a small town nestled amidst rolling hills, Sarah found herself facing a series of daunting challenges that seemed insurmountable. Struggling with setbacks in her career, health issues, and personal losses, she felt as though the storm clouds of adversity were gathering around her.

Despite the darkness that seemed to envelop her, Sarah refused to surrender to despair. Drawing upon her inner strength and resilience, she embarked on a journey of self-discovery and transformation. With each obstacle she encountered, she chose to see it as an opportunity for growth and learning, a stepping stone towards a brighter future.

In the face of career setbacks, Sarah decided to pursue her passion for writing, a long-held dream she had set aside due to self-doubt and fear of failure. Embracing her creativity and determination, she poured her thoughts, emotions, and experiences onto the page, crafting stories of hope, empowerment, and resilience that resonated with readers around the world.

Amidst her health challenges, Sarah found solace in practicing mindfulness, yoga, and self-care rituals that nurtured her body, mind, and spirit. Through moments of stillness and reflection, she discovered a newfound sense of inner peace and acceptance, allowing her to navigate life's uncertainties with grace and resilience.

In the wake of personal losses, Sarah leaned on the support of loved ones, friends, and a community of kindred spirits who uplifted her, encouraged her, and reminded her of the strength that resided within her. Through their unwavering love and compassion, she found the courage to confront her grief, honor her memories, and embrace the present moment with gratitude and grace.

As the storm clouds began to part and rays of sunlight broke through the darkness, Sarah stood at the threshold of a new chapter in her life. With each trial she had faced, each lesson she had learned, and each step she had taken towards healing and growth, she emerged transformed, resilient, and ready to embrace the journey ahead with renewed hope and unwavering faith in the power of the human spirit to rise above adversity.

"Rising Beyond the Storm" is a testament to the indomitable spirit that resides within each of us, a reminder that even in the darkest of moments, we have the strength, courage, and resilience to weather life's storms and emerge stronger, wiser, and more compassionate than before.

02/03/24, 11:53 am - +263 77 633 8363: Okay will inform them
02/03/24, 11:55 am - Keshav Edoofa: Yes please Brandon
02/03/24, 11:56 am - +263 77 633 8363: Okay sir
02/03/24, 12:00 pm - +263 77 533 6758: Morning how are you.
02/03/24, 12:03 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I am well Mr. Martini
02/03/24, 12:03 pm - Keshav Edoofa: So i would like to ask you a few questions, please!
02/03/24, 12:04 pm - +263 77 533 6758: Ok sir.
02/03/24, 12:05 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Mr. Martini you see as per my experience over the last couple of years, I have been fortunate to have assisted over hundreds of students in achieving their career aspiration through the Edoofa Program. 

One of my key observations during helping out these students was regarding what was the common trait amongst students who are today having the best of their time in India through the Edoofa Program, and honestly I was able to come down to only one aspect that is FAMILY SUPPORT
02/03/24, 12:05 pm - Keshav Edoofa: You see in this journey of any child's higher education, there are three major contributors 

1. Student himself/herself
2. FAMILY
3. EDOOFA PROGAM

Now all the students who are today successfully a part of the Edoofa Program, had all these three contributors working together towards the common goal which is student's success and ensuring that by the time student completes his/her higher education they should be able to get good paying jobs. 

Even if any one of the contributor does not perform to the best of their abilities, Student's overall success is hampered. Let me give you a few examples

*In the event if student wishes to work hard, Edoofa is willing to support but the Family is not willing to support, the student will not be successful under the program*

*In the event if student wishes to work hard, Family is willing to support, but Edoofa's academic Board doesn't find the student worthy, the student will not be successful under the program*

*In the event if Family is willing to support, Edoofa's Academic Board is willing to support but the student doesn't wishes to work hard, then also the student will not be successful under the program*
02/03/24, 12:05 pm - Keshav Edoofa: During the evaluation of your child's application so far, the Academic Board has evaluated a few aspects, such as student's willingness to work hard, and family's willingness to support the student so that the student can achieve what he/she has aspired. However now in your interview ahead, the Academic Board would be strictly be evaluating the Family's support towards the child higher education. 

*As you know in the event if your child is found eligible, you would have to complete a certain part of the formalities within the 7 day timeline, so may I know regarding the same, are you willing to support your child to the fullest?*
02/03/24, 12:15 pm - +263 77 533 6758: Yes l am willing to do my best to support my son to the fullest.
02/03/24, 12:16 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I am glad you as a parent are keeping track of your child's future opportunity that awaits for him to get him able to be successful ahead

Also, I really appreciate your efforts and support for your child's education, you are awesome, Kudos!
02/03/24, 12:16 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below
02/03/24, 12:16 pm - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>
02/03/24, 12:17 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I hope now you know Ideally, the tentative dates:

1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 8th or 9th of March 2024 for $200 and the 8th or 9th of April for the remaining $150.

2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 8th or 9th of March 2024

Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?
02/03/24, 12:27 pm - +263 77 533 6758: I loved to but financially not prepared.
02/03/24, 12:30 pm - Keshav Edoofa: May I know your concerns and challenges, please so I can help you out?
02/03/24, 12:47 pm - +263 77 533 6758: I am working as shop assistance and my total earning is usd$200 per month.lhave to pay Brandon's exam fee due  date 26 march 2024.there is also his two young brothers who  needs school fees.so everything is from the salary.

04/03/24, 3:26 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I understand what are you trying to share with me, but I would like to ask you then in such case how are you planning to proceed further with your child's education?
04/03/24, 4:30 pm - +263 77 533 6758: I was not yet ready to pay 350this year  because fees exploited me highly.l was hoping  that may be you would ask this fund 6 to 7month
04/03/24, 4:34 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Then in that case how would you make Brandon study even in Zimbabwe itself Mr. Martini?
04/03/24, 4:35 pm - Keshav Edoofa: If you compare this, with living and cost of education in Zimbabwe, 

1. UZ's fee for 2024 intake is $650-$750 a semester, meaning $1300-$1500 a year for tuition.
2. Cost of accommodation is around $80-$100 a month, meaning $1000-$1200 a year.
3. Cost of food, even if you consider a simple meal of sadza and chicken curry that costs $1, so $1 a meal and 3 meals a day that is $3 a day, which means almost $1200 a year.
4. Miscellaneous expenses such as travel, internet easily cost $40-$50 a month meaning $600 a year.

All in all cost of studying at locally in Zimbabwe is be around $4000-$4800 a year!
04/03/24, 5:23 pm - +263 77 633 8363: As you know sir in Africa most of pple including us are facing financial problems and we only hold on to faith that everything will be okay and for sure everything will flow. lm just saying that l know that my father is facing financial problems but lm with most certainity that he will work hard so that l have higher education. l will also try to find a piece job that can help with the funds so that l get higher education.
