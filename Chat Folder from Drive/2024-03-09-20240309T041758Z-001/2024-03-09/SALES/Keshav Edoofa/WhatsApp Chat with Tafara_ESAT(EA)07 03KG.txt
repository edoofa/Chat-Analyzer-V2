I am Keshav, Career counselor at Edoofa.

We have received your application under the prestigious ESAT Edoofa Scholastic Assessment Exam conducted in Harare from 17th February to 20th February 2024.

I hope I have contacted the right person!

I request you to add your Parents and Guardians so that we continue with the Counseling Session with you and your Family.
08/03/24, 10:23 am - +263 78 069 9562: Good morning, how are you. Before we proceed I would like to be clear of the situation first. If I were to get a 100% scholarship, do I still have to pay 1500 or so per year? Also do I get to know the value of the scholarship before enrollment into the program?
08/03/24, 11:57 am - Keshav Edoofa: I am well Tafara
08/03/24, 11:58 am - Keshav Edoofa: i would like you add your Parents and Guardians first in the group, please!
08/03/24, 12:06 pm - +263 78 069 9562: I am very sorry to say this but it seems my financial situation is not stable enough to get me into this program so I'll have to back out. I'm really sorry for wasting your time🙏🏽.
