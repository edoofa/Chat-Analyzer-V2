29/02/24, 2:06 pm - Keshav Edoofa: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
29/02/24, 2:06 pm - Keshav Edoofa: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
29/02/24, 2:06 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
29/02/24, 2:06 pm - Keshav Edoofa: It is with great pride that i would like to share with you that, recently we hosted a special conference for our Edoofians studying in India,  *SLICE - CON'24 - Symposium of Leaders, Innovators and Creators with Edoofa*, The students embarked on an enlightening industrial visit, immersing themselves in dynamic interactions with our esteemed Founders, CEOs, and visionary entrepreneurs. This is one of the many benefits of the Edoofa Scholarship Program and have a look at the glimpses of this auspicious 3 day event.

02/03/24, 1:15 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I feel you too are looking for something like this for Kenneth so that just like these students he can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards his higher education by himself and help you as parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
02/03/24, 1:19 pm - +263 77 277 7792: That's correct
02/03/24, 1:20 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Okay so @263780021499 @263772777792 , as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
06/03/24, 2:06 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
06/03/24, 2:06 pm - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>
06/03/24, 2:06 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
06/03/24, 3:10 pm - +263 77 277 7792: Noted
06/03/24, 3:10 pm - Keshav Edoofa: In simple words Mr. Brian what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well. 

However as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her counselling, eligibility check stage and is thorough throughout the evaluation, then they surely are rewarded with higher quantum of scholarship after which the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, now this , and even *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
06/03/24, 3:11 pm - +263 77 277 7792: Great
06/03/24, 3:12 pm - Keshav Edoofa: So now shall I brief you about the *Earn While You Learn Program*?
06/03/24, 3:14 pm - +263 77 277 7792: Yes please
06/03/24, 3:16 pm - Keshav Edoofa: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in
06/03/24, 3:16 pm - Keshav Edoofa: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

06/03/24, 3:16 pm - Keshav Edoofa: *3. Webinars: -*

06/03/24, 3:16 pm - Keshav Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase. 

*What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
06/03/24, 4:20 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I was expecting your response, but it seems you are occupied at the moment, so I will have to schedule your session for *tomorrow at 9:30 AM CAT* as my working hours are over for the day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning. 

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above-mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*

06/03/24, 5:02 pm - +263 77 277 7792: Enlightening and thought opening insights and am sure my son will benefit immensely and emerged as a high-powered executive in waiting to use his attained skills in his field of expertise.
07/03/24, 12:03 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Good morning @263772777792 @263780021499 
Shall we resume our discussion please
07/03/24, 12:14 pm - +263 77 277 7792: Yes please
07/03/24, 12:21 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I am glad Mr. Brian!
07/03/24, 12:22 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
07/03/24, 12:52 pm - +263 77 277 7792: Great.am sure Kenneth as a hard worker would earn e credits
07/03/24, 1:24 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I believe the same Mr. Brian
07/03/24, 1:25 pm - Keshav Edoofa: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

07/03/24, 1:25 pm - Keshav Edoofa: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
07/03/24, 1:28 pm - +263 77 277 7792: Indeed this is wat we have indeed been looking for and hoping for all along.and knowing Kenneth as e hard worker that he is ,I know he will be amongst e top workers
07/03/24, 1:29 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I am glad you are excited to see our program beneifts!
07/03/24, 1:29 pm - Keshav Edoofa: To summarize the EWYL program this means the more you work hard and do your projects and tasks in EWYL program the more you get paid for it in the form of scholarship credits and reduce your fee as much as you can!
07/03/24, 1:58 pm - +263 77 277 7792: Ok
07/03/24, 1:59 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Before we proceed ahead!
07/03/24, 1:59 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I need you to see the pictures and videos of the recent visit of the Edoofa team to Harare, Zimbabwe to interact with students and parents!

Alright Mr. Brian @263772777792 basically once we complete your counseling session I would give you time to properly discuss about your entire application once again with your family members so that they too could have much better clarity regarding the same. Meanwhile, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
07/03/24, 3:58 pm - +263 77 277 7792: Yes I am
07/03/24, 3:59 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Mr. Brian as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
07/03/24, 4:01 pm - +263 77 277 7792: Would say almost $2000
07/03/24, 4:01 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Exactly Mr. Brian, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
07/03/24, 4:02 pm - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>
07/03/24, 4:02 pm - Keshav Edoofa: *But, as we know the COVID-19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.* <This message was edited>
07/03/24, 4:02 pm - +263 77 277 7792: Great
07/03/24, 4:03 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university zapplications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
07/03/24, 4:04 pm - +263 77 277 7792: Indeed
07/03/24, 4:05 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
07/03/24, 4:05 pm - Keshav Edoofa: You see Edoofa's exceptional program has opened up a world of opportunities for aspiring students, garnering thousands of applications on a daily basis. The Eligibility Evaluation process ensures that deserving candidates are granted the chance to participate in the program. *Once accepted, students are requested to pay a nominal Program Fee of $350 within 7 days of receiving their acceptance letter*, following which they commence with their admission process and the esteemed Earn While You Learn Program. Edoofa's mission to provide quality education and support to students is at the heart of this initiative, and we are honored to make a difference in the lives of deserving individuals through this program.
07/03/24, 4:06 pm - Keshav Edoofa: However Mr. Brian, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
07/03/24, 4:34 pm - Keshav Edoofa: @263772777792 Mr. Brian I was expecting your response!
07/03/24, 5:02 pm - +263 77 277 7792: Noted.was completing work errands

08/03/24, 11:42 am - +263 77 277 7792: Yes I have read it and understood it
08/03/24, 11:45 am - Keshav Edoofa: From your response I can see you did understand the financial aspect of the Edoofa Program quite well, however I hope that you have understood how it totally depends upon the student to make his/her higher education affordable with the help of the Earn While You Learn Program's Scholarship Credits?
08/03/24, 12:08 pm - +263 77 277 7792: Yes I understand
08/03/24, 12:14 pm - Keshav Edoofa: That is great Mr. Brian
08/03/24, 12:15 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I am happy you could understand our program benefits!
08/03/24, 12:15 pm - Keshav Edoofa: As we are in the last phase of counseling session and it is about to end and only one aspect of the program is left to be explained
08/03/24, 12:15 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I would like you to see this video before that!
08/03/24, 12:15 pm - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>
