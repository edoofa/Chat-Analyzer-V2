22/02/24, 12:33 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Let me help you explain the Edoofa scholarship program!
22/02/24, 12:33 pm - Keshav Edoofa: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
22/02/24, 12:33 pm - Keshav Edoofa: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
22/02/24, 12:33 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
22/02/24, 12:33 pm - Keshav Edoofa: It is with great pride that i would like to share with you that, recently we hosted a special conference for our Edoofians studying in India,  *SLICE - CON'24 - Symposium of Leaders, Innovators and Creators with Edoofa*, The students embarked on an enlightening industrial visit, immersing themselves in dynamic interactions with our esteemed Founders, CEOs, and visionary entrepreneurs. This is one of the many benefits of the Edoofa Scholarship Program and have a look at the glimpses of this auspicious 3 day event.

22/02/24, 12:37 pm - +263 71 238 8684: Explain the pre test assessment of students
27/02/24, 1:20 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Good Afternoon @263782304800 @263712388684 
How are you, please?
27/02/24, 1:37 pm - +263 78 230 4800: I'm good how are you
27/02/24, 1:39 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I am doing good Kate
27/02/24, 1:40 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I hope you got some understanding about the Edoofa program?
27/02/24, 1:44 pm - +263 78 230 4800: Yes . I researched a little and I believe I have a better understanding now
27/02/24, 1:45 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
27/02/24, 1:46 pm - +263 78 230 4800: Yes indeed
27/02/24, 1:49 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Okay so Kate, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.
27/02/24, 1:57 pm - +263 78 230 4800: In the second part regarding the parents' participation are my chances of getting the scholarship low if one of my parents is not present in my life
27/02/24, 2:19 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Then who is the person in this group please?
Your guardian Kate?
27/02/24, 2:36 pm - +263 78 230 4800: That's my mom
I said one of my parents which is my dad who is not a part of my life
27/02/24, 3:08 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I am sorry to hear that Kate
27/02/24, 3:09 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Its alright Kate, your mother can interact during the session in that case
27/02/24, 8:48 pm - +263 78 230 4800: Okay
28/02/24, 8:20 am - Keshav Edoofa: Good Morning @263782304800 @263712388684

Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work) since I honestly don't know a lot about you?*
28/02/24, 12:23 pm - +263 78 230 4800: Okay so as you're already aware of I'm Kate Kondwelani Chirara aged 19 born on the fifth of January 2005. I did my high schooling at Langham Girls High School where I was the vice Headgirl of 2022 to 2023. I'm currently waiting waiting admission into a university which offers medicine because that's the field I would like to pursue. Descriptively , I would call myself as sophisticated , humble and bubbly person.In my spare time I like to listen to music or sometimes make some of my own and read novels from reputable writers. What I think are my strengths are optimism , self motivation and hard work. Like everyone I have weaknesses which are the fact that I'm too emotional and I overthink almost everything just to name a few. Family wise, I was raised by a single mother in a family of two girls. My mother who takes care of my sister and I works as a teacher in Harare. So that's me in a nutshell.
28/02/24, 1:29 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I really appreciate how sincere you were in expressing yourself, Kate. I have confidence that you are an exceptionally diligent student, and you will undoubtedly demonstrate your capabilities if given the right guidance!
28/02/24, 1:29 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Can you please elaborate a bit about your parents, please?
28/02/24, 4:23 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I was expecting your response, but it seems you are occupied at the moment, so I will have to schedule your session for *tomorrow at 9:30 AM CAT* as my working hours are over for the day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning. 

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above-mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
28/02/24, 4:39 pm - +263 78 230 4800: Well my parents are separated so my father did not take the responsibility of caring for he's children, my sister and I. So my whole life I've had only my mother to play the roles of both parents. I tried to reach out to him a couple of times but it was in vain.Hope I've answered your question.
28/02/24, 4:40 pm - +263 78 230 4800: Okay noted 
I was having a bit of a network challenge

29/02/24, 10:17 am - +263 78 230 4800: Well when I joined the scholarship program I was hoping it would be a chance to give her a break or cut some costs while getting quality education. <This message was edited>

29/02/24, 11:12 am - +263 78 230 4800: The field has a lot to learn about that I am very much interested in learning. Studying medicine will not only feed my curious eager mind but it'll we'll give me the opportunity to venture into the practice. I like to put an indelible inprint in people's lives by helping or assisting them. Becoming a medical doctor in my vision is another way to change the world , touch people's lives and put an impact in my society as well
29/02/24, 11:31 am - Keshav Edoofa: Kate, if you would have researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Medical course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*
29/02/24, 11:33 am - Keshav Edoofa: However Kate you can pursue courses that does not require physics to be mandatory
29/02/24, 11:36 am - Keshav Edoofa: These courses are BSc Cardiovascular Technology, B.Sc. Biology, B.Sc. Medical Laboratory Technology, Physiotherapy and B.Sc. Nursing
29/02/24, 11:46 am - +263 78 230 4800: I've done some research myself that why I was very much interested since India is very reputable in this area

29/02/24, 12:26 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Alright then i shall proceed ahead with the course explanation then!

In the following 5 years I'd have established my own surgery in Zimbabwe whilst scouting aspiring youngsters and assisting them as my way of giving back to the community
29/02/24, 5:17 pm - +263 78 230 4800: My apologies
The mobile network that I use has been having challenges this week
02/03/24, 12:31 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Good Afternoon @263782304800 @263712388684 
I hope you are doing well?
02/03/24, 1:20 pm - +263 78 230 4800: Im good. How are you
02/03/24, 1:20 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I am well Kate
02/03/24, 1:21 pm - Keshav Edoofa: That is really great Kate I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations,
Also I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
02/03/24, 1:32 pm - +263 78 230 4800: It was always my goal to study abroad not in just any country but India to be specific. Like you said India is very reputable in the field of study that I am interested in. Not only does it have the equipment for efficient study but it has flexible educational requirements. In Zimbabwe medicine and engineering are programs that you get if you're a straight A student. Although some who apply without required passes get the programs, chances are very slim .
02/03/24, 1:32 pm - +263 78 230 4800: I also feel like I need a totally new environment to put my focus entirely on my studies . Another reason I would like to study abroad is because it will give me a wider net of job opportunities.

As of now would you like to ask anything so far?

05/03/24, 10:52 am - +263 78 230 4800: Not yet. If I think of something I'll definitely contact you
05/03/24, 10:52 am - Keshav Edoofa: I am glad you could resonate and understand what I intended to share with you!
05/03/24, 10:53 am - +263 78 230 4800: Indeed I have
05/03/24, 10:55 am - +263 78 230 4800: Which criteria do you use to allocate universities to those who would have gotten in the program and if you can recommend universities in India that offer cardiovascular technology
05/03/24, 11:02 am - Keshav Edoofa: Once you get enrolled in the Edoofa family Kate, your application will be handed over to the admissions team
The admissions team will guide you and apply on your behalf to various universities and once you get an admission letter from one or more universities there will be mentioned the exact scholarship you will be receiving and you will be able to choose the university you wish to join!
05/03/24, 1:30 pm - +263 78 230 4800: Okay that's great news
05/03/24, 1:33 pm - Keshav Edoofa: So shall we proceed ahead?
05/03/24, 1:35 pm - +263 78 230 4800: Yes we may
05/03/24, 1:38 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
05/03/24, 1:38 pm - Keshav Edoofa: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
05/03/24, 1:38 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
05/03/24, 1:38 pm - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>
05/03/24, 1:38 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
05/03/24, 2:01 pm - +263 78 230 4800: Alright I'm following
05/03/24, 2:43 pm - Keshav Edoofa: In simple words Kate, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
05/03/24, 2:48 pm - +263 78 230 4800: Yees the earn as you learn program, will I be assisted in getting into this program
05/03/24, 2:48 pm - +263 78 230 4800: Are there any full scholarships offered by edoofa
05/03/24, 2:49 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Yes exactly Kate
05/03/24, 2:50 pm - Keshav Edoofa: We do happen to offer maximum scholarships @263782304800 but it depends upon various factors like grades, performance during the eligibility check stages, overall profile etc
05/03/24, 2:57 pm - +263 71 238 8684: Would it help if you may give me a guide on the grades that you normally desire for cardiovascular technologist just for me to see if my daughter has a chance of being enrolled with edoofa
05/03/24, 2:58 pm - +263 78 230 4800: Alright noted
05/03/24, 2:59 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Seeing the grades of Kate in O and A level she have a bright chance Mrs. @263712388684
05/03/24, 2:59 pm - Keshav Edoofa: So now shall I brief you about the EWYL program?
05/03/24, 3:00 pm - +263 71 238 8684: Okay 😊
05/03/24, 3:00 pm - +263 71 238 8684: Certainly
05/03/24, 3:00 pm - Keshav Edoofa: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in
05/03/24, 3:00 pm - Keshav Edoofa: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

*1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-_*Africa Global Radio*_ - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

-_*Skooqs*_ - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
05/03/24, 3:00 pm - Keshav Edoofa: *2. Recruitment Partners: -*

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
05/03/24, 3:00 pm - Keshav Edoofa: *3. Webinars: -*

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -

05/03/24, 3:00 pm - Keshav Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase. 

*What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
05/03/24, 4:50 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I was expecting your response, but it seems you are occupied at the moment, so I will have to schedule your session for *tomorrow at 9:30 AM CAT* as my working hours are over for the day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning. 

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above-mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
05/03/24, 4:52 pm - +263 78 230 4800: I'm halfway through the above messages
05/03/24, 5:07 pm - +263 78 230 4800: Yes I'm hoping it will benefit me as well. Sometimes situations don't turn out the way we expect and if the program can't help me to turn some unfortunate situations into job opportunities,,I'm more than earger to be part of the edoofan family
05/03/24, 5:08 pm - +263 78 230 4800: This message was deleted
05/03/24, 5:09 pm - +263 78 230 4800: Are there any serminars scheduled for this year
06/03/24, 9:27 am - Keshav Edoofa: Good Morning @263782304800 @263712388684 
How are you, please?
06/03/24, 9:28 am - +263 78 230 4800: I'm good
how are you?
06/03/24, 9:39 am - Keshav Edoofa: I am well Kate, thank you for your concern!
06/03/24, 9:40 am - Keshav Edoofa: I hope Mrs. @263712388684 is in good health!
06/03/24, 9:47 am - +263 71 238 8684: Morning thank you am well
06/03/24, 9:49 am - Keshav Edoofa: That is great to know
06/03/24, 1:35 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I am expecting your response @263782304800
06/03/24, 1:46 pm - +263 78 230 4800: I'm here 
I was waiting for you to proceed
06/03/24, 1:51 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Yes sure Kate many events and seminars are scheduled for this year as well!
06/03/24, 1:52 pm - Keshav Edoofa: That is great Kate!
06/03/24, 1:53 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
06/03/24, 2:01 pm - +263 78 230 4800: Okay I'm following
Can you give an example of the kind of jobs one can do in the pay as you learn program
06/03/24, 2:04 pm - Keshav Edoofa: The kind of projects and tasks you will be doing will be linked to the real-life skills required for jobs today that is the actual motive of the EWYL program like Networking, digital marketing, communication, social media, and many more!
06/03/24, 2:05 pm - +263 78 230 4800: Understood
You may proceed
06/03/24, 2:06 pm - Keshav Edoofa: To summarize this EWYL program, it means the more you work hard and do your projects and tasks in EWYL program the more you get paid for it in the form of scholarship credits and reduce your fee as much as you can!
06/03/24, 2:17 pm - +263 78 230 4800: This is quite flexible. Sounds like a good program
06/03/24, 2:19 pm - Keshav Edoofa: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

06/03/24, 2:19 pm - Keshav Edoofa: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
06/03/24, 2:22 pm - +263 78 230 4800: Indeed I have and it's exactly what I was looking for and more
06/03/24, 2:23 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I am glad you could understand what I intended to share with you so that I can help you and guide you to secure maximum scholarship for your education and you do wonders ahead!
06/03/24, 2:25 pm - +263 78 230 4800: So am I and thank you for the assistance
06/03/24, 2:26 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Before we proceed ahead!
06/03/24, 2:26 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I need you to see the pictures and videos of the recent visit of the Edoofa team to Harare, Zimbabwe to interact with students and parents!

06/03/24, 3:00 pm - +263 78 230 4800: So there will be similar visits some time this year
06/03/24, 3:01 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Yes Kate many seminars and events are lined for the Proud Edoofians!
06/03/24, 3:02 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Alright so now @263782304800 , basically once we complete your counseling session I would give you time to properly discuss about your entire application once again with your family members so that they too could have much better clarity regarding the same. Meanwhile, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
06/03/24, 3:04 pm - +263 78 230 4800: Yes I am
06/03/24, 3:05 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Kate as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
06/03/24, 3:07 pm - +263 78 230 4800: Something in the range of $1500 -$2250 <This message was edited>
06/03/24, 3:08 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Exactly,and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
06/03/24, 3:08 pm - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>
06/03/24, 3:08 pm - Keshav Edoofa: *But, as we know the COVID-19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
06/03/24, 3:10 pm - +263 78 230 4800: Does this fee guarantee enrollment into a university
06/03/24, 3:10 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university zapplications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
06/03/24, 3:12 pm - +263 78 230 4800: Provided there is guaranteed admission into a university, yes it is
06/03/24, 3:13 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I am glad to hear that
06/03/24, 3:14 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
06/03/24, 3:14 pm - Keshav Edoofa: You see Edoofa's exceptional program has opened up a world of opportunities for aspiring students, garnering thousands of applications on a daily basis. The Eligibility Evaluation process ensures that deserving candidates are granted the chance to participate in the program. *Once accepted, students are requested to pay a nominal Program Fee of $350 within 7 days of receiving their acceptance letter*, following which they commence with their admission process and the esteemed Earn While You Learn Program. Edoofa's mission to provide quality education and support to students is at the heart of this initiative, and we are honored to make a difference in the lives of deserving individuals through this program.
06/03/24, 3:14 pm - Keshav Edoofa: However Kate and @263712388684 as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
06/03/24, 3:16 pm - +263 78 230 4800: What happens if the student fails to pay the amount within the stipulated time
06/03/24, 3:17 pm - +263 78 230 4800: Okay I've been answered
06/03/24, 3:17 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Yes please!
06/03/24, 3:18 pm - Keshav Edoofa: From your response I can see you did understand the financial aspect of the Edoofa Program quite well, however I hope that you have understood how it totally depends upon the student to make his/her higher education affordable with the help of the Earn While You Learn Program's Scholarship Credits?
06/03/24, 3:20 pm - +263 78 230 4800: I have indeed understood and like you said you'll give us time ,my family and I to discuss and we will do just that
06/03/24, 3:22 pm - +263 71 238 8684: So where and how are these payments made
06/03/24, 3:23 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Yes Sure Kate however
06/03/24, 3:23 pm - Keshav Edoofa: As we are in the last phase of counseling session and it is about to end and only one aspect of the program is left to be explained
06/03/24, 3:23 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I would like you to see this video before that!
06/03/24, 3:23 pm - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>
06/03/24, 3:24 pm - +263 78 230 4800: Okay I'm on it
06/03/24, 3:41 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Did you watch the video Kate?
06/03/24, 3:49 pm - +263 71 238 8684: I watched the video Kate has run out of data and here network is having challenges
