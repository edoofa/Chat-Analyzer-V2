08/03/24, 11:24 am - Keshav Edoofa: I shall brief you about the Edoofa scholarship program to you all!
08/03/24, 11:24 am - Keshav Edoofa: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
08/03/24, 11:24 am - Keshav Edoofa: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
08/03/24, 11:24 am - Keshav Edoofa: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.

08/03/24, 11:24 am - Keshav Edoofa: It is with great pride that i would like to share with you that, recently we hosted a special conference for our Edoofians studying in India,  *SLICE - CON'24 - Symposium of Leaders, Innovators and Creators with Edoofa*, The students embarked on an enlightening industrial visit, immersing themselves in dynamic interactions with our esteemed Founders, CEOs, and visionary entrepreneurs. This is one of the many benefits of the Edoofa Scholarship Program and have a look at the glimpses of this auspicious 3 day event.
08/03/24, 11:29 am - +263 78 293 0149: Okay i have gone through the summary. We can proceed
08/03/24, 11:32 am - Keshav Edoofa: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
08/03/24, 11:34 am - +263 78 293 0149: Yes it sure is right
08/03/24, 11:36 am - Keshav Edoofa: That is great!
08/03/24, 11:36 am - Keshav Edoofa: I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.
08/03/24, 11:40 am - +263 78 293 0149: Okay 

The other number you added into the group ot is my father's contact
08/03/24, 11:41 am - +263 78 293 0149: Also i would like to ask if the counselling would require doing any calls just incase i stay near a wifi with a stronger connection
08/03/24, 11:46 am - Keshav Edoofa: You just need a strong network and the session will be through text messages, please
08/03/24, 11:47 am - Keshav Edoofa: I want you as well Mr. Stewart to acknowledge this message!
08/03/24, 11:47 am - Keshav Edoofa: @263717174025
08/03/24, 11:47 am - +263 78 293 0149: Okay sure
08/03/24, 11:47 am - Keshav Edoofa: Alright so @263782930149 , now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.

I would like to know you better as a student, so please go ahead, and tell me a bit about yourself, your education, what you wish to study, your strengths, your weaknesses, your hobbies, and a detailed description of your family background, *Where do your parents work (Place) in your country or any other country that they have relocated to due to work promises?  Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work) since I honestly don't know a lot about you?*
08/03/24, 11:48 am - +263 78 293 0149: Currently he seems to be ofdline and i am not around him at the moment...let me try and get in touch with him
08/03/24, 11:48 am - Keshav Edoofa: Its Alright Kunashe, he may respond whenever he is available, Just tell him to keep a follow up on your session!

08/03/24, 11:49 am - Keshav Edoofa: Let us resume with your response to this!
08/03/24, 12:03 pm - +263 78 293 0149: I Kunashe Buzuzi as a student who recently completed his A level education at Marondera high school i find myself to be a young man who is greatly motivated by find challenges and finding solutions to them ,also it really makes me feel great creating somethings of my own which would not only benefit me but also my family and community. I have more interest in the business field and i would love to do the bachelors degree in Business Adminstration.

Some of my strengths is that i am a good and patient communicater who is also good in working with a team. I have figured out that working with others towards a goal is also one of my greatest motivators. Then when it comes to weaknesses i wouldnt really say it is a weakness for me but i hate to be surrounded by people with negative minds or negative energy which would be a source of demotivation for the others .
My hobbies are rugby and basketball. Also i really enjoy socialising with peers ,i find it to be one of the things i enjoy the most.
I come from a middle earning family and cureently my one parent that i have is currently not employed due to a few challenges but his former occupation he worked as a transporter.

I think this is all the information i have.Fell free to ask if there is anything else you would need to know
08/03/24, 1:34 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I really appreciate how sincere you were in expressing yourself, Kunashe. I have confidence that you are an exceptionally diligent student, and you will undoubtedly demonstrate your capabilities if given the right guidance!
08/03/24, 1:34 pm - Keshav Edoofa: May I know who has supported your secondary education till now and who is going to support you financially with your higher education abroad?
08/03/24, 2:28 pm - +263 78 293 0149: Yes i sure will demonstrate with the best effort
