*I am Mr. Keshav, Career Counselor at Edoofa and we also have with us Mr Piyush, the Head of Counseling.* 

We have received an application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program from your friend and our student Sizalobuhle 

I hope I have contacted the right person?

As we were flooded with applications today and we didn't want to rush your application, so I have managed to reserve a time slot *tomorrow morning at 9:30 AM CAT*, I would appreciate if you stay active and connected at the given time for a 2-hour counseling session so that we can process your application

In the meantime, I am leaving you with a video do go through it properly <This message was edited>

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above-mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
