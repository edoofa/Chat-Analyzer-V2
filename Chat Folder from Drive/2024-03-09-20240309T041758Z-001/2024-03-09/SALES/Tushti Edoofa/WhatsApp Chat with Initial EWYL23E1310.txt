28/2/24, 1:33 PM - Tushti Edoofa: I am absolutely good. Thanks for asking.
28/2/24, 1:33 PM - Tushti Edoofa: Now, before we proceed further, I'd love to get to know you better! Would you be willing to share a bit about yourself? Your hobbies, goals, and passions?

28/2/24, 1:39 PM - +263 78 555 7328: Ok in brief l am from a family of five including myself. As for my hobbies l spend my time playing chess , handball , basketball  and l also enjoy videogames. My goals are to acquire employment nationally and even internationally after completing my tertiary education and l am  passionate in spending my time in the fields and that being the reason l took Bachelor of science in Agriculture for my tertiary education.
28/2/24, 1:42 PM - Tushti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing a bit about yourself. It's great to hear about your diverse interests, from sports like chess, handball, and basketball to your passion for video games. Your educational pursuit in Bachelor of Science in Agriculture aligns well with your goal of making an impact in the fields.
28/2/24, 1:42 PM - Tushti Edoofa: So, to kick things off with a bang, I wanted to share a video with you that I think will help us connect on a deeper level. Get ready to be inspired!
28/2/24, 1:43 PM - Tushti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
28/2/24, 1:43 PM - +263 78 555 7328: Ok
28/2/24, 1:53 PM - +263 78 555 7328: Duly noted
28/2/24, 1:54 PM - Tushti Edoofa: Great to hear.
28/2/24, 1:55 PM - Tushti Edoofa: Well, I can see that someone else has joined the group besides you. May I learn a little about them? I would appreciate it if we could engage in a quick conversation and get to know each other a bit.
28/2/24, 1:56 PM - +263 78 555 7328: It's my mother she currently is at work but she works as a retail shop owner
28/2/24, 1:59 PM - Tushti Edoofa: I extend a warm welcome to you for the exciting and incredible EWYL journey and I can assure you that Initial will learn a lot from this journey to success.
I can see that  Initial is very lucky to have such supportive mother like you.
28/2/24, 2:00 PM - +263 78 555 7328: She's currently at work now
28/2/24, 2:01 PM - Tushti Edoofa: Okay that is fine!
28/2/24, 2:01 PM - Tushti Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
28/2/24, 2:02 PM - +263 78 555 7328: EWYL program as well as Education am l right
28/2/24, 2:04 PM - Tushti Edoofa: It seems there might be a bit of addition too in your message.
28/2/24, 2:04 PM - Tushti Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
28/2/24, 2:04 PM - +263 78 555 7328: Ok
28/2/24, 2:04 PM - Tushti Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
28/2/24, 2:06 PM - +263 78 555 7328: Noted
28/2/24, 2:06 PM - +263 78 555 7328: Ok
28/2/24, 2:07 PM - Tushti Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skillset through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
28/2/24, 2:08 PM - +263 78 555 7328: That's great to know thank you very much
28/2/24, 2:28 PM - Tushti Edoofa: Great to hear from you.
28/2/24, 2:28 PM - Tushti Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
28/2/24, 2:41 PM - +263 78 555 7328: Yes
28/2/24, 2:42 PM - Tushti Edoofa: Great to hear from you.
28/2/24, 2:42 PM - Tushti Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 10 minutes should be enough.

29/2/24, 1:48 PM - Tushti Edoofa: So may I know which section from the newsletter you *liked the most*, personally for me, it is very difficult to tell, each section has its taste and interest.
29/2/24, 1:55 PM - +263 78 555 7328: Mostly l went through the inspirational quotes and they really touched my heart as well as the pictures which give me hope that others from Africa are waiting for me there

3. There is an additional opportunity to earn $5 worth of Scholarship credits by connecting with students to provide clarity to them about the Edoofa Scholarship, which the Edoofa team will share with you!
4/3/24, 2:25 PM - Tushti Edoofa: Initial do you have any doubt?
4/3/24, 2:32 PM - +263 78 555 7328: Ok
4/3/24, 2:32 PM - +263 78 555 7328: Received
4/3/24, 2:33 PM - +263 78 555 7328: Not at all
4/3/24, 2:33 PM - Tushti Edoofa: Well that is awesome.
4/3/24, 2:33 PM - Tushti Edoofa: I will share with you interesting tips stay connected with me.
4/3/24, 2:34 PM - Tushti Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
4/3/24, 2:37 PM - Tushti Edoofa: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*
4/3/24, 2:37 PM - Tushti Edoofa: *STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME*
For eg: In your case, it will be-
*INITIAL/JULIA*
4/3/24, 2:37 PM - Tushti Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
4/3/24, 2:38 PM - Tushti Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)

Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
4/3/24, 2:38 PM - Tushti Edoofa: Make sure that before you start interacting with the participants in the group that you created for the community-building project, YOU ADD ME.

The purpose of doing this is that:
- I will be able to track your progress and guide you through learning the networking skill
- I will be able to see the concerns raised by students and we can discuss them accordingly.
- I will be able to see whether the right information has been shared with all the students

4/3/24, 2:39 PM - Tushti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
4/3/24, 2:39 PM - Tushti Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
4/3/24, 2:46 PM - Tushti Edoofa: I am ____________, a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in Zimbabwe, where tuition fees range from ZWL 650,000 to ZWL 750,000 per term. When considering the yearly cost, including food and accommodation, it exceeds $2,100 in our beloved Zimbabwe.

Today, the internet is a necessity, and I truly realized its importance when preparing for my journey to India. We are all well aware of the expenses we have to bear just to access subpar internet services. During my school days, I used to spend a minimum of $35-$40 a month to ensure I had sufficient internet, which added up to around $450-$500 annually. It's remarkable to discover that in India, students value their educational infrastructure so much that they can access a necessity like the internet for around $40 for the entire year.

Conversely, when speaking to my seniors in Zimbabwe, I realized that I might have to compromise on my choice of course due to limited available seats. Furthermore, many seniors are struggling with unemployment after graduating in Zimbabwe.

I had a strong desire to support my family through part-time employment during my course, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn between $50 and $100 per month throughout the course.

While pursuing tertiary education in India is more affordable than universities in Zimbabwe, it comes with its own challenges. I diligently followed the 5'S, which played a crucial role in helping me qualify for this scholarship. I urge you to go through these Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors will ask you questions based on the information in the flyer I have attached

Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

So in such a case, we insist that the Principal and you to form a WhatsApp group where they can add me and other students of your school.
