8/3/24, 9:07 AM - Tushti Edoofa: But that is okay. You can try on another time.
8/3/24, 9:08 AM - Tushti Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
8/3/24, 9:10 AM - +263 77 955 4907: No Ma'am l don't understand. What are the two objectives
8/3/24, 9:10 AM - Tushti Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
8/3/24, 9:11 AM - Tushti Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
8/3/24, 9:12 AM - +263 77 955 4907: Okay Ma'am now l understand
8/3/24, 9:13 AM - Tushti Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skillset through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
8/3/24, 9:15 AM - +263 77 955 4907: Okay, thank you for the introductions Ma'am
8/3/24, 9:16 AM - Tushti Edoofa: It is my pleasure and our EWYL team is really honored to have such a young mind like you!
8/3/24, 9:16 AM - +263 77 955 4907: Thank you
8/3/24, 9:18 AM - Tushti Edoofa: You are welcome!
8/3/24, 9:18 AM - Tushti Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
8/3/24, 9:20 AM - +263 77 955 4907: Yes, this sounds interesting. I am ready to learn Ma'am
8/3/24, 9:22 AM - Tushti Edoofa: Good to hear from you!
8/3/24, 9:22 AM - Tushti Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 10 minutes should be enough.
8/3/24, 9:22 AM - Tushti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
8/3/24, 9:22 AM - Tushti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
8/3/24, 9:23 AM - +263 77 955 4907: Okay Ma'am let me read them
8/3/24, 9:24 AM - Tushti Edoofa: Sure! Let me know after you complete!
8/3/24, 9:35 AM - +263 77 955 4907: I have read the two newsletters. They are full of wisdom. I was motivated by the stories and quotes shared in the newsletters.
8/3/24, 9:38 AM - Tushti Edoofa: Did you notice the _Edoofa Hall of Inspiration_? I am sure you would one day want yourself to be celebrated in this section, the entire Student community reads this newsletter and it's a great deal to be mentioned by the founder himself, isn't it?
8/3/24, 9:43 AM - +263 77 955 4907: Yes Ma'am l did. I also want  to be celebrated in that section one day. I would also want to be mentioned by the Founder one day. It will mean a lot to me
8/3/24, 9:48 AM - Tushti Edoofa: I am happy to hear that you are imagining yourself to be celebrated in the hall of inspiration. Together we will work hard to reach your goals of becoming a founder.
8/3/24, 9:49 AM - +263 77 955 4907: Thank you
8/3/24, 9:52 AM - Tushti Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
