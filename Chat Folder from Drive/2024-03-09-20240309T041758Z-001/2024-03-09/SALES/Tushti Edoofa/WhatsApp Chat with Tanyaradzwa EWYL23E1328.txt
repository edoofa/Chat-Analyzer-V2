8/3/24, 9:09 AM - +263 71 711 4926: on it
8/3/24, 9:10 AM - Tushti Edoofa: Perfect!
8/3/24, 9:10 AM - Tushti Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
8/3/24, 9:11 AM - +263 71 711 4926: l think l do understand
8/3/24, 9:12 AM - Tushti Edoofa: Okay! But let me explain in a more effective way.
8/3/24, 9:12 AM - Tushti Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
8/3/24, 9:13 AM - Tushti Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
8/3/24, 9:14 AM - +263 71 711 4926: noted
8/3/24, 9:14 AM - +263 71 711 4926: understood
8/3/24, 9:15 AM - Tushti Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skillset through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
8/3/24, 9:16 AM - +263 71 711 4926: okay good to know
8/3/24, 9:17 AM - Tushti Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
8/3/24, 9:19 AM - +263 71 711 4926: yes it sounds grt
8/3/24, 9:20 AM - Tushti Edoofa: Good to hear from you!
8/3/24, 9:20 AM - Tushti Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 10 minutes should be enough.
8/3/24, 9:21 AM - Tushti Edoofa: <Media omitted>

8/3/24, 9:44 AM - Tushti Edoofa: Happy to hear that Tanyaradzwa! So may I know which section from the newsletter you *liked the most*, personally for me, it is very difficult to tell, each section has its taste and interest.
8/3/24, 9:47 AM - +263 71 711 4926: yeah l will have to agree with you on that one .it is very very difficult
8/3/24, 9:47 AM - +263 71 711 4926: l liked all of it
8/3/24, 9:50 AM - Tushti Edoofa: Did you notice the _Edoofa Hall of Inspiration_? I am sure you would one day want yourself to be celebrated in this section, the entire Student community reads this newsletter and it's a great deal to be mentioned by the founder himself, isn't it?
8/3/24, 9:53 AM - +263 71 711 4926: yeah its kinda of a big deal hope will be mentioned too in future
8/3/24, 9:54 AM - Tushti Edoofa: Yes you can also make it. Have a strong faith in yourself.
8/3/24, 9:54 AM - Tushti Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
8/3/24, 9:54 AM - Tushti Edoofa: 1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
