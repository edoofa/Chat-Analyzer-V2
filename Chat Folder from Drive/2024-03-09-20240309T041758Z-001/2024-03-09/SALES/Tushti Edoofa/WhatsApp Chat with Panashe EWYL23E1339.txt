8/3/24, 2:39 PM - Tushti Edoofa: That's impressive! Balancing subjects like mathematics, business studies, and geography in upper six shows dedication and a diverse skill set. It's great that you have a passion for table tennis and volleyball to unwind during your spare time.

Aspiring to become an actuary is a fantastic goal, and the ambition to have your own insurance company is both bold and admirable. The world of finance and insurance can be challenging but incredibly rewarding. Keep pursuing your dreams
8/3/24, 2:41 PM - Tushti Edoofa: So, to kick things off with a bang, I wanted to share a video with you that I think will help us connect on a deeper level. Get ready to be inspired!

8/3/24, 3:08 PM - +263 71 704 5451: ok
8/3/24, 3:10 PM - Tushti Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
8/3/24, 3:11 PM - +263 71 704 5451: im not sure
8/3/24, 3:11 PM - Tushti Edoofa: I will help you.
8/3/24, 3:11 PM - +263 71 704 5451: ok
8/3/24, 3:11 PM - Tushti Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
8/3/24, 3:12 PM - Tushti Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
8/3/24, 3:13 PM - +263 71 704 5451: ok
8/3/24, 3:15 PM - Tushti Edoofa: Alright, Panashe. As our session comes to an end, remember: "The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams." - Eleanor Roosevelt

Keep dreaming big, stay focused, and make every moment count.
8/3/24, 3:26 PM - +263 71 704 5451: ok thanks
8/3/24, 3:31 PM - Tushti Edoofa: Thank you and have a nice day!
