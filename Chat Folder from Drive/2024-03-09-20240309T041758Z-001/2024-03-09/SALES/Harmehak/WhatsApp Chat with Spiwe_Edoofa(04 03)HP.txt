05/03/24, 2:23 pm - Harmehak: Spiwe, I understand that you were a part of the grand event and presentation by the esteemed Founders of the Edoofa Program Mr. Angad Singh and Mr. Avreen Singh. 

*Your results for the ESAT 2024 is 49/100*

Congratulations for Sailing Through!
05/03/24, 2:25 pm - +263 78 987 7253: Olky thanks noted
05/03/24, 2:26 pm - +263 78 987 7253: Olky olk... good to meet you 🤝
05/03/24, 2:26 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate!

So Spiwe, we understand you have gone through the Brochures and Flyers of the Edoofa Program.
To emphasize  *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and has been rewarding meritorious students to lower their Fee Structure less than what you will end up paying at the Local Zimbabwe University
05/03/24, 2:32 pm - +263 78 987 7253: Olk...olk...
05/03/24, 2:33 pm - Harmehak: Okay so Spiwe, as we start discussing your results further, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 


Qualification to the ESAT Exam (Please note EDOOFA calculates your results based on the TOP performers' Score so it is the percentile that we will be evaluating on)
A Level and Previous Results 
*Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 
*Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these Four  significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
05/03/24, 2:40 pm - +263 78 987 7253: Yaeeh l think so .but my  Guardians are at work fr now

I also have access to the Feedback form that you filled out after the session with your parents and I hope you are aware, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
06/03/24, 1:01 pm - +263 78 987 7253: Noted
06/03/24, 1:03 pm - Harmehak: In simple words Spiwe, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
06/03/24, 1:16 pm - Harmehak: What is your take on the same, Spiwe?
06/03/24, 1:36 pm - +263 78 987 7253: Ooooh..ok okay

06/03/24, 1:46 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate, Spiwe!

06/03/24, 1:57 pm - +263 78 987 7253: Yaeeh but l was  late fr the exam  l didn't attend an of the of presentations..that day
06/03/24, 2:15 pm - Harmehak: Oh alright please!
06/03/24, 2:15 pm - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
06/03/24, 2:16 pm - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
06/03/24, 2:19 pm - +263 78 987 7253: Interesting
06/03/24, 2:19 pm - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

06/03/24, 2:26 pm - +263 78 987 7253: Olky olk now l understand..
Thank you
06/03/24, 2:30 pm - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
06/03/24, 2:43 pm - Harmehak: I hope by now you have a better clarity, Spiwe?
06/03/24, 2:46 pm - +263 78 987 7253: Yes
06/03/24, 2:51 pm - Harmehak: Alright Spiwe, I hope you remember Dr. Gupta discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your parents were informed the same, so will they be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education? <This message was edited>
06/03/24, 2:56 pm - +263 78 987 7253: Yaeeh they are
06/03/24, 2:57 pm - Harmehak: Great, I hope you also remember Dr. Gupta also shared about the Enrollment Fee of USD 350 that EDOOFA charges upfront, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
06/03/24, 3:01 pm - +263 78 987 7253: Yaeeh
06/03/24, 3:03 pm - Harmehak: So for an Edoofian the Enrollment Fee would include:

*1. Guaranteed Scholarship*
*2. Application fee of all the Edoofa’s Associated Universities*
*3. Cost of Multiple Statement of Purposes drafted*
*4. Recommendation Letter drafted for the Student*
*5. Earn While You Learn Program’s Training*
*6. Visa Assistance*
*7. SLICE CON*
*8. Department of Student Welfare*
*9. Attachments and Internship Opportunities*
06/03/24, 3:42 pm - Harmehak: Do ensure active participation, Spiwe!
06/03/24, 4:53 pm - +263 78 987 7253: Ohh ok.. sorry
06/03/24, 4:59 pm - Harmehak: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
06/03/24, 4:59 pm - Harmehak: You see Edoofa's exceptional program has opened up a world of opportunities for aspiring students, garnering thousands of applications on a daily basis. The Eligibility Evaluation process ensures that deserving candidates are granted the chance to participate in the program. *Once accepted, students are requested to pay a nominal Program Fee of $350 within 7 days of receiving their acceptance letter*, following which they commence with their admission process and the esteemed Earn While You Learn Program. Edoofa's mission to provide quality education and support to students is at the heart of this initiative, and we are honored to make a difference in the lives of deserving individuals through this program.
06/03/24, 4:59 pm - Harmehak: Considering your results of ESAT we also offer an additional waiver of *USD 50* in your Enrollment Fee upon your consideration in the Slice Con 24 Committee Fund.


Out of a Total of 3000 students only 200 have been given this opportunity, as a counselor I feel it's a great privilege that has been offered to you.
06/03/24, 5:05 pm - +263 78 987 7253: Oh l understand really appreciate
06/03/24, 5:06 pm - Harmehak: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $100 within the next 30 days.*
06/03/24, 5:09 pm - +263 78 987 7253: Ooh that would be much better Ms
06/03/24, 5:10 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate!
06/03/24, 5:11 pm - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
06/03/24, 5:11 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
06/03/24, 5:11 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in their country itself.
06/03/24, 5:11 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
06/03/24, 5:18 pm - +263 78 987 7253: Yes I understood Ms
06/03/24, 5:18 pm - Harmehak: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
06/03/24, 5:18 pm - Harmehak: Basically, this registration fee ($500-$1000) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024-2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
06/03/24, 5:18 pm - Harmehak: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*

Here is a picture of the Visa of one of the Edoofian who arrived in India, for 2023 Academic Intake.

06/03/24, 5:26 pm - +263 78 987 7253: My phone is about to shutdown Ms Harmehak..there is no electricity
Can we continue tomorrow the conversation
06/03/24, 5:57 pm - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
06/03/24, 5:57 pm - Harmehak: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)

06/03/24, 8:06 pm - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
06/03/24, 8:06 pm - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
06/03/24, 8:06 pm - Harmehak: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

Your scholarship journey is reaching a crucial juncture. *Tomorrow on “07-03-24” at 11:30 A.M. CAT,* I will meticulously evaluate your application. This session is not just about answering your questions; it includes a vital Eligibility Check Interview.

We strongly recommend parents/guardians join, recognizing that higher education is a family decision. Prepare for a series of interviews, marking a significant phase in finalizing your scholarship application. As your counselor, I wish you the very best. It's been a pleasure guiding you through your career sessions.

If you qualify for the interview, we would proceed ahead and we look forward to welcoming you to India. Please be proactive, as everyone's time is valuable. The Senior Counselor and Director will make decisions based on your interview and adhere strictly to the given time. Follow instructions diligently, and if the session is completed within the allotted time, your application will proceed.

Happy Family Discussion!
Stay Blessed!
