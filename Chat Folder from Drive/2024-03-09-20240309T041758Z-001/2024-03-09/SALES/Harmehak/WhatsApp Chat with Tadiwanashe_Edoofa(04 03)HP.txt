08/03/24, 9:29 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
08/03/24, 9:59 am - +27 65 271 9279: Good morning,, do you have any offices in Zimbabwe
08/03/24, 10:09 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
08/03/24, 10:09 am - Harmehak: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program. 
We are associated with more than 200 schools in Zimbabwe. Some of the most elite Schools in Zimbabawe example in Harare we are collaborated with St. Dominic’s Chishawasha, Dominican Convent, Christ Ministries and many others. In Manicaland we have a total of 18 Schools to name a few St. David’s Girls Bonda, Hartzell High, First Class, First Choice and so on.  Chipinge we have Chibuwe High School, you would be happy to know that the DEO’s of Mutare and Chipinge have their kids under the Edoofa Scholarship. Masvingo we have 24 Schools collaborated with over 300 students from some of the best schools example Pamushana, St. Antony’s, Reformed Church Gutu, Zaka High and many others. The program is also appreciated by the Education Inspector of Bikita Madam Makomeke.We have more than 500 students from Mashonaland (West, Central and East) Province, Midlands Province.  Last but not the Least we also have Schools from Bulawayo and Matebaland South associated with Edoofa. 

Our collaborations with the UCE College Bulawayo adds a feather to the Cap of trust that Edoofa has built in a span of 14 years. 

The Schools, Institutions and Educationists who have made efforts to train the students for this prestigious Scholarship Program are also the Authorized Designatories of EDOOFA in Zimbabawe. 
We have Mr. Shorwi Kawadza (Retd. Headmaster Hartzell), Mr. Charles Jerera (Retd. Ministry of Education), Ms. Christina Rockson (Founder and Principal of Hilltop Christian College in SA) who have shown relentless efforts to guide students on the right path to success.EDOOFA boasts a proud students and parents community of more than 2000 from Zimbabwe who are happy with the quality of education and the employability outcomes.
08/03/24, 10:17 am - +27 65 271 9279: What are your requirements for someone to get the scholarship? Is it 100 percent funded?
08/03/24, 10:17 am - Harmehak: You see, *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4000 students from different African countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
08/03/24, 10:25 am - +27 65 271 9279: How long does it take, for you to respond, after applying for the scholarship?
08/03/24, 10:27 am - Harmehak: Mrs Patricia, we are currently in the discussion for the same itself.

Right now after receiving the application, we begin with the counseling session, whereby I will brief you about all the details following a thorough process.
08/03/24, 10:27 am - Harmehak: Did Tadiwanashe happen to brief you about her application through her friend Munyaradzi, who is a part of the program?
08/03/24, 10:28 am - +27 65 271 9279: She did
08/03/24, 10:28 am - +27 65 271 9279: Okay
08/03/24, 10:30 am - Harmehak: Great!
08/03/24, 10:30 am - Harmehak: So far, have you been able to follow the shared information?

If so, now may I know your understanding of a 100% funded scholarship?
08/03/24, 10:32 am - +27 65 271 9279: It's an all funded scholarship.. All expenses paid.. From tuition, stationery, accommodation and flights
08/03/24, 10:39 am - Harmehak: Actually you are mistaken over here, let me explain to you that there are two kinds of programs that provide assistance to the students because a lot of times parents and students themselves misunderstand what a Scholarship actually means.

*1. Scholarships*
*2. Sponsorships*

Scholarships make education *affordable* for the students by reducing their *Tuition Fees*, now a lot of times parents and students consider that a Domestic Scholarship would be the same as an International Scholarship, but to understand the difference between them, consider yourself applying for an education in your own country with the help of a scholarship. Now after the scholarship when your tuition fee would be reduced, eventually your entire cost of education would be reduced because being a citizen of the country, you wouldn't be required to spend any fees on Accommodation and feeding separately since in that case, students would be staying with their families. However, if I personally plan to study in Zimbabwe with the same scholarship, I would have to incur some costs on Accommodation and Feeding because I am not a Zimbabwean Citizen. So a lot of times parents and students consider International Scholarship and Domestic Scholarship one and the same thing, but in reality, they aren't.

Sponsorships, on the other hand, take care entirely of a student's education, but because Sponsorships are provided by only a few organizations, there are a lot of terms and conditions which a student might need to follow in order to get the sponsorship, the most common term is that a student after completion of the course would have to work for the organization providing the sponsorship for a period of time.
08/03/24, 10:44 am - +27 65 271 9279: Okay,, thanks for the clarifying
08/03/24, 10:53 am - Harmehak: You're very welcome
08/03/24, 10:53 am - Harmehak: *Alright so Tadiwanashe, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.*

I would like to know you better as a student so please go ahead, tell me a bit about yourself, your education, how much USD your school charged you every term, along with what do you wish to study, your strengths and weaknesses, and your hobbies, since I honestly don't know a lot about you?

And with that a detailed description of your family background, what do your parents do *(Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work)?*, what is their highest education level along with if you have any siblings, please?
08/03/24, 3:02 pm - Harmehak: I am expecting your response, Tadiwanashe!
08/03/24, 3:33 pm - +263 78 973 2483: Good afternoon
08/03/24, 3:33 pm - +263 78 973 2483: Am Tadiwanashe D Khasha. I am a lady aged 20 years old .l was born on the 26th of December 2003.

08/03/24, 3:55 pm - +27 65 271 9279: Like the process
08/03/24, 3:59 pm - Harmehak: If the student and the parent remains active it usually takes 5-6 days.

08/03/24, 4:25 pm - +27 65 271 9279: <Media omitted>

08/03/24, 4:27 pm - Harmehak: Mrs Patricia, since the results have been out.

Didn't she happen to apply to other institutes as of yet?
08/03/24, 4:30 pm - +27 65 271 9279: She did apply,, but we were hoping she would get a scholarship,, because of our financial problems...
08/03/24, 4:30 pm - Harmehak: I do understand,

Where all did she apply?
08/03/24, 4:30 pm - +27 65 271 9279: In Zimbabwe
08/03/24, 4:31 pm - +27 65 271 9279: Local universities
08/03/24, 4:31 pm - Harmehak: Yes please, I am referring to the institutions.

For instance UZ, NUST, MSU.
08/03/24, 4:31 pm - +27 65 271 9279: MSU
08/03/24, 4:32 pm - Harmehak: Alright please and has she been accepted as well?
08/03/24, 4:33 pm - +27 65 271 9279: Yes,, she got accepted..
08/03/24, 4:34 pm - +27 65 271 9279: But because of financial issues,, she could not proceed
08/03/24, 4:49 pm - Harmehak: I do understand!
08/03/24, 4:49 pm - Harmehak: Mrs Patricia, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,

While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time. 

This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year. 

Wouldn't you agree to the same?
08/03/24, 4:50 pm - +27 65 271 9279: Yes  I agree
08/03/24, 4:51 pm - Harmehak: Mrs Patricia, now given the finances are less than those in Zimbabwe along with an opportunity like the Earn While You Learn Program.

Are you willing to support Tadiwanashe's education here in India both mentally and financially?
08/03/24, 4:53 pm - +27 65 271 9279: Yes,, m willing to support her,, if the finances are less as compared to Zimbabwe
08/03/24, 4:57 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate your support for your child!
08/03/24, 4:57 pm - +27 65 271 9279: That will be a great opportunity for my daughter to further her studies
08/03/24, 4:58 pm - Harmehak: Mrs Patricia, are you aware we are proudly associated with Glenview 1 high and we have students from the school in India as well?
08/03/24, 4:58 pm - Harmehak: Indeed please!
08/03/24, 5:00 pm - +27 65 271 9279: M not aware,, I learned about it when I got a message from you,, so I asked my daughter,, she told me she applied
08/03/24, 5:02 pm - Harmehak: Alright please!

Later in the stage I will connect you with a parent as well share regarding students from the school!
08/03/24, 5:02 pm - +27 65 271 9279: M so grateful for your association with Zimbabwe,, because a lot of students come from poor families,, just like my daughter
08/03/24, 5:02 pm - Harmehak: May I know more about her aspirations to study and become a Geomorphologist?
08/03/24, 5:03 pm - +27 65 271 9279: In my case,, I am a single parent,, so it's so hard for me to send her to university
08/03/24, 5:03 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate your kind words.
08/03/24, 5:03 pm - Harmehak: I do understand please.
08/03/24, 5:06 pm - +27 65 271 9279: She likes something to do with nature,, environment.. At high school she liked Geography

08/03/24, 5:10 pm - +27 65 271 9279: And also about the changing of weather,, climate change...
08/03/24, 5:18 pm - Harmehak: That's wonderful and well thought off, Mrs Patricia.
08/03/24, 5:19 pm - Harmehak: I can see she opted for Business Studies too,

May I know more about that?
08/03/24, 6:00 pm - +27 65 271 9279: She opted for business studies, because at o levels she did well in accounting,, so she opted for business studies geography and maths.. It was all determined by the subjects she excelled at Ordinary level
