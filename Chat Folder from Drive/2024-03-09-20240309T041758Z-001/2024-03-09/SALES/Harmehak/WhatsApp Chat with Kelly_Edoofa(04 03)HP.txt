08/03/24, 10:21 am - +263 78 321 3292: Alright Ma'am, thank you for the opportunity. I am girl aged 17 and an SDA.I live at Lower Gwelo Mission with my family. I learn at Lower Gwelo Adventist High School (also known as LOGAHS) and currently I'm doing my A'Level, as I'm looking forward to write my finals this year November. Our institution fees, termly is USD$150. I wish to study agricultural sciences so that we can improve the sector of agriculture. I like crop science which enhance our knowledge and skills on  how to produce adequate food for the people which comes forth with a balanced diet and so on. I've got challenges on some new concepts of some areas of study but i'm trying to grasp them. I love reading books, magazines or anything that talks about health and researching more on that because l'm a vegan. I also like nature, just seeing the wonders of God with my young sisters playing soft songs while enjoying ourselves. Briefly, that's all about me.

08/03/24, 10:56 am - Harmehak: Great!
08/03/24, 10:56 am - Harmehak: Well Kelly now as we proceed ahead, I would like to your thoughts on higher education abroad!

Do you believe it's a life changing decision?
08/03/24, 11:07 am - +263 78 321 3292: Yes l do. Studying abroad makes you know different aspects of life i.e cultural, social, economical and so forth. It helps in implementing new skills and knowledge in a particular place to make life better for everyone. This leads to a good knowledge of life. It's also good for pleasure, adventurer, entertainment. greener pastures etc
08/03/24, 11:08 am - +263 78 321 3292: adventure*
08/03/24, 11:09 am - Harmehak: That's well put across!

Would you add that you are mentally prepared for a life abroad too?
08/03/24, 11:09 am - +263 78 321 3292: Also good for educational purposes, I think so
08/03/24, 11:10 am - Harmehak: Kelly, I am delighted to see your dedication and I believe you would agree with me that commitment from your parents is equally important!

So now could you please share, if your parents are willing to support your higher education abroad mentally and financially?
08/03/24, 11:12 am - +263 78 321 3292: By God's Grace i'm prepared
08/03/24, 11:12 am - Harmehak: I appreciate,

Could you please share, if your parents are willing to support your higher education abroad mentally and financially?
08/03/24, 11:15 am - +263 78 321 3292: Yes I agree. My parents are willing to support me
08/03/24, 11:16 am - Harmehak: Alright please!
08/03/24, 11:16 am - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!
08/03/24, 11:18 am - +263 78 321 3292: Alright Ma'am, I got it. Thank you, I promise to do so.
08/03/24, 11:19 am - Harmehak: Great, so, can you share your O Level results with me for evaluation along with what motivates you to study your desired course?
08/03/24, 11:21 am - +263 78 321 3292: Do you need a screenshot? Unfortunately now I don't have, the documents are home and i'm at school
08/03/24, 11:22 am - Harmehak: I do understand!

Kindly share them later.
08/03/24, 11:23 am - +263 78 321 3292: Ummm, I had asked Mom take a pic for me
08/03/24, 11:25 am - Harmehak: I do understand please!

You can add your mother in the group as well.
