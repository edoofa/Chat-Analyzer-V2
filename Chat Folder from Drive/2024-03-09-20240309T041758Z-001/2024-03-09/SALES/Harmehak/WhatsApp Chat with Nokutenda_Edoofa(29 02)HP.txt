It was formed to help students with financial problems who were not able to attend their dreams. It became more active after the covid 19. The program is there to help students paying their fees hence it only forces on two purposes the affordability and employability. When we are saying it is affordable the give you the EWY project. These project will be doing them at the same time learning and earning something
05/03/24, 10:04 am - +263 77 444 6054: It is employble because the project they give you help you to develop your skills and to interact with people so that when you get employed on day you won't have a problem because you have been prepared for it

We are associated with more than 200 schools in Zimbabwe. Some of the most elite Schools in Zimbabawe example in Harare we are collaborated with St. Dominic’s Chishawasha, Dominican Convent, Christ Ministries and many others.

05/03/24, 11:47 am - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!
05/03/24, 11:49 am - +263 77 444 6054: Yes l am confident
05/03/24, 11:51 am - +263 77 444 6054: Can I ask when do you take your intakes
05/03/24, 11:54 am - Harmehak: August 2025.
05/03/24, 11:54 am - +263 77 444 6054: OK thank you
05/03/24, 11:55 am - Harmehak: I await your response please.
05/03/24, 11:57 am - +263 77 444 6054: What motivates me to study my desired course is that l get my chances to help others with the knowledge that I have studied
05/03/24, 11:59 am - Harmehak: Alright, I appreciate your noble thoughts,

So what all did you research about the same?
05/03/24, 12:01 pm - +263 77 444 6054: Right now I have two programs in mind
Social worker
Sport management and Coaching
05/03/24, 12:03 pm - Harmehak: Alright please,

Which out of the two are you more inclined towards?
05/03/24, 12:05 pm - +263 77 444 6054: It is Sport management and Coaching
05/03/24, 12:05 pm - +263 77 444 6054: How many points do you need for that
05/03/24, 12:08 pm - Harmehak: May I know more about your interests?
05/03/24, 12:09 pm - +263 77 444 6054: Im a person who is into sporting l myself l am a rugby player
05/03/24, 12:11 pm - Harmehak: That's interesting, 

However why did you pursue arts in your A level in that case?
05/03/24, 12:12 pm - +263 77 444 6054: It was a second option because l was looking for a school which has that problem
05/03/24, 12:12 pm - +263 77 444 6054: I mean program
05/03/24, 12:15 pm - Harmehak: I do understand, Nokutenda.
05/03/24, 12:16 pm - Harmehak: What are your thoughts on pursuing Law, Nokutenda?
05/03/24, 12:20 pm - +263 77 444 6054: Law is good but l  think Social worker is better
05/03/24, 12:22 pm - Harmehak: Alright, could you help me understand your thoughts on the same?
05/03/24, 12:22 pm - +263 77 444 6054: This message was deleted
05/03/24, 12:22 pm - +263 77 444 6054: This message was deleted
05/03/24, 12:24 pm - +263 77 444 6054: Social worker l would love to help those people who have been hurt, abuse and those who want to commit suicide
05/03/24, 12:25 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate your noble thoughts.
05/03/24, 12:26 pm - Harmehak: Now let me help you have a better understanding, social work is a great course at the current time. From my personal experience of being in the field of education, I see many students apply for the course, but being a very niche course, a lot of universities don't offer the same because the cost of the course is very high and since it's a practical course, and the ones who do they don't offer scholarships on the course as the investment to teach such a course to a number of students becomes very high for the university as well. 

Now usually what students do is, that they pursue a course that is similar to this particular course. A student can do all the related jobs without a degree of social work. A lot of time students pursue a course called Bachelor of Sociology. The base of this course and the base of social work as a course in similar in nature which is why students who pursue this course end up having career opportunities in the field of social work!
05/03/24, 12:26 pm - Harmehak: Social work and sociology have many similarities when it comes to career aspirations. For both professions, the main goal is to work with individuals, families, and communities to improve the quality of life and promote positive change. Both social work and sociology focus on understanding the causes of social problems and developing strategies to address them.

Social workers and sociologists use similar skills and approaches to help people, including interviewing, counseling, advocating, and providing support and resources. They also draw on research methods and theories to inform their practice and shape their interventions. For example, sociologists may conduct research on a particular population to gain a better understanding of how their environment, culture, and other factors influence their behavior and quality of life. This knowledge can then be applied to the development of social policy and change initiatives.

Both social workers and sociologists also strive to create a more equitable and just society. They recognize the importance of understanding and appreciating diversity, as well as the need to challenge oppression, discrimination, and social injustice. They work together to create an environment that values and respects all people, regardless of race, gender, class, or other factors.

Overall, social work and sociology have similar goals and approaches to promoting positive change. They both recognize the importance of understanding the root causes of social problems and developing strategies to address them. They also strive to create a more equitable and just society by challenging oppression, discrimination, and social injustice.
05/03/24, 12:26 pm - Harmehak: You can go through the same and inform me please
05/03/24, 12:31 pm - +263 77 444 6054: Yes l can see its a good program
05/03/24, 12:33 pm - Harmehak: So now shall I brief you about Bachelors in Sociology?
05/03/24, 12:33 pm - +263 77 444 6054: Yes you can

05/03/24, 1:14 pm - +263 77 444 6054: India is such a good country
05/03/24, 1:14 pm - Harmehak: Indeed, Nokutenda!

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
05/03/24, 1:16 pm - +263 77 444 6054: I'm not sure
05/03/24, 1:19 pm - Harmehak: Alright please!
05/03/24, 1:19 pm - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
05/03/24, 1:19 pm - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
05/03/24, 1:19 pm - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
05/03/24, 1:19 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
05/03/24, 1:24 pm - +263 77 444 6054: Owww l understand
05/03/24, 1:24 pm - Harmehak: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $2000-3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, 

Now *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

What are you thoughts on the same please?
05/03/24, 1:27 pm - +263 77 444 6054: It good and affordable
05/03/24, 1:31 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate!
05/03/24, 1:32 pm - Harmehak: Nokutenda, Senior Academician Mr Piyush were in Zimbabwe for about 90 days, from his experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,

While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time. 

This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year. 

Wouldn't you agree to the same?
05/03/24, 1:38 pm - +263 77 444 6054: Yes l do
05/03/24, 1:39 pm - Harmehak: So now are you in a better position to relate how Edoofa is making higher education affordable and accessible for international students in India, Nokutenda?
05/03/24, 1:47 pm - +263 77 444 6054: Yes I am
05/03/24, 1:48 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

Now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program in detail and how it would assist you.
05/03/24, 1:48 pm - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
05/03/24, 1:48 pm - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
05/03/24, 1:48 pm - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

05/03/24, 2:00 pm - +263 77 444 6054: These are all good things
05/03/24, 2:01 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate!
05/03/24, 2:01 pm - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
05/03/24, 2:15 pm - Harmehak: Do ensure active participation!
05/03/24, 2:22 pm - +263 77 444 6054: That would be the best
05/03/24, 2:24 pm - Harmehak: Indeed, Nokutenda!
05/03/24, 2:27 pm - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

05/03/24, 2:44 pm - Harmehak: That is great, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes. 

Are you ready?
05/03/24, 6:10 pm - Harmehak: I am expecting to hear from you Nokutenda
