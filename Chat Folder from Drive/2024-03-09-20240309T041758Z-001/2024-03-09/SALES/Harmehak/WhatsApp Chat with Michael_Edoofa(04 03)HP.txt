You don't know how happy i am🥳🥳🥳🥳
05/03/24, 2:00 pm - Harmehak: I am glad to know that!
05/03/24, 2:01 pm - +263 71 328 3819: So what's next
05/03/24, 2:01 pm - +263 71 328 3819: 😄😄
05/03/24, 2:02 pm - Harmehak: Michael, we understand you have gone through the Brochures and Flyers of the Edoofa Program.

To emphasize  *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and has been rewarding meritorious students to lower their Fee Structure less than what you will end up paying at the Local Zimbabwe University.
05/03/24, 2:06 pm - +263 71 328 3819: This sounds really amazing! I also heard the top 20 are offered  scholarships as well?
05/03/24, 2:07 pm - Harmehak: Okay so Michael, as we start discussing your results further, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 


Qualification to the ESAT Exam (Please note EDOOFA calculates your results based on the TOP performers' Score so it is the percentile that we will be evaluating on)
A Level and Previous Results 
*Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 
*Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these Four  significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
05/03/24, 2:17 pm - +263 71 328 3819: Yes
05/03/24, 2:17 pm - +263 71 328 3819: I have
05/03/24, 2:20 pm - Harmehak: Alright so Michael, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.

I would like to know you better as a student, so please go ahead, and tell me a bit about yourself, your education, what you wish to study, your strengths, your weaknesses, your hobbies, and a detailed description of your family background, *Where do your parents work (Place) in your country or any other country that they have relocated to due to work promises?  Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work) since I honestly don't know a lot about you?*
05/03/24, 2:34 pm - +263 71 328 3819: Okay great
05/03/24, 2:43 pm - Harmehak: I await your response!
05/03/24, 2:44 pm - +263 71 328 3819: My name is Michael T Mwerenga and I'm the eldest child in my family. I have two young siblings. I learnt at Mandedza High School which is a boarding school, both A and O level. I managed to score 9A's and 2B'sat form4  and 15 points ( Mathematics (A), Chemistry (A) and Physics (A) during my A levels. I wish to study medicine and surgeylry and my greatest strengths involve excellent Mathematical skills I also believe  to be a polymath.  My weaknesses as a person are : i am an introvert and I kinda find it hard to play an musical instrument though i haven't  seriously  tried one. I usually  read finance books during my free time or Meditate  on the Bible. But my favourite hobby  is watching  history documentaries.
05/03/24, 2:45 pm - Harmehak: Well received and well expressed Michael, Its a pleasure to know about you and your family!

I appreciate the honesty and transparency you have shown in expressing yourself!
05/03/24, 2:46 pm - +263 71 328 3819: Family background  

I am a warm-hearted brother of two young sisters. My father is a police officer at a local police station and my mother works at a beauty shop as a hairdresser. 
I was born at Seke South Maternity Clinic, after birth, my mother left for South Africa looking for a job and she became a hair stylist. I was left with my father at our modest home in Chitungwiza, Unit J. My father was a student police officer at that time, and his salary was hardly enough to support the family. My mother worked hard beyond the borders and sent necessities to my father's rescue, but to no avail, we constantly had break ins annually, given the neighborhood and absence of an older person to tend the home most of the time. 
I attended the nearest primary school to our home, Seke 7 Primary School. 
At my previous high school most of my friends called me a polymath, which brought me back to Benjamin Franklin, Leonardo DaVinci, and Elon Musk, who are some of the greatest polymaths who shaped and are shaping the world with their innovations. In my humble circumstances and despite the challenges of my parents making education a reality for me, I feel I can be able to achieve the best this life can offer. I dream myself becoming one of the greatest and humble anesthesiologist saving the people from complicated during and post-surgery pain. 
 My mother is now back in Zimbabwe given the social upheaval in South Africa, her earnings per month have dramatically decreased and my fathers health has deteriorated in the past 12 months; this all has become greater motivation for me to change my life and my family`s lives!
05/03/24, 2:46 pm - +263 71 328 3819: It's  a pleaseure sharing  these things with you.
05/03/24, 3:02 pm - Harmehak: It's a pleasure to know about them, Michael.
05/03/24, 3:04 pm - +263 71 328 3819: Great!
05/03/24, 3:04 pm - Harmehak: So, could you kindly tell me how much the school charges you every term, who in your family financially supports your education, and what profession they are in?
05/03/24, 3:05 pm - +263 71 328 3819: 450 USD and it's usually both of my parents.
05/03/24, 3:06 pm - +263 71 328 3819: Which they are currently  struggling  to raise anyway.
05/03/24, 3:10 pm - Harmehak: I do understand please.
05/03/24, 3:12 pm - Harmehak: Your resilience and determination in the face of adversity are truly admirable. Despite the challenges your family has faced, you've maintained a steadfast commitment to your education and your dreams.
05/03/24, 3:25 pm - +263 71 328 3819: Thank you😊
05/03/24, 3:25 pm - Harmehak: You're welcome!
05/03/24, 3:25 pm - Harmehak: Michael, as we proceed ahead, I had a question, during your introduction you mentioned you would like to study medicine, could you please share what motivates you behind this field of study?
05/03/24, 3:26 pm - +263 71 328 3819: Okay
05/03/24, 3:28 pm - +263 71 328 3819: Many healthcare personnel such as physicians, nurses, doctors, anaesthetists, and paramedics are often perceived by people as individuals with a primary objective to cure diseases and complicated injuries. However, my aspiration to become an anaesthetist is driven by a deeper purpose.

Growing up in my humble community, I had the privilege of interacting with health ministry personnel who came to educate us about hygiene and other health-related matters. These encounters, coupled with visits to the hospital, instilled in me a life purpose to inspire and pursue a successful career in healthcare. My goal is to be part of a team that saves people from public health threats, particularly suicides and addictions. I chose to become an anaesthetist because it requires a significant portion of my empathetic personality and active listening skills. These skills will enable me to interact with patients in a comforting and counseling manner. Comforting and counseling surgery patients is a crucial aspect of my work because psychological distress can delay wound healing and compromise immunity, leading to even more severe diseases.

As an anaesthetist, I understand that my influence will not be limited to the hospital. I also aim to work with organizations such as the Batsirai Health and Welfare Trust or the Population Service International to contribute to the health of my community.

Although anaesthetists have a good work-life balance, I realize that I will not have much free time. However, inspiring others to pursue good mental health is an integral part of my life's purpose. I aspire to create podcasts that highlight the significance of mental health, which could be broadcast on national radio. This is because most deaths due to suicides and addictions stem from a weak and poor mindset. Countries such as Sweden have proved to the world how great mental health podcats have impacted the mental health of their country.

Even though I may not have the opportunity to build hospitals, clinics, and research centres, which are part of my dream, I am confident that my passion for inspiring and becoming a healthcare professional is sufficient to make a positive impact on my community and my country, Zimbabwe.
05/03/24, 3:33 pm - +263 71 328 3819: So basically  if i do medicine  and Surgery  i will be able to upgrade  to become an anaesthetist. Which is the profession that my heart yearns for.
05/03/24, 3:40 pm - Harmehak: Your dedication to improving public health through empathy, active listening, and mental health advocacy is truly inspiring. This demonstrates a deep understanding of the importance of psychological well-being in overall health. Your commitment to community health initiatives and mental health awareness podcasts reflects a proactive approach to addressing public health challenges. 

Your journey in healthcare promises to be both impactful and fulfilling.
05/03/24, 3:41 pm - +263 71 328 3819: Thank you🙏
05/03/24, 3:42 pm - Harmehak: May I have your O and A level results in a picture format.
05/03/24, 3:42 pm - +263 71 328 3819: Okay wait
05/03/24, 3:43 pm - Harmehak: Sure please!
05/03/24, 3:43 pm - +263 71 328 3819: <Media omitted>
05/03/24, 3:45 pm - Harmehak: Great results, Michael!
05/03/24, 3:46 pm - +263 71 328 3819: <Media omitted>
05/03/24, 3:51 pm - Harmehak: Received please!
05/03/24, 3:52 pm - Harmehak: So what all did you happen to research about the requirements for Medicine, Michael!

What is your take on the importance of Biology to study medicine?
05/03/24, 3:53 pm - +263 71 328 3819: I dont think  it is that relevant.  What matters is my chemistry knowledge  and Mathematical skills(which would help me with reasoning)
05/03/24, 4:01 pm - Harmehak: I understand,

However don't you Biology is rather more important than Physics even in Zimbabwe?

Considering from my experience 90% of the students opt for MCB and not PCM.
05/03/24, 4:01 pm - Harmehak: Equally taking a notice that Biology is all about human and living beings and so is medicine.
05/03/24, 4:05 pm - +263 71 328 3819: Oh yes that is true. But with PCM see i can frankly do any science program.
05/03/24, 4:08 pm - Harmehak: I can understand!
05/03/24, 4:08 pm - Harmehak: Well, if you would have researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*. whereas if they want to study any Engineering Course then they should have *Physics, Chemistry and Maths* in their A level mandatorily.
05/03/24, 4:37 pm - +263 71 328 3819: Okay then, so I can take Electrical and electronics  if that is the case.
05/03/24, 4:39 pm - Harmehak: I do understand!
05/03/24, 4:39 pm - Harmehak: Now, majority of the time Zimbabwean students study subjects as per Zimbabwe's requirements, therefore, the only courses left that these students could pursue ahead which would also align with the healthcare sector are :

*1. Bachelor in Pharmacy*
*2. Bachelor in Optometry*
*3. Bachelor of Technology in Biomedical Engineering*
*4. Bachelor of Science in Medical Laboratory Technology*
*5. Bachelor of Science in Nutrition and Dietetics*
05/03/24, 4:39 pm - Harmehak: Along with the same you are eligible for Engineering Degrees.
05/03/24, 4:40 pm - +263 71 328 3819: I would prefer Electrical  and electronics  engineering instead
05/03/24, 6:58 pm - Harmehak: I would have loved to continue, however I would be scheduling your session for *tomorrow at 9:30 AM CAT*, as my working hours for the day are over and it's already been a long day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
05/03/24, 6:59 pm - +263 71 328 3819: Okay noted
05/03/24, 7:01 pm - Harmehak: Wishing you a blessed evening ahead.
05/03/24, 7:10 pm - +263 71 328 3819: Likewise , thank you😊
06/03/24, 9:30 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

07/03/24, 11:32 am - +263 71 328 3819: Yes it's  really interesting  and I'm  confident it's  the best for me.
07/03/24, 11:34 am - Harmehak: I am glad to know that Michael!

So far, do you have any queries for me?
07/03/24, 11:35 am - +263 71 328 3819: Yes, after doing the program I'm  able to apply to work in other countries  as well?
07/03/24, 11:36 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
07/03/24, 11:37 am - +263 71 328 3819: Thank you very much🙏
07/03/24, 11:45 am - Harmehak: Alright Michael, since you have understood the course, can you please tell me, if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself in 5 years and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
07/03/24, 11:48 am - +263 71 328 3819: Well, I see myself working for people, trying to make sure they get electricity in their homes and industries without difficulty. My dream will be to improve  to the postgraduate  status so that i would be able to know better about in the field of electricity
07/03/24, 11:50 am - Harmehak: That is really great Michael, I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations!

Now, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
07/03/24, 11:54 am - +263 71 328 3819: It's because, India is well known for producing best Engineers and I want to be part of them. However here in Zimbabwe, the degree which i would get will not be recognized  Internationally. Though  I would like to work for my country one day along the way.
07/03/24, 11:58 am - Harmehak: That is wonderful Michael, it's good to know of your thoughts to do well for your country.

Now as you know Edoofa Recommends India as a Higher Education destination.

*May I know what is your knowledge or what have you researched about India and Indian Education System which makes you feel that studying in India would help you achieve your dreams?*
07/03/24, 12:04 pm - +263 71 328 3819: Yes , Indian produces  best employees. If we look at the world's  best companies some of them are run by Indian professionals. Also India being the 3 largest economy it's  Educational  system has also improved.
07/03/24, 12:06 pm - Harmehak: That's very correct!
07/03/24, 12:06 pm - Harmehak: Alright please, let me add to it, you see over the past 6 years, the Edoofa Scholarship Program is only focused in India, because of the following reasons:

07/03/24, 12:08 pm - +263 71 328 3819: Great!!!
07/03/24, 12:14 pm - Harmehak: I am glad this intrigued you,

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
07/03/24, 12:19 pm - +263 71 328 3819: No, non of us are. Please help us know!
07/03/24, 12:22 pm - Harmehak: Sure please
07/03/24, 12:22 pm - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
07/03/24, 12:23 pm - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
07/03/24, 12:23 pm - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
07/03/24, 12:23 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
07/03/24, 12:32 pm - +263 71 328 3819: That is really great to know!
07/03/24, 12:35 pm - Harmehak: In simple words Michael, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
07/03/24, 12:35 pm - Harmehak: However as per my experience, I can share with you that *if you are able to perform and clear all these criteria with a high passing grade, you would be eligible for higher quantum of Scholarship*, in which you will just have to pay a minimal fee of *$1600-$2300*, Which would cover your entire fees be it food, accommodation, Tuition etc.
07/03/24, 12:41 pm - +263 71 328 3819: This really sounds great, it's  even cheaper comoared to Zimbabwe's tuition fees and accommodation.
07/03/24, 12:43 pm - Harmehak: Indeed please!
07/03/24, 12:44 pm - Harmehak: You see, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,

While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time. 

This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year. 

Wouldn't you agree to the same?
07/03/24, 12:50 pm - +263 71 328 3819: I would agree, that is true
07/03/24, 12:54 pm - Harmehak: Indeed!

Now comparing the costs I believe you must be in an even better place that how Edoofa is making higher education affordable and accessible for international students in India, isn't it?

Along with an opportunity like the Earn While You Learn Program.
07/03/24, 12:55 pm - +263 71 328 3819: Yes true, can please explain  more about this earn while you learn program
07/03/24, 12:57 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

Now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program in detail and how it would assist you.
07/03/24, 12:57 pm - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
07/03/24, 12:57 pm - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
07/03/24, 12:57 pm - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

07/03/24, 1:01 pm - +263 71 328 3819: So basically  I will be learning marketing  skills, is that correct?
07/03/24, 1:01 pm - Harmehak: Correct,

However with these projects you will also be earning credits equivalent to cash and reduce your fee.
07/03/24, 1:02 pm - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
07/03/24, 1:03 pm - +263 71 328 3819: Okay, so the work we do under the  EWYL program is advertising? Nothing else?
07/03/24, 1:06 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
07/03/24, 1:08 pm - +263 71 328 3819: Okay I get you now.
07/03/24, 1:17 pm - Harmehak: Did you go through the same as well?
07/03/24, 1:19 pm - +263 71 328 3819: What do you  mean?
07/03/24, 1:19 pm - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
07/03/24, 1:19 pm - Harmehak: Did you understand the same, Michael?
07/03/24, 1:20 pm - +263 71 328 3819: Okay yes I di
07/03/24, 1:20 pm - +263 71 328 3819: Did
07/03/24, 1:20 pm - Harmehak: Great!
07/03/24, 1:20 pm - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

07/03/24, 1:21 pm - +263 71 328 3819: Awesome
07/03/24, 1:24 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
07/03/24, 1:27 pm - +263 71 328 3819: Yes true , this really sounds great🕺🏽🎊
07/03/24, 1:28 pm - Harmehak: That is great,

So Michael, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes. 

Are you ready?
07/03/24, 1:28 pm - +263 71 328 3819: Yes I am
07/03/24, 1:29 pm - Harmehak: Michael as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
07/03/24, 1:29 pm - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
07/03/24, 1:30 pm - +263 71 328 3819: 1500 and above
07/03/24, 1:33 pm - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
07/03/24, 1:33 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
07/03/24, 1:33 pm - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
07/03/24, 1:34 pm - +263 71 328 3819: Oh, I doubt if my parent's will be able to come up with that anytime soon.
07/03/24, 1:35 pm - Harmehak: It's paid after you are found eligible.
07/03/24, 1:35 pm - Harmehak: This message was deleted
07/03/24, 1:37 pm - Harmehak: So for an Edoofian the Enrollment Fee would include:

*1. Guaranteed Scholarship*
*2. Application fee of all the Edoofa’s Associated Universities*
*3. Cost of Multiple Statement of Purposes drafted*
*4. Recommendation Letter drafted for the Student*
*5. Earn While You Learn Program’s Training*
*6. Visa Assistance*
*7. SLICE CON*
*8. Department of Student Welfare*
*9. Attachments and Internship Opportunities*

07/03/24, 1:39 pm - +263 71 328 3819: Great🙏😊
07/03/24, 1:40 pm - Harmehak: I believe everything was thoroughly explained in the event by Dr Gupta too, isn't it?
07/03/24, 1:40 pm - +263 71 328 3819: Tes, he was clear🙏
07/03/24, 1:50 pm - Harmehak: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
07/03/24, 1:50 pm - Harmehak: You see Edoofa's exceptional program has opened up a world of opportunities for aspiring students, garnering thousands of applications on a daily basis. The Eligibility Evaluation process ensures that deserving candidates are granted the chance to participate in the program. *Once accepted, students are requested to pay a nominal Program Fee of $350 within 7 days of receiving their acceptance letter*, following which they commence with their admission process and the esteemed Earn While You Learn Program. Edoofa's mission to provide quality education and support to students is at the heart of this initiative, and we are honored to make a difference in the lives of deserving individuals through this program.
07/03/24, 1:50 pm - Harmehak: Considering your results of ESAT we also offer an additional waiver of *USD 50* in your Enrollment Fee upon your consideration in the Slice Con 24 Committee Fund.


Out of a Total of 3000 students only 200 have been given this opportunity, as a counselor I feel it's a great privilege that has been offered to you.
07/03/24, 1:55 pm - +263 71 328 3819: Thank you very much, this is really great news🙏
07/03/24, 2:03 pm - Harmehak: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $100 within the next 30 days.*
07/03/24, 2:08 pm - Harmehak: You're very welcome
07/03/24, 2:34 pm - Harmehak: Did you follow the same, Michael?
07/03/24, 2:35 pm - +263 71 328 3819: Yes, i did
07/03/24, 2:36 pm - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
07/03/24, 2:36 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
07/03/24, 2:36 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in their country itself.
07/03/24, 2:36 pm - Harmehak: This message was deleted
07/03/24, 3:18 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now, Michael?
07/03/24, 3:59 pm - +263 71 328 3819: Yes i do
07/03/24, 4:02 pm - Harmehak: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
07/03/24, 4:02 pm - Harmehak: Basically, this registration fee ($500-$1000) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024-2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
07/03/24, 4:02 pm - Harmehak: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*

Here is a picture of the Visa of one of the Edoofian who arrived in India, for 2023 Academic Intake.
07/03/24, 4:02 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
07/03/24, 4:25 pm - +263 71 328 3819: To be honest this was a really nice offer. Given you have reduced the cost of studying  in India all the way from $6000 to $1500. But the reality  is we do not have all of this money required even though it's  just 1500. We are really underprivileged and I dont know if you can still continue  to help us. But that is the truth. The thing is we thought the scholarship  would cover almost all of these things but it's  really hard to find such scholarship. I'm truly sorry if all this sound as if I have been wasting  your time🙏
07/03/24, 4:28 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
07/03/24, 4:29 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
07/03/24, 4:38 pm - +263 71 328 3819: My family current situation would not even allow me to go and learn at UZ, in that case , I am currently  vulnerable  to taking  a gap year if there is no financial  aid. That's  why I came to seek the aid from Edoofa because my mother @263773637850 ( who is a hairdresser) is  the only source of income in the family , supporting 3 children - food and housing. This alone leaves no money for me to go to university. So I thought the top 20 for the esat would eventually  get a fully funded scholarship. To which im discovering  that, it's  not the case. That's  why I said , we are very underprivileged  to the extent that we wont be able to pay the $1500 under this situation. My father @263780038084 he is currently financially  disturbed being a police officer he has been charged with countless crimes, leading to his salary being frozen. This is the situation  at hand.
07/03/24, 4:48 pm - Harmehak: May I know regarding your acknowledgement earlier in that case, Michael?
07/03/24, 4:49 pm - Harmehak: I believe we have been discussing since the beginning that we offer 50-100% of scholarship and Accomodation.
07/03/24, 4:50 pm - +263 71 328 3819: Yes, the program is cheaper. But not for those who are heavily affected by the Zimbabwean economy. 

Thank you very much for your kind offer , but I'm afraid we wont be able to fulfill some of it's requirements.
07/03/24, 4:59 pm - Harmehak: Which requirements exactly are you referring to, Michael?

Speaking of Zimbabwean Economy, I believe you understand that the costs of education in Zimbabwe are only going to increase every year!
07/03/24, 5:00 pm - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
07/03/24, 5:00 pm - Harmehak: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)
07/03/24, 5:00 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
07/03/24, 5:02 pm - +263 71 328 3819: Thank you, let me see first.
07/03/24, 5:09 pm - +263 71 328 3819: The application, fees etcetera. 

But since my parents are in here  I'm sure we are going to discuss  about it and hopefully have a standing financial  plan about the matter. My situation  is really complicated  financially so I'm  sure it might take time. About a week or so given the offer is still valid!
07/03/24, 5:12 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
07/03/24, 5:18 pm - +263 71 328 3819: No I wont be able to accomplish  the same here in Zimbabwe. 

Perhaps we can continue  with the counseling  and when the time comes where im required  to do the payments I'm  sure a plan will be there beforehand.
07/03/24, 5:19 pm - Harmehak: I do understand.

While it's important for you to understand that any payment is made only after you are found eligible and you receive an acceptance letter.
07/03/24, 5:20 pm - +263 71 328 3819: Noted✅️
07/03/24, 5:46 pm - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
07/03/24, 5:46 pm - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
07/03/24, 5:46 pm - Harmehak: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

*Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage.*
A fact that draws our attention is that, according to his position in life, an extravagant man is either admired or loathed. A successful business man does nothing to increase his popularity by being prudent with his money. A person who is wealthy is expected to lead a luxurious life and to be lavish with his hospitality. If he is not so, he is considered mean, and his reputation in business may even suffer in consequence. The paradox remains that he had not been careful with his money in the first place; he would never have achieved his present wealth.
Among the low income group, a different set of values exists. The young clerk, who makes his wife a present of a new dress when he has not paid his house rent, is condemned as extravagant. Carefulness with money to the point of meanness is applauded as a virtue. Nothing in his life is considered more worthy than paying his bills. The ideal wife for such a man separates her housekeeping money into joyless little piles – so much for rent, for food, for the children’s shoes, she is able to face the milkman with equanimity every, month satisfied with her economizing ways , and never knows the guilt of buying something she can’t really afford .
As for myself, I fall neither of these categories. If I have money to spare I can be extravagant, but when, as is usually the case, I am hard up and then I am the meanest man imaginable.

1. Which of the following would be the most appropriate title for the passage
a)The cause of poverty is extravagance.
b)Stingy habits of the poor.
c)Being extravagant is always condemnable.
d)Extravagance is a part of the rich as well as of the poor.

2.According to the passage the person, who is a successful businessman and wealthy
a)Is more popular if he appears to be wasting away his time.
b)Is expected to have lavish lifestyle.
c)Must be extravagant before achieving success.
d)Should not bother about popularity.

3. The phrase ‘lavish with his hospitality’ in the third sentence of the first paragraph means
a)Extravagance in entertaining guest.
b)Unconcerned in treating his friends and relatives.
c)Thoughtful in spending only on guests and strangers.
d)Stinginess in dealing with his relatives.

4.The word ‘paradox’ in the last sentence of the first paragraph means
a)A word that brings out the hidden meaning
b)Statement based on facts
c)a statement that seems self-contradictory but in reality expresses a possible truth.
d)Statement based on the popular opinion

5.What is the meaning of the word “equanimity”?
a)Calmness
b)Discomposure
c)Equivocal

Whey to Go Greek yogurt—a strained form of cultured yogurt—has grown enormously in popularity in the United States since it was first introduced in the country in the late 1980s. From 2011 to 2012 alone, sales of Greek yogurt in the US increased by 50 percent.
