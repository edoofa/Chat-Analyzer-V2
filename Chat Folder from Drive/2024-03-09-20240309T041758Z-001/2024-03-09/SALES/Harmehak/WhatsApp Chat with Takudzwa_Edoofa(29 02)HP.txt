I understood that Edoofa  is a  program that offers scholarships to students all over the world
05/03/24, 9:40 am - Harmehak: Well received, now, let me share more about the program with you.

You see, *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4000 students from different African countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
05/03/24, 9:41 am - Harmehak: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program. 
We are associated with more than 200 schools in Zimbabwe. Some of the most elite Schools in Zimbabawe example in Harare we are collaborated with St. Dominic’s Chishawasha, Dominican Convent, Christ Ministries and many others. In Manicaland we have a total of 18 Schools to name a few St. David’s Girls Bonda, Hartzell High, First Class, First Choice and so on.  Chipinge we have Chibuwe High School, you would be happy to know that the DEO’s of Mutare and Chipinge have their kids under the Edoofa Scholarship. Masvingo we have 24 Schools collaborated with over 300 students from some of the best schools example Pamushana, St. Antony’s, Reformed Church Gutu, Zaka High and many others. The program is also appreciated by the Education Inspector of Bikita Madam Makomeke.We have more than 500 students from Mashonaland (West, Central and East) Province, Midlands Province.  Last but not the Least we also have Schools from Bulawayo and Matebaland South associated with Edoofa. 

Our collaborations with the UCE College Bulawayo adds a feather to the Cap of trust that Edoofa has built in a span of 14 years. 

The Schools, Institutions and Educationists who have made efforts to train the students for this prestigious Scholarship Program are also the Authorized Designatories of EDOOFA in Zimbabawe. 
We have Mr. Shorwi Kawadza (Retd. Headmaster Hartzell), Mr. Charles Jerera (Retd. Ministry of Education), Ms. Christina Rockson (Founder and Principal of Hilltop Christian College in SA) who have shown relentless efforts to guide students on the right path to success.EDOOFA boasts a proud students and parents community of more than 2000 from Zimbabwe who are happy with the quality of education and the employability outcomes.
05/03/24, 9:43 am - +263 71 315 7120: Okay thank you
05/03/24, 9:43 am - Harmehak: I feel you too are looking for something like this, so that just like these students you can cater for your higher education by your own self and help your parents reduce their financial burden, isn't it?
05/03/24, 9:45 am - +263 71 315 7120: Yes l am!!
05/03/24, 9:49 am - Harmehak: *Alright so Takudzwa, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.*

I would like to know you better as a student so please go ahead, tell me a bit about yourself, your education, how much USD your school charges you every term, along with what do you wish to study, your strengths and weaknesses, and your hobbies, since I honestly don't know a lot about you?

And with that a detailed description of your family background, what do your parents do *(Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work)?*, what is their highest education level along with if you have any siblings, please?
05/03/24, 10:04 am - +263 71 315 7120: I am a boy aged 19 who is a Upper 6 student at Seke 1 High school. We  pay one hundred and ten USD every term. I love reading novels, textbooks and gardening as my hobbies
I am in a family of 4, two children and I am the last born. My parents are self employed
05/03/24, 10:08 am - Harmehak: Well received Takudzwa, Its a pleasure to know about you and your family!

May I know more about your siblings and your parent's profession?
05/03/24, 10:17 am - +263 71 315 7120: I have a sister who did her O level in 2017 and my as for my parents, my father owns a liquor store and my mother is a tailor

05/03/24, 10:32 am - Harmehak: Alright please
05/03/24, 10:32 am - Harmehak: So what exactly do you wish to study for your higher education?
05/03/24, 7:02 pm - Harmehak: I was expecting your response, now I would be scheduling your session for *tomorrow at 9:30 AM CAT*, as my working hours for the day are over and it's already been a long day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
05/03/24, 7:04 pm - +27 68 062 3124: He  may not reply you in time because of school
06/03/24, 9:33 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
06/03/24, 9:33 am - Harmehak: You too can participate please.
06/03/24, 9:42 am - +27 68 062 3124: Okay
06/03/24, 9:44 am - +27 68 062 3124: I wanted to know what are your requirements for him to qualify for the scholarship
06/03/24, 9:47 am - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!
06/03/24, 10:08 am - +27 68 062 3124: Okay thank you
06/03/24, 10:18 am - Harmehak: Were you able to follow the discussion yesterday as well please?

06/03/24, 10:26 am - Harmehak: Could you please share Takudzwa O level result and A level subject combination?
06/03/24, 10:30 am - +27 68 062 3124: When you qualify do you provide accommodation also
06/03/24, 10:33 am - +27 68 062 3124: I'm at work now I don't have a picture of the results but but for  A level he is doing agriculture maths economics
06/03/24, 10:36 am - Harmehak: The program offers 50-100% scholarship on tuition fee please.

06/03/24, 11:32 am - +27 68 062 3124: Something that has to do with agriculture or food industry

If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
08/03/24, 11:04 am - +263 71 315 7120: Yes

What are the requirements for medicine or healthcare as per your understanding or research please?
08/03/24, 1:03 pm - +263 71 315 7120: Ooh yes one need them yah for sure but l didn't have biology and chemistry, 
Biology l had a D symbol and as for Chemistry mh previous school didn't have a lab for chemistry <This message was edited>
08/03/24, 1:06 pm - Harmehak: While I do understand!

These are mandatory requirement for medicine and health sciences in Zimbabwe!
08/03/24, 1:06 pm - Harmehak: Since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*. whereas if they want to study any Engineering Course then they should have *Physics, Chemistry and Maths* in their A level mandatorily.
08/03/24, 1:09 pm - +263 71 315 7120: Okay I do understand
08/03/24, 1:10 pm - +263 71 315 7120: <Media omitted>
08/03/24, 1:11 pm - Harmehak: That's good!

So may I know why exactly you chose your current combination and what motivates you for your desired course?
08/03/24, 1:11 pm - Harmehak: I understand, however requirements are very strict in India considering you would require Biology for any degree related to healthcare.
08/03/24, 1:12 pm - +263 71 315 7120: Okay sir
08/03/24, 1:14 pm - Harmehak: I am Ms Harmehak.
