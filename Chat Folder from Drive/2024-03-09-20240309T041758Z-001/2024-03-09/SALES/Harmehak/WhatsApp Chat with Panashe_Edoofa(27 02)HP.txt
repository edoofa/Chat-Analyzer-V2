04/03/24, 4:32 pm - Harmehak: Well in the final year of the course every student in the University gets multiple chances of securing a good job within India itself as all the Universities have Employment Partners which provide students with good paying job!

You see the whole purpose of the Earn While You Learn Program is to make the students of Edoofa so competent that by the time they reach the final year of their education, they should be able to get good job opportunities.

04/03/24, 6:13 pm - Harmehak: I didn't get you Panashe!

I believe you understand that your question has a broad approach.

What exactly are you referring to?
05/03/24, 9:32 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

I am expecting your response, Panashe!
05/03/24, 9:39 am - +263 78 508 1014: The period they give to secure a job after your student visa expires?
05/03/24, 9:42 am - Harmehak: Like I mentioned Panashe,

05/03/24, 10:07 am - Harmehak: Well Panashe, now as we proceed ahead, I would like to your thoughts on higher education abroad!

Do you believe it's a life changing decision?
05/03/24, 10:08 am - +263 78 508 1014: Not sure i have doubt
05/03/24, 10:13 am - Harmehak: Don't you believe moving to a new country is a life changing decision, Panashe?
05/03/24, 10:14 am - +263 78 508 1014: It depends with the country and life changing opportunities it has to offer
05/03/24, 10:14 am - +263 78 508 1014: Let's take for instance you moving from India to Somalia is that life changing for you?
05/03/24, 10:15 am - Harmehak: Panashe, are we currently in my or your counseling session?
05/03/24, 10:16 am - Harmehak: Initially I would like to highlight for you that your entire responses will be evaluated.

05/03/24, 10:17 am - Harmehak: I am Ms Harmehak.
05/03/24, 10:18 am - +263 78 508 1014: Ok sry ma'am
05/03/24, 10:30 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
05/03/24, 10:33 am - +263 78 508 1014: Yes its a very huge life changing opportunity as it increases your chances to be successful and concentration into your work and studies.
05/03/24, 10:34 am - Harmehak: Correct!

So would you add that you are mentally prepared for a life abroad too?
05/03/24, 10:37 am - +263 78 508 1014: Yea I can say yes to that but I don't know does it ever feels lonely sometimes I mean you will be far away from family support and comfort?
05/03/24, 10:40 am - Harmehak: I do understand, however, you get to meet students from India and Zimbabwe along with experiencing different cultures, getting more opportunities, learning new things along with exploring the country.

Along with the same the internet facilities help you be connected with your family.
05/03/24, 10:41 am - +263 78 508 1014: Yea that sounds wonderful
05/03/24, 10:44 am - Harmehak: I appreciate!
05/03/24, 10:44 am - Harmehak: Panashe, I am delighted to see your dedication and I believe you would agree with me that commitment from your parents is equally important!

So now could you please share, if your parents are willing to support your higher education abroad mentally and financially?
05/03/24, 10:45 am - +263 78 508 1014: Ok will tell you if they approve
05/03/24, 10:50 am - Harmehak: Didn't you happen to discuss with them in advance?
05/03/24, 11:08 am - +263 78 508 1014: I discussed with them but they are not yet aware about this new conversations we had today
05/03/24, 11:10 am - Harmehak: While I understand,

Do you believe your higher education will require financial support from your parents?
05/03/24, 11:12 am - +263 78 508 1014: I don't think they will be able to afford it
05/03/24, 11:12 am - Harmehak: Who has been supporting your education so far, Panashe?
05/03/24, 11:13 am - +263 78 508 1014: My dad buh its been quite difficult
05/03/24, 11:17 am - Harmehak: Alright, so how exactly are you planning your higher education?
05/03/24, 11:18 am - +263 78 508 1014: Can you cancel the application
05/03/24, 11:22 am - Harmehak: May I know the reason behind the same, Panashe?
05/03/24, 11:23 am - Harmehak: Having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,

While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time. 

This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year. 

Wouldn't you agree to the same?
05/03/24, 11:24 am - +263 78 508 1014: Yes i agree with you
05/03/24, 11:24 am - +263 78 508 1014: My parents just don't think its the best decision
05/03/24, 11:27 am - Harmehak: So are your parents prepared to support you financially in Zimbabwe?

Or are they willing to support your higher education in India less than the costs in Zimbabwe?
05/03/24, 7:03 pm - Harmehak: Are we connected, Panashe?
05/03/24, 7:34 pm - +263 78 508 1014: Yes ma'am I will get back to you as soon as possible after their final decision
06/03/24, 9:32 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!
06/03/24, 9:32 am - Harmehak: Can you please elaborate?
06/03/24, 11:45 am - +263 78 508 1014: After my parents decision
06/03/24, 11:47 am - Harmehak: I understand Panashe!

However did you discuss the same with them?
06/03/24, 11:47 am - +263 78 508 1014: Still discussing
06/03/24, 12:13 pm - Harmehak: What has been the discussion so far, Panashe?
06/03/24, 1:26 pm - +263 78 508 1014: About the difference between the fees
06/03/24, 1:30 pm - Harmehak: Alright!

Are you aware of the Earn While You Learn Program, Panashe?
06/03/24, 1:30 pm - +263 78 508 1014: No tell me more
06/03/24, 1:34 pm - Harmehak: While we will discuss the same in detail, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
06/03/24, 1:36 pm - +263 78 508 1014: That's sounds great
06/03/24, 1:52 pm - Harmehak: So what exactly do you wish to study Panashe?
06/03/24, 1:53 pm - +263 78 508 1014: Mechanical engineering
06/03/24, 1:54 pm - Harmehak: Alright and what motivates you for the same?
06/03/24, 1:55 pm - +263 78 508 1014: I want to be involved in fixing and creating new machines that can make the world a better place
06/03/24, 2:13 pm - Harmehak: Oh alright please,

Did you ever happen to research about the requirements for Engineering in India?
06/03/24, 2:13 pm - +263 78 508 1014: Not yet
06/03/24, 2:30 pm - Harmehak: Well, if you would have researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*. whereas if they want to study any Engineering Course then they should have *Physics, Chemistry and Maths* in their A level mandatorily.
06/03/24, 2:54 pm - +263 78 508 1014: Ok
06/03/24, 3:01 pm - Harmehak: What have you understood so far, Panashe?
06/03/24, 3:02 pm - +263 78 508 1014: Everything about the requirements
06/03/24, 3:41 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so far what all would you like to ask?
06/03/24, 6:42 pm - +263 78 508 1014: What are the requirements needed for an Actural Scientist
06/03/24, 8:05 pm - Harmehak: You can pursue the same.
06/03/24, 8:05 pm - Harmehak: I was expecting your response earlier, now I would be scheduling your session for *tomorrow at 9:30 AM CAT*, as my working hours for the day are over and it's already been a long day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.
07/03/24, 10:49 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

Excuse me for the delay due to an emergency.

I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
07/03/24, 12:07 pm - +263 78 508 1014: Ok
07/03/24, 12:14 pm - Harmehak: Did you happen to discuss with your parents?
08/03/24, 3:01 pm - Harmehak: Hello everyone, I hope you are in good health.

Since the time you applied for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, I have been expecting proper participation, for your application for Edoofa Scholarship Program, but since you didn’t respond, I am afraid I will have to put a formal closure to your application.
