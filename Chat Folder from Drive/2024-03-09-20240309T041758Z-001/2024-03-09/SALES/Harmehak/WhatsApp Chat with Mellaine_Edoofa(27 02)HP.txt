05/03/24, 11:11 am - Harmehak: Well Mellaine now as we proceed ahead, I would like to your thoughts on higher education abroad!

Do you believe it's a life changing decision?
05/03/24, 11:18 am - +263 78 952 2612: Studying abroad  can be indeed a life changing  decision.
05/03/24, 11:23 am - Harmehak: Very well, and would you add that you are mentally prepared for a life abroad too?
05/03/24, 11:33 am - +263 78 952 2612: Absolutely,i am mentally prepared for life abroad as it is the crucial aspect to consider when pursuing higher education in a foreign country
05/03/24, 11:37 am - Harmehak: Mellaine, I am delighted to see your dedication and I believe you would agree with me that commitment from your parents is equally important!

So now could you please share, if your family members are aware of your plans to study abroad and if they are willing to support your higher education abroad mentally and financially?
05/03/24, 11:43 am - +263 78 952 2612: Yes my parents are aware of my studies  on a foreign  country  and they are willing to support my higher  education abroad  mentally and financially
05/03/24, 11:46 am - Harmehak: I appreciate, Mellaine.
05/03/24, 11:47 am - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!
05/03/24, 11:54 am - +263 78 952 2612: Oky yes  i have confidence
05/03/24, 11:54 am - Harmehak: That's good.
05/03/24, 11:54 am - Harmehak: So, can you share your O Level results and A level subject combination with me for evaluation along with what motivates you to study your desired course?
05/03/24, 11:58 am - +263 78 952 2612: I have six subjects of O level and at A level I'm  doing sociology ,shona literature and frs(family and religious studies )
05/03/24, 11:59 am - Harmehak: Duly noted.
05/03/24, 11:59 am - Harmehak: Kindly address the other half.
05/03/24, 12:03 pm - +263 78 952 2612: Frs ,geography ,computers
05/03/24, 12:07 pm - Harmehak: Noted.

However, may I know what exactly do you wish to pursue for your higher education?
05/03/24, 7:03 pm - Harmehak: I was expecting your response, now I would be scheduling your session for *tomorrow at 9:30 AM CAT*, as my working hours for the day are over and it's already been a long day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

06/03/24, 8:16 pm - +263 78 952 2612: As an AI language model, I don't have personal plans or aspirations. However, individuals often pursue higher education for various reasons, such as career advancement, personal growth, intellectual development, and the pursuit of specific passions or interests. The choice of field of study and the decision to pursue higher education are deeply personal and can be influenced by a wide range of factors, including career goals, personal interests, and societal expectations.
06/03/24, 8:16 pm - +263 78 952 2612: I as an individual I  want to pursue higher education for various reasons such as career advancement,personal growth,intellectual development and the pursuit of specific passions or interests .
