05/03/24, 9:36 am - Harmehak: So now can you please tell me, what is your understanding of the Edoofa Scholarship Program and what all did you happen to learn from your friend?
05/03/24, 9:40 am - +263 77 899 9940: It's a program based in India that offers partial and full schorlaships to international students to get the chance to  study in India
05/03/24, 9:41 am - Harmehak: Well received, now, let me share more about the program with you.

You see, *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4000 students from different African countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
05/03/24, 9:41 am - Harmehak: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program. 
We are associated with more than 200 schools in Zimbabwe. Some of the most elite Schools in Zimbabawe example in Harare we are collaborated with St. Dominic’s Chishawasha, Dominican Convent, Christ Ministries and many others. In Manicaland we have a total of 18 Schools to name a few St. David’s Girls Bonda, Hartzell High, First Class, First Choice and so on.  Chipinge we have Chibuwe High School, you would be happy to know that the DEO’s of Mutare and Chipinge have their kids under the Edoofa Scholarship. Masvingo we have 24 Schools collaborated with over 300 students from some of the best schools example Pamushana, St. Antony’s, Reformed Church Gutu, Zaka High and many others. The program is also appreciated by the Education Inspector of Bikita Madam Makomeke.We have more than 500 students from Mashonaland (West, Central and East) Province, Midlands Province.  Last but not the Least we also have Schools from Bulawayo and Matebaland South associated with Edoofa. 

Our collaborations with the UCE College Bulawayo adds a feather to the Cap of trust that Edoofa has built in a span of 14 years. 

The Schools, Institutions and Educationists who have made efforts to train the students for this prestigious Scholarship Program are also the Authorized Designatories of EDOOFA in Zimbabawe. 
We have Mr. Shorwi Kawadza (Retd. Headmaster Hartzell), Mr. Charles Jerera (Retd. Ministry of Education), Ms. Christina Rockson (Founder and Principal of Hilltop Christian College in SA) who have shown relentless efforts to guide students on the right path to success.EDOOFA boasts a proud students and parents community of more than 2000 from Zimbabwe who are happy with the quality of education and the employability outcomes.
05/03/24, 9:45 am - +263 77 899 9940: Noted
05/03/24, 9:49 am - Harmehak: I feel you too are looking for something like this, so that just like these students you can cater for your higher education by your own self and help your parents reduce their financial burden, isn't it?
05/03/24, 9:49 am - +263 77 899 9940: Yes
05/03/24, 9:50 am - Harmehak: *Alright so Tavonga, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.*

I would like to know you better as a student so please go ahead, tell me a bit about yourself, your education, how much USD your school charges you every term, along with what do you wish to study, your strengths and weaknesses, and your hobbies, since I honestly don't know a lot about you?

And with that a detailed description of your family background, what do your parents do *(Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work)?*, what is their highest education level along with if you have any siblings, please?
05/03/24, 9:52 am - +263 77 899 9940: Okay let get to it
05/03/24, 9:56 am - Harmehak: Sure please
05/03/24, 10:11 am - +263 77 899 9940: So my name is Tavonga Jason Chinhenzva son of  Wilfred and Pedina Chinhenzva. I am the second born in a family of three and the only boy.

I did my O level and A level both at St Paul's Musami High School. In O level i had 4A's & 5B's and in A level i had 12 points while studying sciences. My combination for A level was Math's, Physics and Chemistry.
The school was $510  per term. I wish to study Civil Engineering in University. My strengths are that i am good listener, hard working , persistent, easy to make conversation with. My weaknesses are yet to be known as i am ver adaptable to situations. 
My go to hobby is soccer.
I have 2 sisters , one who is in her final year of university and the other now in Grade 6. My parents are both currently unemployed but due to side businesses still manage to cater for our needs but it does get tough some times.
05/03/24, 10:21 am - Harmehak: Well received and well expressed Tavonga, Its a pleasure to know about you and your family!

I appreciate the honesty and transparency you have shown in expressing yourself!
05/03/24, 10:28 am - +263 77 899 9940: Welcome
05/03/24, 10:33 am - Harmehak: Kindly share your O and A level results in a picture format.
05/03/24, 10:37 am - +263 77 899 9940: <Media omitted>
05/03/24, 10:38 am - +263 77 899 9940: <Media omitted>
05/03/24, 10:41 am - Harmehak: Received please, Tavonga!
05/03/24, 10:42 am - Harmehak: So your sister is currently at which university?
05/03/24, 10:42 am - +263 77 899 9940: University of Zimbabwe
05/03/24, 10:42 am - Harmehak: Alright please.

So didn't you yourself happen to apply to UZ?
05/03/24, 10:43 am - +263 77 899 9940: I did
05/03/24, 10:43 am - Harmehak: Alright, may I know more regarding the same?

If you were accepted or what your plans to pursue education in India or Zimbabwe?
05/03/24, 10:45 am - +263 77 899 9940: So far i hve been accepted by NUST but my target is pursue education where it's both convinient for me and my parents be it in Zimbabwe or outside of Zimbabwe
05/03/24, 10:50 am - Harmehak: I understand!
05/03/24, 10:50 am - Harmehak: You see, Tavonga, Senior Academician Mr. Piyush was in Zimbabwe for about 90 days. He had the privilege of meeting many Zimbabwean students who had applied for the Edoofa Program back in 2018-2019. However, at that time, they didn't proceed because they were enticed by the prospect of earning quick money in the country. This year, when they met him, they shared how difficult things have been for them. Some of them, despite holding reputed degrees from UZ, MSU, and HIT, are working as petrol attendants, while others have started careers as mobile/laptop repair technicians. Some were facing even more challenges, resorting to selling Ecocash, Simcards, or vegetables.

Observing this scenario, Mr. Piyush saw many of them regretting not seizing the opportunity when they had the chance. What is your take on the same?
05/03/24, 10:57 am - +263 77 899 9940: Yes indeed situations do arise in which means do not meet targets just because of missed opportunities. And at the same time there is no guarantee that studying else would brought about a different outcome. There even cases in which someone studies abroad but still does get the back through they hoped for. At the end of the it comes down to persistentance to meet your goals and hard work not where you actually studied.
05/03/24, 10:59 am - Harmehak: While I understand what you are sharing,

I hope you are aware that India is known for its Medical and Engineering sector, Tavonga?
05/03/24, 11:00 am - +263 77 899 9940: Yes indeed it's one of the best if not the best
05/03/24, 11:01 am - Harmehak: Indeed,

While we will discuss the remaining benefits as well,

May I know what motivates you to study Civil Engineering?
05/03/24, 11:08 am - +263 77 899 9940: Mostly it's the employment rate. 
Not is it easier to get a job but at the same it provides you with multiple chances to find a job abroad as infrastructural development is taking place every where in the world
05/03/24, 11:10 am - Harmehak: I do appreciate the honesty,

So what all did you research about the course?

Along with the same are you aware of anyone working in this field?
05/03/24, 11:17 am - +263 77 899 9940: The course ranges from 4 to 5 years of completion
It's both hands on and theoratical
I don't know anyone working within the field
05/03/24, 11:17 am - Harmehak: Alright please,

Let me brief you about the course.
05/03/24, 11:17 am - +263 77 899 9940: Okay
05/03/24, 11:19 am - Harmehak: *B.Tech Civil Engineering: What is it About?*

Civil engineering is one of the oldest engineering disciplines in the world. Civil engineering, until a few decades back, was a much sought after course among Indian students, but lately has been sidelined due to the software and IT boom. However with the increasing need to develop and maintain India’s infrastructure, which is lagging in all aspects, this field is bouncing back strongly.

There are options for higher studies after the completion of B.Tech. course. Students can pursue Master’s degree in specialized course. Master of Technology (M.Tech.) in Civil engineering and other allied branches like-

*Structural Engineering*
*Architectural Engineering*
*Geotechnical Engineering*
*Environmental Engineering etc.*

*B.Tech Civil Engineering: Who should opt?*

Before you decide to pursue your undergraduate studies in this field, it is important to understand that Civil engineering is not just about buildings and bridges. If you are under the assumption that all that civil engineers do is wear a yellow helmet and supervise workers in construction sites, then you are yet to understand the true capacity of this field. 


*Career aspects*

In these cases, you will have to hunt for a core engineering job all by yourself through off-campus placements. Creating strong professional networks, developing a great resume with stellar GPA and doing impressive projects and internships will help you secure a job in one of the core civil engineering companies.

Also, civil engineers find work not just in construction industry, but also in other industries such as oil and energy, transportation, petroleum, environmental, power and electric utilities, chemical etc where infrastructure projects and construction facilities are involved. Some students transition to software, consulting or banking as they feel that salary and growth prospects are better in these sectors.
05/03/24, 11:21 am - +263 77 899 9940: Thank you
05/03/24, 11:21 am - Harmehak: You can have a thorough reading and inform me once done.
05/03/24, 11:21 am - +263 77 899 9940: Okay
05/03/24, 11:22 am - Harmehak: Yes please
05/03/24, 11:25 am - +263 77 899 9940: Done thank you for the detailed information
05/03/24, 11:26 am - Harmehak: You're very welcome
05/03/24, 11:26 am - Harmehak: Alright Tavonga, since you have understood the course, can you please tell me, if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself in 5 years and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
05/03/24, 11:29 am - +263 77 899 9940: In the next 5 years i see my self being employed in a stable job.
Being accepted will give that extra exposure needed for someone to have a different perspective to life and at same might open up avenues that aren't accessible here
05/03/24, 11:30 am - Harmehak: That is really great Tavonga, I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations!

Now, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
05/03/24, 11:34 am - +263 77 899 9940: Studying abroad is chance to be in a different environment in which you learn different aspects of life and at the same being given a challenge to adapt and be your own person.
It gives me the opportunity to explore possibilities that i couldn't in here and connect with people from different places
05/03/24, 11:35 am - Harmehak: I can see you are aiming at maximum exposure, equally it's good that you are making efforts for a promising future, Tavonga.

Now as you know Edoofa Recommends India as a Higher Education destination.

*May I know what is your knowledge or what have you researched about India and Indian Education System which makes you feel that studying in India would help you achieve your dreams?*
05/03/24, 11:37 am - +263 77 899 9940: Most engineers working across the world in countries like USA & Australia were are holders of degree's that they persued in India
05/03/24, 11:38 am - Harmehak: Very correct!
05/03/24, 11:38 am - Harmehak: Alright please, let me add to it, you see over the past 6 years, the Edoofa Scholarship Program is only focused in India, because of the following reasons:

*1. Robust Education System:* India boasts the world's third-largest education system, comprising 1000+ universities and 39,931 colleges. This extensive infrastructure provides students with a diverse range of educational opportunities.

2. *Renowned Institutions:* India is home to highly rated institutions known for their academic excellence and quality of education. Students can choose from a wide range of disciplines, including politics, philosophy, engineering, medical sciences, biology, business, and media/journalism.

05/03/24, 11:44 am - +263 77 899 9940: Thank you for the insight
05/03/24, 11:45 am - Harmehak: You're very welcome,

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
05/03/24, 11:45 am - +263 77 899 9940: No
05/03/24, 11:49 am - Harmehak: Alright please
05/03/24, 11:49 am - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
05/03/24, 11:49 am - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
05/03/24, 11:49 am - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
05/03/24, 11:49 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
05/03/24, 11:55 am - +263 77 899 9940: Noted
05/03/24, 11:55 am - Harmehak: In simple words Tavonga, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
05/03/24, 11:55 am - Harmehak: However as per my experience, I can share with you that *if you are able to perform and clear all these criteria with a high passing grade, you would be eligible for higher quantum of Scholarship*, in which you will just have to pay a minimal fee of *$1600-$2300*, Which would cover your entire fees be it food, accommodation, Tuition.
05/03/24, 11:55 am - Harmehak: What are your thoughts on the same?
05/03/24, 12:01 pm - +263 77 899 9940: That is wonderful
05/03/24, 12:02 pm - Harmehak: Tavonga, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,

While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time. 

This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year. 

Wouldn't you agree to the same?
05/03/24, 12:03 pm - +263 77 899 9940: I would
05/03/24, 12:04 pm - Harmehak: So now are you in a better position to relate how Edoofa is making higher education affordable and accessible for international students in India, Tavonga?

Along with an opportunity like the Earn While You Learn Program.
05/03/24, 12:05 pm - +263 77 899 9940: Yes
05/03/24, 12:06 pm - +263 77 899 9940: Thank you for the insight can continue tomorrow?
05/03/24, 12:06 pm - Harmehak: May I know the reason behind the same, Tavonga?
05/03/24, 12:07 pm - +263 77 899 9940: Have to go somewhere
05/03/24, 12:08 pm - Harmehak: While I understand,

I believe you would agree that counseling session is important as well, isn't it?

We are moving towards the conclusion stage itself.
05/03/24, 12:08 pm - +263 77 899 9940: Yes it is
05/03/24, 12:09 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

Now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program in detail and how it would assist you.
05/03/24, 12:09 pm - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
05/03/24, 12:09 pm - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
05/03/24, 12:09 pm - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

05/03/24, 12:11 pm - Harmehak: You're welcome
05/03/24, 12:12 pm - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
05/03/24, 12:15 pm - +263 77 899 9940: That's wonderful
05/03/24, 12:15 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate, Tavonga
05/03/24, 12:15 pm - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

05/03/24, 12:18 pm - Harmehak: You have to go through the resources as well, Tavonga.

So far, what are your thoughts on the entire discussion?
05/03/24, 12:18 pm - Harmehak: Do you believe you can get such an opportunity in Zimbabwe please?
05/03/24, 12:19 pm - +263 77 899 9940: The programs is great and very beneficiary
05/03/24, 12:20 pm - Harmehak: That is great, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes. 

Are you ready?
05/03/24, 12:20 pm - +263 77 899 9940: Can we do this tomorrow my battery is low
05/03/24, 12:21 pm - Harmehak: I understand,

However you can get back later as well.
05/03/24, 12:21 pm - +263 77 899 9940: Okay
05/03/24, 12:21 pm - +263 77 899 9940: Thank you
05/03/24, 12:22 pm - Harmehak: We are only 20 minutes from concluding the discussion.

I would appreciate if you would participate today itself,

By when shall I expect to hear from you?
05/03/24, 12:22 pm - +263 77 899 9940: Later in the day
05/03/24, 12:23 pm - Harmehak: By when exactly, Tavonga?
05/03/24, 12:24 pm - +263 77 899 9940: 6 pm
05/03/24, 12:24 pm - Harmehak: I believe you must be aware that by then it's 9:30 PM in India.
05/03/24, 12:25 pm - +263 77 899 9940: Okay maybe same time as today tomorrow
05/03/24, 12:26 pm - Harmehak: Tavonga, like I mentioned we are left with 20 minutes to conclude the discussion.

May I know your actual challenge currently?
05/03/24, 12:44 pm - Harmehak: Mrs Pedina, did you happen to follow the discussion today please?
05/03/24, 1:12 pm - +263 77 252 2129: Good day Sir 

I I did thank you for the insight
05/03/24, 1:13 pm - Harmehak: That's great!
05/03/24, 1:13 pm - Harmehak: I am Ms Harmehak please.
05/03/24, 1:14 pm - +263 77 252 2129: My bad
05/03/24, 1:15 pm - Harmehak: I understand!
05/03/24, 1:15 pm - Harmehak: What is your take on the discussion so far?
05/03/24, 1:17 pm - +263 77 252 2129: Funds permitting this is a very good opportunity
05/03/24, 1:19 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate,

I believe you must be in a better position to relate how this is more affordable since you already do have a child in UZ, isn't it?
05/03/24, 1:35 pm - +263 77 252 2129: Per semester fees is around USD$1300 but if you using local currency depending on the interbank prevailing rate it can be cheaper
05/03/24, 1:38 pm - Harmehak: Indeed, like I shared earlier please, it's expensive in Zimbabwe.
05/03/24, 1:38 pm - Harmehak: However $1600-2300 a year here in India includes Tuition fee, Accomodation and Food along with an opportunity like the Earn While You Learn Program.
05/03/24, 1:41 pm - +263 77 252 2129: This can be workable especially if it comes to $1600 or less the only challenge is a guaranteed stable income
05/03/24, 1:42 pm - Harmehak: Can you elaborate, Mrs Pedina?
05/03/24, 1:44 pm - +263 77 252 2129: I mean at the moment we don't have a stable income
05/03/24, 1:45 pm - +263 77 252 2129: But would really really Tavonga to pursue this route
05/03/24, 1:45 pm - Harmehak: I do understand, However you would agree that higher education is important.
05/03/24, 1:45 pm - Harmehak: Along with that he can get an opportunity like Earn While You Learn Program.
05/03/24, 1:46 pm - +263 77 252 2129: Without a doubt
05/03/24, 1:46 pm - Harmehak: I am glad!
05/03/24, 1:46 pm - Harmehak: Mrs Pedina, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
05/03/24, 1:46 pm - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
05/03/24, 1:55 pm - +263 77 252 2129: I do hear you but I think only those who can afford can apply to different Universities abroad, for some of us that money will channelled towards fees and accommodation 

Here application fee is $20 then when selected that's when you will know the fees depending with the program
05/03/24, 1:57 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
05/03/24, 2:01 pm - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
05/03/24, 2:01 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
05/03/24, 2:01 pm - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
05/03/24, 2:04 pm - Harmehak: You see, Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. 

I hope now you have a better clarity?
05/03/24, 2:09 pm - +263 77 252 2129: Thank you
05/03/24, 2:09 pm - Harmehak: That's amazing, so now that you have understood how Edoofa makes the application process affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
05/03/24, 2:09 pm - Harmehak: Now as you can see, because of such an amazing opportunity that Edoofa provides to its students, Edoofa receives thousands of applications on a  daily basis out of which Eligibility Evaluation takes place as I did share with you above, so only if the student is found eligible for the program and get their Acceptance Letter, *they will have to pay the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Acceptance Letter after which they start with their admission process and the Earn While You Learn Program.*
05/03/24, 2:09 pm - Harmehak: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
05/03/24, 2:15 pm - +263 77 252 2129: Oooooo I see
05/03/24, 2:15 pm - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
05/03/24, 2:15 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
05/03/24, 2:15 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in their country itself.
05/03/24, 2:15 pm - Harmehak: This message was deleted
05/03/24, 2:44 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now, Mrs Pedina?
05/03/24, 4:25 pm - Harmehak: Have you followed?

@263778999940 @263772522129
05/03/24, 4:41 pm - +263 77 899 9940: Yes
05/03/24, 4:49 pm - Harmehak: Alright
05/03/24, 4:50 pm - Harmehak: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
05/03/24, 4:50 pm - Harmehak: Basically, this registration fee ($500-$1000) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024-2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
05/03/24, 4:50 pm - Harmehak: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*

Here is a picture of the Visa of one of the Edoofian who arrived in India, for 2023 Academic Intake.
05/03/24, 4:50 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
05/03/24, 4:55 pm - +263 77 899 9940: Noted
05/03/24, 5:04 pm - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
05/03/24, 5:04 pm - Harmehak: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)
05/03/24, 5:04 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
05/03/24, 5:11 pm - +263 77 899 9940: Okay
05/03/24, 6:59 pm - Harmehak: Do request your parents to connect with Mrs Ruth as well!
05/03/24, 7:04 pm - +263 77 899 9940: Okay
05/03/24, 8:38 pm - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
05/03/24, 8:38 pm - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
05/03/24, 8:38 pm - Harmehak: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

06/03/24, 12:15 pm - +263 77 269 8398: Tried to talk to Ruth but she was travelling coz I wanted to hear from  a parent before we commit      ourselves
06/03/24, 12:16 pm - Harmehak: I can understand.

You can have a direct call as well once she is available.
06/03/24, 12:17 pm - Harmehak: We are associated with more than 200 schools in Zimbabwe. Some of the most elite Schools in Zimbabawe example in Harare we are collaborated with St. Dominic’s Chishawasha, Dominican Convent, Christ Ministries and many others. In Manicaland we have a total of 18 Schools to name a few St. David’s Girls Bonda, Hartzell High, First Class, First Choice and so on.  Chipinge we have Chibuwe High School, you would be happy to know that the DEO’s of Mutare and Chipinge have their kids under the Edoofa Scholarship. Masvingo we have 24 Schools collaborated with over 300 students from some of the best schools example Pamushana, St. Antony’s, Reformed Church Gutu, Zaka High and many others.

We have Mr. Shorwi Kawadza (Retd. Headmaster Hartzell), Mr. Charles Jerera (Retd. Ministry of Education), Ms. Christina Rockson (Founder and Principal of Hilltop Christian College in SA) who have shown relentless efforts to guide students on the right path to success.EDOOFA boasts a proud students and parents community of more than 2000 from Zimbabwe who are happy with the quality of education and the employability outcomes.
06/03/24, 12:18 pm - Harmehak: Are you aware of the recent events that took place in Martin Luther King Junior School in February, 2024?
06/03/24, 12:19 pm - +263 77 269 8398: She is travelling and she says she can talk to  me 6pm Zimbabwe time
06/03/24, 12:21 pm - Harmehak: Sure please!
06/03/24, 12:21 pm - +263 77 269 8398: Not really. Tavonga has told me a few things about you
06/03/24, 12:21 pm - Harmehak: This message was deleted
06/03/24, 12:22 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
06/03/24, 12:24 pm - Harmehak: Have a glimpse of the events. Let me tell you, Zimbabwe treated the team really well and they were overjoyed by the care of the people. 

The seminar and tests took place at the school from 17-19th February.
06/03/24, 12:25 pm - +263 77 269 8398: Oh noted with thanks
06/03/24, 12:30 pm - Harmehak: You're very welcome please!
06/03/24, 12:30 pm - Harmehak: Are you aware of either of the authorities, please?
06/03/24, 12:32 pm - +263 77 269 8398: Yaa some schools you named i am aware of them
06/03/24, 12:32 pm - Harmehak: That's great!

While the schools are associated, we have students from those schools currently in India too.
06/03/24, 12:33 pm - Harmehak: Just like you must have seen the video of Mrs Ruth's daughters, <This message was edited>
06/03/24, 12:33 pm - +263 77 269 8398: Yaa I watched the video
06/03/24, 12:35 pm - Harmehak: I am glad to know that!

So far, what all would you like to ask from me regarding the program or the discussion we had yesterday?
06/03/24, 12:38 pm - +263 77 269 8398: I have no questions. Our challenge is the money. We are only affording to put food on the table just that.
06/03/24, 12:40 pm - Harmehak: Mr Wilfred, like I was discussing with Tavonga yesterday!

Don't you believe you have already been spending $1500 a year on his secondary education?

While there are other expenses like food, transport, basic expense for school and facilities like internet that must be nothing less than $1000-$1500 a year?
06/03/24, 12:47 pm - +263 77 269 8398: Yes but we had like a payment structure where we could pay every month something until we finish before end of term or semester
06/03/24, 12:48 pm - Harmehak: While I do understand, Mr Wilfred!

What is your take on the requirements for higher education for a child for tertiary education, since you already have one in UZ?
06/03/24, 12:48 pm - Harmehak: Having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3500-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,

While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time. 

This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year.
06/03/24, 12:49 pm - +263 77 269 8398: You pay in advance but it has been very hard we are always in debt trying to balance
06/03/24, 12:51 pm - Harmehak: What would be your conclusion considering you would spend only more after every passing year as there is constant inflation in Zimbabwe?

While here in India Tavonga has the opportunity for the costs that are between say $1600-2300 that includes tuition fee, food, accommodation and basic university expenses!

Along with that an opportunity like the Earn While You Learn Program in a country that is known for its education for healthcare and engineering,
06/03/24, 12:52 pm - Harmehak: Considering the same itself I believe you have been investing on your children for proper education so that they can build a promising future, isn't it?
06/03/24, 12:56 pm - +263 77 269 8398: Thats why we are having this conversation
06/03/24, 12:56 pm - Harmehak: Very correct, Mr Wilfred!
06/03/24, 12:57 pm - Harmehak: So did you also happen to follow the discussion regarding the Earn while you learn program and how the same would help you and Tavonga?
06/03/24, 12:57 pm - +263 77 269 8398: I need to understand more on it
06/03/24, 12:58 pm - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
06/03/24, 12:59 pm - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
06/03/24, 12:59 pm - Harmehak: Mr Wilfred, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.
06/03/24, 1:00 pm - +263 77 269 8398: I understand now
06/03/24, 1:01 pm - +263 77 269 8398: We do appreciate your time you are taking to explain all this
06/03/24, 1:01 pm - Harmehak: I am glad to know that!
06/03/24, 1:02 pm - Harmehak: You're very welcome!

_*This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
06/03/24, 1:02 pm - Harmehak: So as of now, what else would you like to ask?
06/03/24, 1:03 pm - +263 77 269 8398: All we want is the best for Tavonga so that we can have peace of mind.
06/03/24, 1:03 pm - +263 77 269 8398: No questions
06/03/24, 1:04 pm - Harmehak: I can definitely understand that thought of a parent to see their children do well!
06/03/24, 1:05 pm - Harmehak: While you can also connect with Mrs Ruth today evening!

As of now, shall we proceed ahead with the discussion for today?
06/03/24, 1:06 pm - +263 77 269 8398: OK we can
06/03/24, 1:13 pm - Harmehak: Okay so in that case, I would like to ask you a few questions, but before that with immense pleasure, I would like to share the glimpses of the Africa Visit of our Founders which took place in June 2023! 

*It was a much-awaited event and they were welcomed by Ministries, Educationalists, Edoofians, and Parents across different African Countries. This is a must-watch video depicting the Acceptance of the Program in the African Continent, especially in Zimbabwe!!*
06/03/24, 1:13 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>

06/03/24, 3:52 pm - Harmehak: Alright please!

*Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage.*
A fact that draws our attention is that, according to his position in life, an extravagant man is either admired or loathed. A successful business man does nothing to increase his popularity by being prudent with his money. A person who is wealthy is expected to lead a luxurious life and to be lavish with his hospitality. If he is not so, he is considered mean, and his reputation in business may even suffer in consequence. The paradox remains that he had not been careful with his money in the first place; he would never have achieved his present wealth.
Among the low income group, a different set of values exists. The young clerk, who makes his wife a present of a new dress when he has not paid his house rent, is condemned as extravagant. Carefulness with money to the point of meanness is applauded as a virtue. Nothing in his life is considered more worthy than paying his bills. The ideal wife for such a man separates her housekeeping money into joyless little piles – so much for rent, for food, for the children’s shoes, she is able to face the milkman with equanimity every, month satisfied with her economizing ways , and never knows the guilt of buying something she can’t really afford .
As for myself, I fall neither of these categories. If I have money to spare I can be extravagant, but when, as is usually the case, I am hard up and then I am the meanest man imaginable.

1. Which of the following would be the most appropriate title for the passage
a)The cause of poverty is extravagance.
b)Stingy habits of the poor.
c)Being extravagant is always condemnable.
d)Extravagance is a part of the rich as well as of the poor.

2.According to the passage the person, who is a successful businessman and wealthy
a)Is more popular if he appears to be wasting away his time.
b)Is expected to have lavish lifestyle.
c)Must be extravagant before achieving success.
d)Should not bother about popularity.

3. The phrase ‘lavish with his hospitality’ in the third sentence of the first paragraph means
a)Extravagance in entertaining guest.
b)Unconcerned in treating his friends and relatives.
c)Thoughtful in spending only on guests and strangers.
d)Stinginess in dealing with his relatives.

4.The word ‘paradox’ in the last sentence of the first paragraph means
a)A word that brings out the hidden meaning
b)Statement based on facts
c)a statement that seems self-contradictory but in reality expresses a possible truth.
d)Statement based on the popular opinion

5.What is the meaning of the word “equanimity”?
a)Calmness
b)Discomposure
c)Equivocal
d)Dubious

Whey to Go Greek yogurt—a strained form of cultured yogurt—has grown enormously in popularity in the United States since it was first introduced in the country in the late 1980s. From 2011 to 2012 alone, sales of Greek yogurt in the US increased by 50 percent. The resulting increase in Greek yogurt production has forced those involved in the business to address the detrimental effects that the yogurt-making process may be having on the environment. Fortunately, farmers and others in the Greek yogurt business have found many methods of controlling and eliminating most environmental threats. Given these solutions as well as the many health benefits of the food, the advantages of Greek yogurt Q5. outdo the potential drawbacks of its production.Sentence [1] The main environmental problem caused by the production of Greek yogurt is the creation of acid whey as a by-product.Sentence [2] Because it requires up to four times more milk to make than conventional yogurt does, Greek yogurt produces larger amounts of acid whey, which is difficult to dispose of.Sentence [3] To address the problem of disposal, farmers have found a number of uses for acid whey. Sentence[4] They can add it to livestock feed as a protein Q.6. supplement, and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt.Sentence[5] If it is improperly introduced into the environment, acid-whey runoff Q.7. can pollute waterways, depleting the oxygen content of streams and rivers as it decomposes. Sentence [6] Yogurt manufacturers, food Q.8. scientists; and government officials are also working together to develop additional solutions for reusing whey.

6.supplement, and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt.
A) NO CHANGE
B) supplement and convert it into gas to use as fuel in electricity production.
