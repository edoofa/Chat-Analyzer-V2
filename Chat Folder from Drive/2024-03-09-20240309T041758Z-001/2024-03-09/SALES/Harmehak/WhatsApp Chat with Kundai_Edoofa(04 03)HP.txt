You can address me as *Ms. Harmehak and we do have with us, Mr. Piyush who is the Head of Counseling and Mr. Jyotishman who is the Head of Admissions* and will be evaluating your responses for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
05/03/24, 2:24 pm - Harmehak: Kundai, I understand that you were a part of the grand event and presentation by the esteemed Founders of the Edoofa Program Mr. Angad Singh and Mr. Avreen Singh. 

*Your results for the ESAT 2024 is 62/100*

Congratulations for Sailing Through!
05/03/24, 2:30 pm - +263 78 899 9828: Thank you
05/03/24, 2:33 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate!

So Spiwe, we understand you have gone through the Brochures and Flyers of the Edoofa Program.
To emphasize  *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and has been rewarding meritorious students to lower their Fee Structure less than what you will end up paying at the Local Zimbabwe University.
05/03/24, 2:45 pm - +263 78 899 9828: Yes
05/03/24, 2:50 pm - Harmehak: Okay so Kundai, as we start discussing your results further, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 


Qualification to the ESAT Exam (Please note EDOOFA calculates your results based on the TOP performers' Score so it is the percentile that we will be evaluating on)
A Level and Previous Results 
*Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 
*Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these Four  significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
05/03/24, 3:45 pm - Harmehak: Do ensure active participation, Kundai!
05/03/24, 5:07 pm - +263 78 899 9828: Yes I do
05/03/24, 6:58 pm - Harmehak: I would have loved to continue, however I would be scheduling your session for *tomorrow at 9:30 AM CAT*, as my working hours for the day are over and it's already been a long day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
05/03/24, 7:04 pm - +263 78 899 9828: Okay noted, thank you for your time

06/03/24, 12:13 pm - +263 78 899 9828: Okay following
06/03/24, 12:13 pm - Harmehak: Did you have a thorough reading, Kundai?
06/03/24, 12:18 pm - +263 78 899 9828: Yes
06/03/24, 12:25 pm - Harmehak: So would you like to pursue the same, Kundai?
06/03/24, 12:25 pm - +263 78 899 9828: Yes it is in line with what I want to do.
06/03/24, 12:29 pm - Harmehak: That's a wonderful course that you have settled for, I also have access to the Feedback form that you filled out after the session with your parents and I hope you are aware, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
06/03/24, 1:09 pm - Harmehak: In simple words Kundai, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
06/03/24, 1:10 pm - +263 78 899 9828: Okay can you explain further about the earn while you learn programme
06/03/24, 1:13 pm - Harmehak: However as per my experience, since you have a valid ESAT Score with decent High School Results, as per your interaction with the Board of Directors at Edoofa you surely will be rewarded with higher quantum of scholarship after which the average annual fee for you could be somewhere between $1200-$1800, now this , and even *After this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
06/03/24, 1:23 pm - +263 78 899 9828: Alright
06/03/24, 1:24 pm - Harmehak: What are your thoughts on the same, Kundai?
06/03/24, 1:33 pm - +263 78 899 9828: So are you saying that based on my ESAT score my tuition fee will be reduced to between  $1200 to $1800... is it?
06/03/24, 1:33 pm - +263 78 899 9828: And if I do the earn while you earn it will continue reducing
06/03/24, 1:47 pm - Harmehak: Yes please, Kundai!

However $1200-1800 in inclusive of tuition fee, food and accomodation.
06/03/24, 1:58 pm - +263 78 899 9828: Okay that's really great
06/03/24, 2:00 pm - Harmehak: I hope it was quite evident during the Videos played during the presentations that you attended the students working on the Internships and Attachments of the much coveted EArn While You Learn Program manage to earn USD 50- USD 100 Each however since there is no limit to earning students like Persistence Muza were able to also self finance the Cost of Education though students like these are less but I am sure you are highly motivated!
06/03/24, 2:03 pm - +263 77 300 0039: soo this much is for how long
06/03/24, 2:11 pm - +263 78 899 9828: Okay okay
06/03/24, 2:12 pm - Harmehak: Annual fee, please.
06/03/24, 2:12 pm - Harmehak: What all do you recall regarding the EWYL Program, Kundai?
06/03/24, 2:19 pm - +263 78 899 9828: I know that students work but the money they will be earning if used to fund their tuition fee
06/03/24, 2:21 pm - Harmehak: Let me provide you a better clarity
06/03/24, 2:21 pm - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
06/03/24, 2:21 pm - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
06/03/24, 2:27 pm - +263 78 899 9828: So it is some kind of internship is it?
06/03/24, 2:31 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
06/03/24, 2:46 pm - +263 78 899 9828: Alright
06/03/24, 2:47 pm - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $1800 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$600 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $50-$60 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
06/03/24, 2:52 pm - +263 78 899 9828: Okay
06/03/24, 2:53 pm - Harmehak: Alright Kundai, I hope you remember Dr. Gupta discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your parents were informed regarding the same, so will they be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education?
06/03/24, 2:55 pm - +263 78 899 9828: Yes please
06/03/24, 2:57 pm - Harmehak: Great, I hope you also remember Dr. Gupta also shared about the Enrollment Fee of USD 350 that EDOOFA charges upfront, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
06/03/24, 3:10 pm - +263 78 899 9828: Yes
06/03/24, 3:42 pm - Harmehak: So for an Edoofian the Enrollment Fee would include:

*1. Guaranteed Scholarship*
*2. Application fee of all the Edoofa’s Associated Universities*
*3. Cost of Multiple Statement of Purposes drafted*
*4. Recommendation Letter drafted for the Student*
*5. Earn While You Learn Program’s Training*
*6. Visa Assistance*
*7. SLICE CON*
*8. Department of Student Welfare*
*9. Attachments and Internship Opportunities*
06/03/24, 4:10 pm - Harmehak: Do ensure active participation, Kundai!
06/03/24, 4:15 pm - +263 78 899 9828: Okay following
06/03/24, 4:29 pm - Harmehak: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
06/03/24, 4:29 pm - Harmehak: You see Edoofa's exceptional program has opened up a world of opportunities for aspiring students, garnering thousands of applications on a daily basis. The Eligibility Evaluation process ensures that deserving candidates are granted the chance to participate in the program. *Once accepted, students are requested to pay a nominal Program Fee of $350 within 7 days of receiving their acceptance letter*, following which they commence with their admission process and the esteemed Earn While You Learn Program. Edoofa's mission to provide quality education and support to students is at the heart of this initiative, and we are honored to make a difference in the lives of deserving individuals through this program.
06/03/24, 4:29 pm - Harmehak: Considering your results of ESAT we also offer an additional waiver of *USD 50* in your Enrollment Fee upon your consideration in the Slice Con 24 Committee Fund.


Out of a Total of 3000 students only 200 have been given this opportunity, as a counselor I feel it's a great privilege that has been offered to you.
06/03/24, 4:53 pm - +263 78 899 9828: That's wonderful thank you very much
06/03/24, 5:04 pm - Harmehak: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $100 within the next 30 days.*
06/03/24, 5:06 pm - +263 78 899 9828: Yes that is fair because economic instability is a huge challenge
Very true
06/03/24, 5:06 pm - Harmehak: I do understand please.
06/03/24, 5:07 pm - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
06/03/24, 5:07 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
06/03/24, 5:07 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in their country itself.
06/03/24, 5:07 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
06/03/24, 5:11 pm - +263 78 899 9828: Yes please
06/03/24, 5:13 pm - Harmehak: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
06/03/24, 5:13 pm - Harmehak: Basically, this registration fee ($500-$1000) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024-2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
06/03/24, 5:13 pm - Harmehak: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*

Here is a picture of the Visa of one of the Edoofian who arrived in India, for 2023 Academic Intake.
06/03/24, 5:13 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
06/03/24, 5:17 pm - +263 78 899 9828: Are we the one's who are supposed to pay the registration fee
06/03/24, 5:17 pm - +263 78 899 9828: Okay noted
06/03/24, 5:18 pm - Harmehak: Basically, this registration fee ($500-$1000) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024-2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
06/03/24, 5:20 pm - Harmehak: Yes, however it's not a separate fee and will be waived off from your first year tuition fee itself.
06/03/24, 5:20 pm - +263 78 899 9828: Okay
06/03/24, 5:57 pm - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
06/03/24, 5:57 pm - Harmehak: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)
06/03/24, 5:57 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
06/03/24, 5:59 pm - +263 78 899 9828: Okay I hope she can be able to clarify some things
06/03/24, 8:05 pm - Harmehak: Sure please
06/03/24, 8:06 pm - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
06/03/24, 8:06 pm - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*

*Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage.*
A fact that draws our attention is that, according to his position in life, an extravagant man is either admired or loathed. A successful business man does nothing to increase his popularity by being prudent with his money. A person who is wealthy is expected to lead a luxurious life and to be lavish with his hospitality. If he is not so, he is considered mean, and his reputation in business may even suffer in consequence. The paradox remains that he had not been careful with his money in the first place; he would never have achieved his present wealth.
Among the low income group, a different set of values exists. The young clerk, who makes his wife a present of a new dress when he has not paid his house rent, is condemned as extravagant. Carefulness with money to the point of meanness is applauded as a virtue. Nothing in his life is considered more worthy than paying his bills. The ideal wife for such a man separates her housekeeping money into joyless little piles – so much for rent, for food, for the children’s shoes, she is able to face the milkman with equanimity every, month satisfied with her economizing ways , and never knows the guilt of buying something she can’t really afford .
As for myself, I fall neither of these categories. If I have money to spare I can be extravagant, but when, as is usually the case, I am hard up and then I am the meanest man imaginable.

1. Which of the following would be the most appropriate title for the passage
a)The cause of poverty is extravagance.
b)Stingy habits of the poor.
c)Being extravagant is always condemnable.
d)Extravagance is a part of the rich as well as of the poor.

2.According to the passage the person, who is a successful businessman and wealthy
a)Is more popular if he appears to be wasting away his time.
b)Is expected to have lavish lifestyle.
c)Must be extravagant before achieving success.
d)Should not bother about popularity.

3. The phrase ‘lavish with his hospitality’ in the third sentence of the first paragraph means
a)Extravagance in entertaining guest.
b)Unconcerned in treating his friends and relatives.
c)Thoughtful in spending only on guests and strangers.
d)Stinginess in dealing with his relatives.

4.The word ‘paradox’ in the last sentence of the first paragraph means
a)A word that brings out the hidden meaning
b)Statement based on facts
c)a statement that seems self-contradictory but in reality expresses a possible truth.
d)Statement based on the popular opinion

5.What is the meaning of the word “equanimity”?
a)Calmness
b)Discomposure
c)Equivocal
d)Dubious

Whey to Go Greek yogurt—a strained form of cultured yogurt—has grown enormously in popularity in the United States since it was first introduced in the country in the late 1980s. From 2011 to 2012 alone, sales of Greek yogurt in the US increased by 50 percent. The resulting increase in Greek yogurt production has forced those involved in the business to address the detrimental effects that the yogurt-making process may be having on the environment. Fortunately, farmers and others in the Greek yogurt business have found many methods of controlling and eliminating most environmental threats. Given these solutions as well as the many health benefits of the food, the advantages of Greek yogurt Q5. outdo the potential drawbacks of its production.Sentence [1] The main environmental problem caused by the production of Greek yogurt is the creation of acid whey as a by-product.Sentence [2] Because it requires up to four times more milk to make than conventional yogurt does, Greek yogurt produces larger amounts of acid whey, which is difficult to dispose of.Sentence [3] To address the problem of disposal, farmers have found a number of uses for acid whey. Sentence[4] They can add it to livestock feed as a protein Q.6. supplement, and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt.Sentence[5] If it is improperly introduced into the environment, acid-whey runoff Q.7. can pollute waterways, depleting the oxygen content of streams and rivers as it decomposes. Sentence [6] Yogurt manufacturers, food Q.8. scientists; and government officials are also working together to develop additional solutions for reusing whey.

6.supplement, and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt.
A) NO CHANGE

The question of whether many Africans have poor diets due to stagnant and inefficient farms is a complex issue that involves various factors. It is true that some African countries face challenges in agriculture, such as limited access to modern farming techniques, inadequate infrastructure, and climate change impacts. These factors can contribute to stagnant and inefficient farms, which may affect food production and availability.

However, it is essential to consider that the issue of poor diets in Africa is multifaceted and cannot be solely attributed to farm inefficiency. Other factors, such as poverty, lack of access to nutritious foods, limited education on proper nutrition, and food insecurity, also play a significant role in shaping dietary patterns in African communities.

Efforts are being made to address these challenges through initiatives that promote sustainable agriculture, improve access to resources and technology, and enhance nutrition education. By addressing the root causes of poor diets in Africa holistically, progress can be made towards ensuring food security and improving the overall health and well-being of the population.

In conclusion, while farm stagnation and inefficiency may contribute to poor diets in some African regions, it is crucial to consider the broader context of factors influencing dietary patterns. By addressing these challenges comprehensively, sustainable solutions can be developed to improve food security and nutrition outcomes in Africa.

My inspirational story

Once upon a time, there was a young girl named Maya who lived in a small village. Maya had big dreams of becoming a doctor and helping people in need. However, her family was very poor, and they could not afford to send her to school.

Despite the challenges she faced, Maya never gave up on her dream. She spent hours reading books borrowed from the local library and learning from anyone willing to teach her. She worked hard in the fields during the day and studied late into the night by the dim light of a kerosene lamp.

One day, a kind-hearted doctor visited Maya's village to provide medical care to the residents. Maya was fascinated by the doctor's work and approached her, expressing her desire to become a doctor one day. The doctor was impressed by Maya's determination and offered to mentor her.

With the doctor's guidance and support, Maya was able to secure a scholarship to attend medical school. She worked tirelessly, overcoming numerous obstacles and challenges along the way. After years of hard work and dedication, Maya finally graduated as a doctor.

Maya returned to her village as a qualified doctor and set up a clinic to provide healthcare to the community. She treated patients with compassion and care, never turning anyone away, regardless of their ability to pay. Maya's dedication and selflessness inspired others in the village to pursue their dreams and never give up, no matter how difficult the circumstances.

Maya's inspirational story spread far and wide, touching the hearts of people around the world. She became a symbol of hope and perseverance, showing that with determination and hard work, anything is possible. Maya's journey from a poor village girl to a successful doctor inspired countless others to believe in themselves and strive for a better future.
