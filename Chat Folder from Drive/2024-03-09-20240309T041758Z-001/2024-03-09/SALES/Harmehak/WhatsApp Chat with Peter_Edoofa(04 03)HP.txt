08/03/24, 11:07 am - +263 77 270 2256: Thank you
08/03/24, 11:07 am - +263 77 314 2917: I'm so pleased with this Edoofa schoolarship program l wanted you to assist us on what's to be done
08/03/24, 11:09 am - Harmehak: Dear Parent and Peter, we understand you have gone through the Brochures and Flyers of the Edoofa Program.

To emphasize  *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and has been rewarding meritorious students to lower their Fee Structure less than what you will end up paying at the Local Zimbabwe University.
08/03/24, 11:11 am - +263 77 314 2917: Ok noted
08/03/24, 11:12 am - Harmehak: Okay so Peter, as we start discussing your results further, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 


Qualification to the ESAT Exam (Please note EDOOFA calculates your results based on the TOP performers' Score so it is the percentile that we will be evaluating on)
A Level and Previous Results 
*Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 
*Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling.
Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these Four  significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
08/03/24, 11:16 am - +263 71 884 0645: Ok thank you, i think i have the qualifications to meet the desired standards

08/03/24, 1:00 pm - +263 77 270 2256: Thank you very much what a guide.
08/03/24, 1:03 pm - Harmehak: That's a wonderful course that you have settled for, Peter!

I also have access to the Feedback form that you filled out after the session with your parents and I hope you are aware, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
08/03/24, 1:03 pm - Harmehak: However as per my experience, I can share with you that *if you are able to perform and clear all these criteria with a high passing grade, you would be eligible for higher quantum of Scholarship*, in which you will just have to pay a minimal fee of *$1200-$1800*, Which would cover your entire fees be it food, accommodation, Tuition.
08/03/24, 1:05 pm - +263 71 884 0645: Thank you with the information you provided above it is helpful and it is motivating me to pursue to continue my studies in acquiring a masters degree, the MBA which can open more opportunities and i also like the learning process mentioned above which involves presentations, quizzes and practical its so fascinating thank you with your guidance Ms Harmehak
08/03/24, 1:05 pm - Harmehak: You're very welcome, Peter!
08/03/24, 1:11 pm - +263 77 314 2917: Ok noted
08/03/24, 1:11 pm - +263 71 884 0645: Ok noted
08/03/24, 1:11 pm - +263 77 270 2256: Ok noted we can try  our level best but as i have alluded prior into this is that zimbabwe we are experiencing  our hardest at the moment.
08/03/24, 1:13 pm - Harmehak: I do understand please.

The details regarding the costs have been discussed with Peter already before he applied please.

However, currently he is being offered a higher quantum of scholarship where $1200-1800 includes his tuition fee, accomodation, food and basic university expenses.
08/03/24, 1:16 pm - +263 77 270 2256: Ok noted  no problem
08/03/24, 1:16 pm - +263 77 314 2917: I understand, It's a  reasonable amount thank you
08/03/24, 1:18 pm - Harmehak: Did you inform your parents about the same earlier too, Peter?
08/03/24, 1:19 pm - +263 71 884 0645: Yes i did
08/03/24, 1:20 pm - Harmehak: I am glad to know that.
08/03/24, 1:20 pm - Harmehak: Peter, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,

While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time. 

This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year. 

Wouldn't you agree to the same?
08/03/24, 1:21 pm - +263 77 314 2917: I agree with you
08/03/24, 1:21 pm - +263 77 270 2256: Thats true
08/03/24, 1:22 pm - Harmehak: Indeed!
08/03/24, 1:23 pm - +263 77 270 2256: I agee with you.
08/03/24, 1:23 pm - +263 77 314 2917: Thank you
08/03/24, 1:24 pm - Harmehak: I believe now comparing the same with costs in Zimbabwe you must be in a better position to relate how Edoofa is making higher education affordable and accessible for international students in India, isn't it?

Along with an opportunity like the Earn While You Learn Program.
08/03/24, 1:29 pm - +263 77 270 2256: Yes  you offer affordable higher international studies .
08/03/24, 1:31 pm - +263 77 314 2917: Yes it is
08/03/24, 1:33 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate please!
08/03/24, 1:34 pm - Harmehak: Great!

So what all do you remember regarding the Earn While You Learn Program, Peter?
08/03/24, 1:43 pm - +263 71 884 0645: This message was deleted
08/03/24, 1:44 pm - +263 71 884 0645: I remember that in addition of experiencing high quality education a student is also able to earn money whilst studying, the apprenticeship help a student to raise money for extra use
08/03/24, 1:45 pm - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
08/03/24, 1:47 pm - +263 71 884 0645: Ok thank you now i have better understanding
08/03/24, 1:48 pm - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
08/03/24, 1:48 pm - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $1800 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$600 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $50-$60 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
08/03/24, 1:54 pm - +263 71 884 0645: I now know the importance of EWYL program and it is much helpful especially in lowering the annual school fees which is a great thing
08/03/24, 1:56 pm - Harmehak: I am glad to know that, Peter!
08/03/24, 1:56 pm - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

08/03/24, 2:00 pm - Harmehak: This message was deleted
08/03/24, 2:01 pm - +263 71 884 0645: Wow so much students participating in the EWYL and the best part of the program is that there is no limitation on the student earnings, I'm highly motivated to participate in the program
08/03/24, 2:03 pm - Harmehak: Very correct, Peter!
08/03/24, 2:03 pm - Harmehak: Peter, I hope it was quite evident during the Videos played during the presentations that you attended the students working on the Internships and Attachments of the much coveted Earn While You Learn Program manage to earn USD 50- USD 100 Each however since there is no limit to earning students like Persistence Muza were able to also self finance the Cost of Education though students like these are less but I am sure you are highly motivated!
08/03/24, 2:09 pm - +263 71 884 0645: Everything was crystal clear and I'm also having this inner push in myself to be able to reach earnings like other students are earning
08/03/24, 2:11 pm - Harmehak: I am delighted to know that, Peter!

I hope you also remember Dr. Gupta discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members were available even if they were not you discussed the same with them so will they be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
08/03/24, 2:16 pm - +263 71 884 0645: Yes my parents are the ones going to be supporting me for my higher education
08/03/24, 2:18 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate their support, Peter!
08/03/24, 2:19 pm - Harmehak: Dr. Gupta also shared about the Enrollment Fee of USD 350 that EDOOFA charges up front, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students. However, for that, you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
08/03/24, 2:21 pm - +263 71 884 0645: Yes im aware of the fee and you can assist me in understanding in how to make the application fee affordable
08/03/24, 2:21 pm - Harmehak: Alright, Peter!
08/03/24, 2:21 pm - Harmehak: So for an Edoofian the Enrollment Fee would include:

*1. Guaranteed Scholarship*
*2. Application fee of all the Edoofa’s Associated Universities*
*3. Cost of Multiple Statement of Purposes drafted*
*4. Recommendation Letter drafted for the Student*
*5. Earn While You Learn Program’s Training*
*6. Visa Assistance*
*7. SLICE CON*
*8. Department of Student Welfare*
*9. Attachments and Internship Opportunities*
08/03/24, 2:26 pm - +263 71 884 0645: OK i understand
08/03/24, 2:27 pm - Harmehak: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
08/03/24, 2:27 pm - Harmehak: You see Edoofa's exceptional program has opened up a world of opportunities for aspiring students, garnering thousands of applications on a daily basis. The Eligibility Evaluation process ensures that deserving candidates are granted the chance to participate in the program. *Once accepted, students are requested to pay a nominal Program Fee of $350 within 7 days of receiving their acceptance letter*, following which they commence with their admission process and the esteemed Earn While You Learn Program. Edoofa's mission to provide quality education and support to students is at the heart of this initiative, and we are honored to make a difference in the lives of deserving individuals through this program.
08/03/24, 2:28 pm - Harmehak: *Considering your results of ESAT we also offer an additional waiver of USD 50 in your Enrollment Fee upon your consideration in the Slice Con 24 Committee Fund.*

Out of a Total of 3000 students only 200 have been given this opportunity, as a counselor I feel it's a great privilege that has been offered to you.
08/03/24, 2:29 pm - +263 77 270 2256: We are here to support  him thank you so much  Ms . Harmehak
08/03/24, 2:30 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate your acknowledgement please!
08/03/24, 2:36 pm - +263 71 884 0645: Its a great opportunity indeed, i understand
08/03/24, 2:38 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate!
08/03/24, 2:38 pm - Harmehak: However Peter, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $100 within the next 30 days.*
08/03/24, 2:42 pm - +263 77 314 2917: Thank you for the payment plan
08/03/24, 2:42 pm - Harmehak: You're very welcome!
08/03/24, 2:42 pm - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
08/03/24, 2:42 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
08/03/24, 2:42 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in their country itself.
08/03/24, 2:42 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
08/03/24, 2:51 pm - +263 71 884 0645: I understand the cycle from step 1 to 5
08/03/24, 2:52 pm - Harmehak: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
08/03/24, 2:52 pm - Harmehak: Basically, this registration fee ($500-$1000) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024-2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
08/03/24, 2:52 pm - Harmehak: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*

Here is a picture of the Visa of one of the Edoofian who arrived in India, for 2023 Academic Intake.
08/03/24, 2:52 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
08/03/24, 2:54 pm - +263 77 270 2256: Thank you, that is managable we can afford  to do that.
08/03/24, 2:55 pm - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
08/03/24, 2:55 pm - Harmehak: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)
08/03/24, 2:55 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>

08/03/24, 3:01 pm - Harmehak: Wonderful!
08/03/24, 3:01 pm - Harmehak: Your parents can connect with Mrs Ruth as well.
08/03/24, 3:02 pm - +263 77 314 2917: Ok let me connect with her
08/03/24, 3:03 pm - +263 77 270 2256: Yes we will connect to her  thank you.
08/03/24, 3:04 pm - Harmehak: Great!

So far, what all would you like to ask please?
08/03/24, 3:24 pm - +263 71 884 0645: I think everything is clear i  understand
08/03/24, 3:27 pm - Harmehak: Alright please!
08/03/24, 3:28 pm - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
08/03/24, 3:28 pm - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
