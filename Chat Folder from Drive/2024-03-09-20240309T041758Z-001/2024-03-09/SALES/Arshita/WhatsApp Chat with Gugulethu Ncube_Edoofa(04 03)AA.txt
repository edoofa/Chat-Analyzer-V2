This ensures that they can follow the sessions, comprehend the program thoroughly, and pose any questions they may have. Given that higher education is a significant decision requiring family support. If they are currently unavailable, they can still join the group and catch up on the conversations later.
*So, I am making you the group admin, please add your parents/guardians or educational supporters and let me know the names and the relations once done.*

08/03/24, 3:05 pm - Arshita: Noted
08/03/24, 3:05 pm - Arshita: Let me brief you that, I want to brief you that the criteria before the pandemic was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is *a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.
08/03/24, 3:09 pm - +263 78 912 7961: Im totally confident about achieving it
08/03/24, 3:09 pm - Arshita: Good to know that!
08/03/24, 3:09 pm - Arshita: As your evaluation progress, I would like to appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country. In this process did you make any prior research on foreign education or applied to any University abroad?
08/03/24, 3:12 pm - +263 78 912 7961: Yes I did apply to the Jain Deemed to be a university scholarship program then the other scholarships I came across didn't offer the medicine courses that's why I didn't opt for them
08/03/24, 8:02 pm - Arshita: Let's plan to reconnect tomorrow to continue our discussion at Let us connect at *10:30 am CAT Tomorrow* to resume your session 

*In case the student is having lessons, the parents can also take part in the session*

Stay Blessed!
