*"If you can dream it, you can do it."*

On this positive note, shall we begin with your session?

05/03/24, 10:33 am - Arshita: Dear Parent and Student, we understand you have gone through the Brochures and Flyers of the Edoofa Program.
To emphasize  *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and has been rewarding meritorious students to lower their Fee Structure less than what you will end up paying at the Local Zimbabwe University
05/03/24, 10:34 am - Arshita: Okay so Ropafadzo, as we start discussing your results further, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 


Qualification to the ESAT Exam (Please note EDOOFA calculates your results based on the TOP performers' Score so it is the percentile that we will be evaluating on)
A Level and Previous Results 
*Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 
*Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these Four  significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
05/03/24, 11:19 am - +263 71 699 3082: Well noted ma'am and I am ready to start ahead

05/03/24, 2:12 pm - +263 71 699 3082: Yes I picked up that I could actually PERSUE  Human Resources after I get through with the BBA
05/03/24, 2:14 pm - Arshita: That's a wonderful course that you have settled for, I also have access to the Feedback form that you filled out after the session with your parents and I hope you are aware, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*

05/03/24, 2:16 pm - +263 71 699 3082: Yes ma'am l am  well aware of that
05/03/24, 2:18 pm - Arshita: In simple words Ropafadzo what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
05/03/24, 2:20 pm - +263 71 699 3082: It's actually a good program ma'am
05/03/24, 2:21 pm - Arshita: However as per my experience, since you have a valid ESAT Score with decent High School Results, as per your interaction with the Board of Directors at Edoofa you surely will be rewarded with higher quantum of scholarship after which the average annual fee for you could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, now this , and even *After this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
05/03/24, 2:22 pm - +263 71 699 3082: All in the ears ma'am

05/03/24, 2:28 pm - +263 71 699 3082: That's wonderful thank you
05/03/24, 2:29 pm - +263 71 699 3082: Very motivated ma'am , he has given us a burning desire to follow his footsteps
05/03/24, 2:31 pm - Arshita: Alright Ropafadzo, I hope you also remember Dr. Gupta discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members were available even if they were not you discussed the same with them so will they be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
05/03/24, 2:32 pm - +263 71 699 3082: Yes ma'am I explained everything to them and also showed them the recorded videos, they are the ones who will be supporting me

05/03/24, 2:38 pm - Arshita: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
05/03/24, 2:39 pm - +263 71 699 3082: That is okay with me
05/03/24, 2:39 pm - Arshita: You see Edoofa's exceptional program has opened up a world of opportunities for aspiring students, garnering thousands of applications on a daily basis. The Eligibility Evaluation process ensures that deserving candidates are granted the chance to participate in the program. *Once accepted, students are requested to pay a nominal Program Fee of $350 within 7 days of receiving their acceptance letter*, following which they commence with their admission process and the esteemed Earn While You Learn Program. Edoofa's mission to provide quality education and support to students is at the heart of this initiative, and we are honored to make a difference in the lives of deserving individuals through this program.
05/03/24, 2:40 pm - Arshita: Considering your results of ESAT we also offer an additional waiver of *USD 50* in your Enrollment Fee upon your consideration in the Slice Con 24 Committee Fund. 

Out of a Total of 3000 students only 200 have been given this opportunity, as a counselor I feel it's a great privilege that has been offered to you.
05/03/24, 2:42 pm - +263 71 699 3082: Well understand ma'am 
So on the additional part l should pay $400 in total or?
05/03/24, 2:42 pm - Arshita: No, $300
05/03/24, 2:43 pm - Arshita: However Ropafadzo, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $100 within the next 30 days.*
05/03/24, 2:44 pm - +263 71 699 3082: Oooh okey I understand now
So l am supposed to pay $300 after the acceptance letter
05/03/24, 2:44 pm - +263 71 699 3082: Well that is very much flexible
05/03/24, 2:46 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
05/03/24, 2:48 pm - +263 71 699 3082: Following ma'am

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zimbabwe itself.
05/03/24, 2:50 pm - Arshita: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
05/03/24, 2:51 pm - +263 71 699 3082: Yes ma'am well understood
05/03/24, 2:55 pm - Arshita: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of the registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.

06/03/24, 10:04 am - Arshita: Being a parent, the concern regarding the welfare and personal development of your child is absolutely understandable. 

To give a glimpse, we have a community of more than 2500 Zimbabweans with  300+ associate schools from Zimbabwe with a panel of Headmasters, teachers, and parents, who have been bringing success stories of Edoofians for the past 14+ years due to the kind of foster and care that we provide throughout their course!

With UGC-approved Universities whose degrees are Globally accredited, and which have all security and healthcare facilities including counselling departments, Edoofians are exposed to a conducive environment that motivates them to focus on their career and achieve their dreams. There are Zimbabwean Communities at Every University so no child will feel lonely. Moreover, our Admission Team, EWYL(Earn While You Learn) mentor and counsellor of a student will be available to him/her throughout the course. At any point, if the student or parent needs assistance we will be readily accessible. This is the reason why Edoofa is known as a *Higher Education Concierge!*

The Universities are strict in terms of the welfare of children. Being in Zimbabwe itself, your parents will be able to track the happenings, academic performance, and University details
