*"The secret of getting ahead is getting started." - Mark Twain*

On a positive note, I am here to begin our session
Are you ready?

04/03/24, 10:37 am - Arshita: Okay so Sasha, as we start discussing your results further, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 


Qualification to the ESAT Exam (Please note EDOOFA calculates your results based on the TOP performers' Score so it is the percentile that we will be evaluating on)
A Level and Previous Results 
*Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 
*Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these Four  significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
04/03/24, 11:08 am - +263 77 300 3622: Noted
04/03/24, 11:10 am - Arshita: Alright so Sasha, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.

Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work) since I honestly don't know a lot about you?*
04/03/24, 11:14 am - +263 78 562 7449: Okay

05/03/24, 10:46 am - Arshita: MBA, or Master of Business Administration, is a graduate-level degree program that focuses on the study of management and business principles. It is designed to equip students with the skills and knowledge necessary to excel in various areas of business, such as finance, marketing, human resources, operations, and strategic management.

Typically, an MBA program covers a wide range of topics including accounting, economics, entrepreneurship, leadership, organizational behavior, and business ethics. These programs often incorporate case studies, group projects, internships, and other practical experiences to provide students with real-world exposure and opportunities to apply theoretical concepts in practical settings.

The duration of an MBA program can vary, but it usually takes one to two years to complete full-time, although part-time and online options are also available for those who wish to continue working while pursuing their degree.

Upon completion of an MBA, graduates often pursue careers in various fields such as consulting, finance, marketing, healthcare, technology, and entrepreneurship. The degree is highly regarded by employers and can significantly enhance career prospects, salary potential, and opportunities for advancement in the business world.
05/03/24, 10:49 am - +263 78 562 7449: That's interesting👏🏻👏🏻thank you

05/03/24, 10:51 am - +263 78 562 7449: What differentiate 1 year and 2 year course
05/03/24, 10:52 am - +263 78 562 7449: 1 would love a 1 year
05/03/24, 10:54 am - Arshita: 1 year is not considered as degree
05/03/24, 10:55 am - +263 78 562 7449: Okay
05/03/24, 10:56 am - Arshita: Did you understand the course?
05/03/24, 10:56 am - +263 78 562 7449: Yes
05/03/24, 10:57 am - Arshita: That's a wonderful course that you have settled for, I also have access to the Feedback form that you filled out after the session with your parents and I hope you are aware, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
05/03/24, 11:02 am - Arshita: In simple words Sasha what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
05/03/24, 11:04 am - +263 78 562 7449: Mmm I dont think my mom can afford that kind of money ...she is struggling and she have struggled all along for this degree that I'm about to finish..for me to start another 2 yr course which needs 6000 it will be very very difficult ...things are getting worse day by day this side ..and I was about to defer this year because of school fees
05/03/24, 11:06 am - +263 78 562 7449: It will be better than way
05/03/24, 11:07 am - +263 78 562 7449: *that
05/03/24, 11:09 am - Arshita: Are you comfortable with the cost of education?
05/03/24, 11:12 am - +263 78 562 7449: Yes with Earn while you learn yes because I will not expect my mother to send me any money rather I should be the one sending trying to make life easier for her and upgrading myself as well
05/03/24, 11:13 am - Arshita: I hope it was quite evident during the Videos played during the presentations that you attended the students working on the Internships and Attachments of the much coveted EArn While You Learn Program manage to earn USD 50- USD 100 Each however since there is no limit to earning students like Persistence Muza were able to also self finance the Cost of Education though students like these are less but I am sure you are highly motivated!
05/03/24, 11:16 am - +263 78 562 7449: Sure ..the Bills are all on me so I will try to the fullest
05/03/24, 11:17 am - +263 78 562 7449: How about the the ticket and the Visa
05/03/24, 11:18 am - Arshita: Ticket will be managed by you. <This message was edited>
05/03/24, 11:20 am - +263 78 562 7449: How much is it
05/03/24, 11:21 am - Arshita: If you understand the concept of International Education, the finances that play a major role is not visa fee or flight ticket because visa fee is given once in the whole program and the flight ticket is taken a limited number of times,maybe twice or once,because international students don't often travel back to their country.

They look forward to settling down and making sure education is not hampered.So they learn and do internships at breaks.But still students can definitely visit their family during holidays and spend time with them.

But I personally have seen that students don't travel often,so considering these the traveling fee
*(air fare :-around $400,Visa fee:-$83) is to be borne by the student* which is mostly a one time investment.
05/03/24, 11:23 am - +263 78 562 7449: That is very affordable
05/03/24, 11:24 am - Arshita: Alright Sasha, I hope you also remember Dr. Gupta discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members were available even if they were not you discussed the same with them so will they be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
05/03/24, 11:28 am - +263 78 562 7449: I left the venue earlier to travel back home on time I did not get the information in depth
05/03/24, 11:30 am - Arshita: <Media omitted>
05/03/24, 11:33 am - +263 78 562 7449: I'm ready
05/03/24, 11:36 am - Arshita: So for an Edoofian the Enrollment Fee would include:

*1. Guaranteed Scholarship*
*2. Application fee of all the Edoofa’s Associated Universities*
*3. Cost of Multiple Statement of Purposes drafted*
*4. Recommendation Letter drafted for the Student*
*5. Earn While You Learn Program’s Training*
*6. Visa Assistance*
*7. SLICE CON*
*8. Department of Student Welfare*
*9. Attachments and Internship Opportunities*
05/03/24, 11:37 am - +263 78 562 7449: Ok
05/03/24, 11:37 am - Arshita: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
05/03/24, 11:44 am - +263 78 562 7449: Following
05/03/24, 11:45 am - Arshita: You see Edoofa's exceptional program has opened up a world of opportunities for aspiring students, garnering thousands of applications on a daily basis. The Eligibility Evaluation process ensures that deserving candidates are granted the chance to participate in the program. *Once accepted, students are requested to pay a nominal Program Fee of $350 within 7 days of receiving their acceptance letter*, following which they commence with their admission process and the esteemed Earn While You Learn Program. Edoofa's mission to provide quality education and support to students is at the heart of this initiative, and we are honored to make a difference in the lives of deserving individuals through this program.
05/03/24, 11:45 am - Arshita: Considering your results of ESAT we also offer an additional waiver of *USD 50* in your Enrollment Fee upon your consideration in the Slice Con 24 Committee Fund. 

Out of a Total of 3000 students only 200 have been given this opportunity, as a counselor I feel it's a great privilege that has been offered to you.
05/03/24, 11:47 am - +263 78 562 7449: Noted
05/03/24, 11:49 am - Arshita: Now, let me brief you how the process follows after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.

Are you familiar with the Edoofa Cycle?
05/03/24, 11:49 am - +263 78 562 7449: Nice thank you ..which means I will $300 instead of 350?
05/03/24, 11:49 am - Arshita: Absolutely
05/03/24, 11:49 am - +263 78 562 7449: Nop
05/03/24, 11:50 am - +263 78 562 7449: Ok
05/03/24, 11:50 am - Arshita: <Media omitted>

05/03/24, 11:55 am - +263 78 562 7449: Proceed
05/03/24, 11:55 am - Arshita: Alright Sasha, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zimbabwe itself.
05/03/24, 11:56 am - Arshita: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
05/03/24, 11:58 am - +263 78 562 7449: Yes I do
05/03/24, 11:58 am - Arshita: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of the registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
05/03/24, 11:58 am - Arshita: Basically, this registration fee will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August/September 2024 and the remaining in January next year 2025.
05/03/24, 11:58 am - Arshita: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*

05/03/24, 12:05 pm - +263 78 562 7449: Ok
06/03/24, 8:07 am - Arshita: We have come to the end of your counselling session. Before I guide you Step 2 of the Eligibility Check, I want you to have a full-fledged discussion of the Edoofa program within your family as higher education is supposed to be a family decision. Ensure to include these aspects during the discussions:-
