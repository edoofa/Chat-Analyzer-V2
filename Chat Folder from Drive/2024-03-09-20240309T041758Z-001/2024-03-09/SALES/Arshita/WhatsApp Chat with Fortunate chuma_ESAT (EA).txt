07/03/24, 10:38 am - Arshita: Dear Parent and Student, we understand you have gone through the Brochures and Flyers of the Edoofa Program.
To emphasize  *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and has been rewarding meritorious students to lower their Fee Structure less than what you will end up paying at the Local Zimbabwe University
07/03/24, 10:38 am - Arshita: Okay so Fortunate, as we start discussing your results further, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 


Qualification to the ESAT Exam (Please note EDOOFA calculates your results based on the TOP performers' Score so it is the percentile that we will be evaluating on)
A Level and Previous Results 
*Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 
*Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these Four  significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
07/03/24, 6:13 pm - +263 77 626 6269: Hie
07/03/24, 7:58 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
08/03/24, 4:28 am - +263 71 784 9663: Yes l think l have what it takes to meet those four matrics and get higher quantum of scholarship
08/03/24, 9:34 am - Arshita: Greetings!

*Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world.*

On this positive note, shall we begin with your session?
08/03/24, 9:37 am - +263 77 626 6269: Good morning
08/03/24, 9:37 am - +263 77 626 6269: Firstly l would like to express my gratitude for affording my child a golden opportunity to study on a scholarship in India
08/03/24, 9:38 am - +263 77 626 6269: While she is attending lessons, we may proceed with the conselling if it is ok with you
08/03/24, 10:04 am - Arshita: That is well noted
08/03/24, 10:06 am - Arshita: Alright , now to help Fortunate in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with her introduction.

I would like to know her better as a student, so please go ahead, and tell me a bit about her, her education, what her wish to study, her strengths, her weaknesses, her hobbies, and a detailed description of her family background, *Where do her parents work (Place) in the country or any other country that they have relocated to due to work promises?  Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work) since I honestly don't know a lot about her?*
08/03/24, 11:33 am - +263 77 626 6269: Well, currently Fortunate Chuma is doing her A level, lower 6, at Martin Luther. She grabbed the opportunity to register with the Edoofa family when the opportunity knocked. 

Fortunate Chuma wrote her Ordinary level last year and passed 7 subjects. She is naturally bended towards Arts subject as is shown by her O level results. Besides, she is intrinsically motivated towards Arts subjects as she enjoys the study area, which she happens to be doing at A level. She is passionate about being a lawyer one day and any material and guidance towards this effect is essential.

Born in Nyanga in 2005, Fortunate was not treated by the best of circumstances. Her parents separated when she was still an infant. It is her hardwork and resilience that has brought her this far.

Interestingly she came to Harare to stay with her brother in 2020. Her brother immediately took her guardianship to this day and with the help of her mother, he has made sure that she attends school.

I happen to be the brother. I work as a teacher here in Harare.

So generally that is the summary of her life
08/03/24, 11:38 am - Arshita: Good to know more about her! 

I want to inform you that her intake is yet not opened. You can contact me once she is in U6
08/03/24, 11:41 am - +263 77 626 6269: Ok, so does that mean she forfeit her chance and will have to go through the interviews again or you will consider her for what she has done already?
08/03/24, 11:42 am - Arshita: The process will begin from where we have left <This message was edited>
08/03/24, 11:43 am - +263 77 626 6269: Ok thank you. How will we know when her intake in open
08/03/24, 11:45 am - Arshita: Once she is in U6 you can contact me
08/03/24, 11:46 am - +263 77 626 6269: Ok thank you.
