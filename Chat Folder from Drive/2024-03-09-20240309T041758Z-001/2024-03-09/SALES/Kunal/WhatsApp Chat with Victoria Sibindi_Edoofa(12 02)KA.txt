Shall we proceed?
07/03/24, 9:13 am - Kunal: Greetings to you

I was waiting for you to share your concerns with me but unfortunately, I didn’t hear from you and therefore I was asked to put your application on hold, but before doing the same, I was going through the form you submitted, I noticed that you come from a family background wherein you plan to pursue your higher education abroad and was looking for a scholarship. I am looking forward to hearing from you so that I can make your dream of higher education abroad come true through an affordable, accessible, and employment-oriented higher education program.

Please Note by *Tomorrow*, I would have to submit my final response regarding your application, so failure to get back to me would mean cancellation of your application after which you would have to re-apply
07/03/24, 9:59 pm - +263 78 716 6562: I really need this scholarship so that I can not be dependable on anyone from my family and I really want to study abroad if possible because of the diverse areas of education so the reason why I  wasnt able to respond was that most of the times I'll be awat from my phone and in the library studying kindle accept my apology and application
