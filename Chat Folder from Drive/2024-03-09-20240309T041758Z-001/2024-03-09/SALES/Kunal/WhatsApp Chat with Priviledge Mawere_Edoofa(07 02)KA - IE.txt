09/02/24, 10:36 am - +263 71 977 4569: Yeah i can't wait
09/02/24, 10:46 am - Kunal: Good to hear that, now to help you become a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction. Please go ahead, and tell me about yourself: your strengths, your weaknesses, your hobbies, and a detailed description of your family background. Also do share the following details:

*1. Your current educational level (O Level/ L5/ U6) and subject combination**
*2. The course you would like to study and your area of interest in higher education?*
*3. What do your parents do (their profession)?*
*4. What is your parent’s highest education level?*
*5. Do you have any siblings? if yes, what do they do?*
*6. Who has been financially supporting you for your Education so far?*
*7. Who will be financially supporting your higher education abroad?*
 *8. Which province in Zimbabwe are you from?*
*9. What is the name of your O-level and A-level school and how much was your per-term fee in school in USD($)?*
09/02/24, 12:04 pm - +263 71 977 4569: In terms of my strengths, I pride myself on being a highly organized and detail-oriented individual. I have a knack for problem-solving and enjoy taking on challenges that require analytical thinking. Additionally, I am a good communicator and have the ability to collaborate effectively with others, which helps foster positive relationships and teamwork.

However, like everyone, I also have my weaknesses. One area I'm constantly working on is time management. Sometimes I find myself getting immersed in tasks and losing track of time. I'm actively striving to improve my ability to prioritize and manage my schedule more efficiently. I believe self-awareness is key to personal growth, and I'm committed to addressing and overcoming my weaknesses.

Outside of my professional life, I have a variety of hobbies that bring me joy and help me unwind. I find solace in music and enjoy listening to different genres. Another hobby I indulge in is reading. I love getting lost in the world of books and expanding my knowledge across various subjects. It's a great way for me to relax and stimulate my mind.

When it comes to my family background, I come from a close-knit and supportive family. I was born and raised in [Kwekwe/Zimbabwe], where I have fond memories of my childhood. My mother have always emphasized the importance of education and have been my pillars of support throughout my life. I have a sibling with whom I share a strong bond, and we've always encouraged and motivated each other to pursue our dreams. The values of love, respect, and perseverance were instilled in me from an early age, and they continue to shape my character and guide my actions.

That's a brief glimpse into who I am and what matters to me. I look forward to getting to know you better and exploring new experiences together."
