19/01/24, 9:30 am - +265 991 59 81 60: Good morning
Edoofa has played an important role to reduce the cost to $2000 -$3000. The comfort comes in because of the Earn while you learn program. Looking at Joseph's strong passion for  Education in addition to his hard working spirit and good behavior ,as a family we are prepared to do everything possible to offer him support both financial and moral for him to achieve his goal.
Having said that I am personally committed to do what is humanly possible within my limit as a parent as Edoofa has already demonstrated the compassionate and supportive role by substantial cost reduction.
19/01/24, 9:41 am - +265 991 59 81 60: We have discussed this issue as a family, we are all committed and determined. Joseph is determined and ready to seize this opportunity, he understands our financial position he promises to work very hard excited with the Earn while you learn program as a window of opportunity to over come the financial stumbling block to his much needed Education career
19/01/24, 9:57 am - Kunal: Good morning to you all
How are you doing?
19/01/24, 9:59 am - +265 991 59 81 60: We are fine thank you and how are you?
19/01/24, 10:09 am - Kunal: I am doing fine, thank you
19/01/24, 10:10 am - Kunal: I see you have well understood everything
So, may I know if you are comfortable with every aspect to proceed ahead?
19/01/24, 10:14 am - +265 991 59 81 60: We may proceed thank you.
19/01/24, 10:36 am - Kunal: Alright please
I have also noted that Joseph is well motivated towards this career path in Medicine and looking forward to excelling in it

What motivated him towards this career goal?
19/01/24, 11:39 am - +265 991 59 81 60: I have been discussing with Joseph on why he has a strong passion to study medicine. The first response was his compassion for the sick struggling to raise money for special medical attention .This motivated Joseph to love sciences and mathematics and made him study hard to pass with distinctions. He understands fully the need to do well in sciences for him to be a surgeon. And that helping sick people indefatigably   requires hard working spirit and a compassionate heart.
19/01/24, 11:51 am - +265 991 59 81 60: I can testify as a parent that to study medicine is not an impulse decision to Joseph but part of his long term plan. All his academic studies is meant to achieve this goal of becoming a surgeon  help the sick in need of specialized attention.
19/01/24, 12:03 pm - Kunal: It's truly inspiring to learn about Joseph's strong passion for studying medicine. His initial motivation, driven by compassion for those struggling to afford special medical attention, speaks volumes about his empathy and dedication
It's evident that Joseph's motivation goes beyond personal success, focusing on making a positive impact on the lives of others.

Cardiovascular Technology, the second option would physiotherapy. 
What could the difference in terms of affordability between cardiovascular Technology and physiotherapy
23/01/24, 2:48 pm - +265 991 59 81 60: What is the quantum of scholarship for cardiovascular Technology compared to Physiotherapy
23/01/24, 3:00 pm - Kunal: The final percentage of the scholarship will be decided after the University Sessions of an Edoofian after his/her enrollment

The percentage of scholarships is determined by the following factors

1) Academic Excellence
2) Merit
3) Previous Experiences
4) Recommendations from Edoofa
5) Statement of Purpose(SOP) 
6) Extracurricular Activities

So the universities will evaluate them to decide the final quantum of the scholarship
However, as per my experience, courses like Bachelor of Science in Medical Lab Technology and Bachelor of Physiotherapy offers Higher quantum of scholarship which makes the education more affordable

23/01/24, 3:21 pm - +265 991 59 81 60: Thank you
23/01/24, 3:23 pm - Kunal: So, can you now tell me? 

How would studying in India implement a positive impact on your child’s career?
23/01/24, 3:53 pm - +265 991 59 81 60: Access to affordable and higher quality Education in India will give him an opportunity  and position him in a level of high world class performers full of much needed skills and knowledge employable world wide.
23/01/24, 3:54 pm - +265 991 59 81 60: On quality Education can make him have an impact
23/01/24, 3:56 pm - Kunal: Indeed, I believe your child would learn a lot from the exposures offered if found eligible and works hard to achieve the dreams. Moving ahead, by any chance are you familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?
23/01/24, 3:59 pm - +265 991 59 81 60: I only remember the cost of $6000 to$8000 without Edoofa scholarship
23/01/24, 3:59 pm - +265 991 59 81 60: It could be more
23/01/24, 3:59 pm - Kunal: Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth! 

In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc,it is still beyond the reach of many.
With the Edoofa Scholarship Program,the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library,Wifi,Laundry,etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
23/01/24, 4:00 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
23/01/24, 4:00 pm - Kunal: In simple words what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost $3000 or less a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well. 

However, as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even after this we allow the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.

*So do you feel the reduced cost of education is affordable to your family?*
23/01/24, 4:13 pm - +265 991 59 81 60: With the Earn While you Learn Program in place I would say yes.
23/01/24, 4:16 pm - Kunal: Good to hear that
23/01/24, 4:17 pm - Kunal: Let me tell you how Edoofa helps Edoofians bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the *Earn While You Learn Program*

The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that are equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable. The Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies and needs, converting an Individual into a market-ready professional. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
23/01/24, 4:17 pm - Kunal: *Projects with Brands and Companies: -*
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, such as:
*Africa Global Radio-* The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project and hear from the CEO about the exposures of the Edoofa program.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4DAP24ZuY4&authuser=0
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0
*Skooqs-* This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

*Recruitment Partners:-*
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

*Webinars:-*
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars regularly with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
-Digitalization of Industries: How to Become an all-rounder in the Ever-changing Professional World by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
-How to Network like a Boss by Ms Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi

23/01/24, 4:17 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
23/01/24, 4:19 pm - +265 991 59 81 60: I know his sister is starting year one on 12 February,2024 at Kamuzu university of Health sciences
23/01/24, 4:19 pm - +265 991 59 81 60: The Earn While you Learn will indeed help for us as a family to afford
23/01/24, 4:22 pm - +265 991 59 81 60: Very much so, this program is unique and very helpful
23/01/24, 4:25 pm - +265 991 59 81 60: I Joseph very well as hard working as he is he cannot hesitate to take advantage of this golden opportunity and kind consideration
23/01/24, 4:26 pm - +265 991 59 81 60: We as parents we are also ready to support financially
23/01/24, 4:28 pm - Kunal: Indeed,
If I have to help you explain how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable compared to Local Universities, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now, if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, bringing the cost further down to $1000 per year including the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month. _This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly._

*You can see this even in this scholarship credit certificate where one of our star performers, our Proud Edoodians  Masinire Miriam earned $1965 within a year.* I hope you can now realize the power of the EWYL program to reduce the financial pressure on families?
23/01/24, 4:29 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
23/01/24, 4:35 pm - +265 991 59 81 60: This is not only inspiring but also gives hope of achieving career goals in the midst of financial bottlenecks
23/01/24, 4:36 pm - +265 991 59 81 60: Very unique program
23/01/24, 4:38 pm - Kunal: Great, Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, a few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :

*1. Expert Career Counselling:* We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counsellors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.

*2. Affordability through guaranteed scholarships:* Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off.

*3. Earn While You Learn:* The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing our students for the real world. 

*4.Higher Education Concierge:* A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.*

After going through these facts that make Edoofa different, which one out of the 4 did you feel is the most significant?
23/01/24, 4:42 pm - Kunal: Let us connect at *9:30 am CAT Tomorrow to resume your session *(In case you have any challenges, please let me know the time you will be available, and we will schedule accordingly)*

24/01/24, 12:14 pm - +265 991 59 81 60: We have no  sponsor, as a family we shall be responsible for the remaining fees
24/01/24, 12:19 pm - +265 991 59 81 60: We are optimistic to do everything possible to support him cover the remaining fees as the biggest part is already covered by Edoofa
24/01/24, 12:30 pm - Kunal: Please excuse me for some time as I am heading for my lunch. Let us connect at 2:00 pm CAT for the next part of our session. Let me know if you have any challenges with the schedule. 

Meanwhile, you can go through our Social Media pages to learn more about the experiences of Edoofians and the program!

24/01/24, 1:36 pm - Kunal: Greetings everyone
Shall we proceed?
24/01/24, 1:42 pm - +265 991 59 81 60: Good afternoon
Please proceed
24/01/24, 1:52 pm - Kunal: I believe you'll be discussing everything with your family after we complete today's session. Also, after our counselling session, I would connect to some of our beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know their experiences and proceedings well.

May I know how you feel about your child studying abroad?
24/01/24, 2:06 pm - +265 991 59 81 60: I feel greatly honored especially to study in India in particular
24/01/24, 2:20 pm - Kunal: I am glad to hear that, studying Internationally would make your child’s career advance at an even greater pace, as your child will be transformed into a professional with a Greater Paying Job, which would help in uplifting your family and provide a hassle-free life.
24/01/24, 2:20 pm - Kunal: *As we move to the last part of the session, let me highlight a few requirements while a student applies alone* 

*1) Application Form* -An online or offline form that asks for your personal details and academic background.

*2) Statement of Purpose-* An essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and your aspirations for your career.

*3) Letter of Recommendation-* from Senior authorities, School Heads or others on why they recommend you to be a right fit for an international university.
Do you know about other requirements?
24/01/24, 2:50 pm - +265 991 59 81 60: Visa , fee payment and travel arrangements
24/01/24, 2:51 pm - +265 991 59 81 60: That's what think could also be required
24/01/24, 2:52 pm - +265 991 59 81 60: You may guild
24/01/24, 2:56 pm - Kunal: Absolutely, When a student applies alone for an international University, on average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose costs between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally and act as a major parameter to decide the child’s eligibility. If you apply to 5 Universities, the average costs for the mentioned would be $1350-$1750, *without even receiving a guarantee to be selected*

*Edoofa has identified a solution for this uncertainty and unaffordability.* If a student qualifies after the eligibility check, not only does Edoofa help them draft their statement of purpose but also helps in terms of Visa Documentation Assistance, University Session and selection, Individual mentorship, etc, reducing the costs significantly to $750 which is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
24/01/24, 2:56 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
24/01/24, 3:04 pm - +265 991 59 81 60: Yes please let me know
24/01/24, 3:09 pm - Kunal: The enrollment fee is to be paid only if a child is found eligible for the Edoofa Scholarship Program after passing the eligibility check stage, it includes, 

*Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
*Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
*Earn While You Learn Program and training*
*University sessions and selection*
*A guaranteed scholarship seat*
*Visa Documentation Assistance*
*The Foster and Care throughout the course of an Edoofian*
24/01/24, 3:09 pm - Kunal: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge due to which parents might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short period of 7 days and for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option wherein if the student is found eligible, instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, *parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days thereby reducing the financial pressure.*
24/01/24, 3:51 pm - Kunal: Shall we proceed? @265991598160
24/01/24, 4:08 pm - +265 991 59 81 60: The observation above is very true and the consideration $200 in 7days and $150  with 30 days is appreciated
24/01/24, 4:09 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
24/01/24, 4:13 pm - +265 991 59 81 60: We have gone up to stage 2
24/01/24, 4:13 pm - Kunal: Well,
We are at stage one but we have also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.

In Step 1: Connect with a counsellor- As your counsellor, now we are going through the counselling process, discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

In Step 2:Eligibility Check- The eligibility check includes the interviews with Academic Board and Test.

Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa- If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program- This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.

We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
24/01/24, 4:15 pm - +265 991 59 81 60: Noted thank you
24/01/24, 4:16 pm - Kunal: *Step 5:* After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors. They will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. will be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by paying the registration fee within a few weeks.

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education and the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025). <This message was edited>
24/01/24, 4:16 pm - Kunal: Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment,you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.

I hope you are clear with the process.
24/01/24, 4:17 pm - +265 991 59 81 60: Yes I am
24/01/24, 4:24 pm - Kunal: Alright Joseph, we have come to the end of your counselling session. Before I guide you Step 2 of the Eligibility Check, I want you to have a full-fledged discussion of the Edoofa program within your family as higher education is supposed to be a family decision. Ensure to include these aspects during the discussions:-

*About the EDOOFA Program and its vision of making Education Affordable and Edoofians Employment Ready.*
*Value of the career of an Edoofian after pursuing higher education in India.*
*The financial aspects and how Edoofa brings in affordability and self-financing opportunities for students.*
24/01/24, 4:24 pm - Kunal: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences,

*Edoofa’s Website- www.edoofa.com* 
*Pictures (Edoofians from Africa studying in India): https://tinyurl.com/3ke35s35*

*Please ensure to go through the FAQ document before the next stage and refer the same to your family as it has answers to most of the queries.* Furthermore, if you have any other queries I would suggest that you note them down and we will discuss them in the next session.

Let me also share a few pictures of the students who are studying in India through the Edoofa Program so that you can witness the exposures and their experiences.

02/02/24, 9:03 pm - +265 991 59 81 60: I went to the FDH Bank where I have an account
I was advised to complete an application and to deposit 435,000 Malawi kwacha equivalent to $255.88 being $200 enrollment and $55.88 processing fee which I have done
Secondly, the pointed out that they have centralized foreign exchange processing center,they don't work tomorrow and Sunday work will resume on Monday
On Monday they seek the approval and book for forex
They said they will try to help but the fear is we have only Monday to do the processing and seek the approval of the central Bank also called Reserve Bank
The other challenge to be sorted on Monday Joseph will have to obtain the ID from the National Registration Department in Blantyre for attachment to the documents
Despite these challenges we are fully committed pay the enrollment fees
If possible I humbly seek your kind consideration in case we experience the delay in the approval process
