23/02/24, 9:12 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning Munashe, and Mrs Makuni!

*I am Mr Gurvinder Singh, Senior Career Counselor at Edoofa*

We have received an application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program from your friend and our student.

I hope I have contacted the right person.

I would like you to come online so that I could discuss with you the form you submitted online and what I was able to understand from the same!
23/02/24, 11:09 am - +263 77 524 0230: Thank you Mr Gurvinder.  I am Munashe Hope Muvirimi. Thank for the much needed assistance.
23/02/24, 11:52 am - Gurvinder: It is a pleasure to connect with you today Munashe,

You can address me as Mr Gurvinder, we do have Mr Piiyush, Head of Counselling and  Mr Jyotishman, Head of Admissions who will be evaluating your responses for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
23/02/24, 11:54 am - +263 77 524 0230: Noted. Thank you
23/02/24, 12:01 pm - Gurvinder: Before we begin with the session, I would like to ask you, what prior understanding you have about the Edoofa Scholarship Program
23/02/24, 12:54 pm - +263 77 524 0230: I know Edoofa Scholarship as a program that assist in sponsoring, mentoring individuals wishing to persue their careers and achieving future aspirations
23/02/24, 12:58 pm - Gurvinder: That is correct, let me brief you more.
23/02/24, 12:58 pm - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
23/02/24, 12:58 pm - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
23/02/24, 12:58 pm - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
23/02/24, 12:58 pm - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
23/02/24, 1:08 pm - +263 77 524 0230: Great. I am impressed. Thank you
23/02/24, 1:10 pm - +263 77 524 0230: Yes. I am also looking forward to take responsibility towards my higher education and help my guardian mother reduce financial burden towards my education as she strive to make ends meet
23/02/24, 1:17 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so Munashe, as we start your counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
23/02/24, 1:19 pm - +263 77 524 0230: Yes
23/02/24, 1:20 pm - Gurvinder: Now Munashe, I would like to know you better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about yourself, your career aspiration do include sharing about:-

1. Your highest education level?
2. The course you would like to study?
3. What do your parents do?
4. What is your parent’s highest education level?
5. Who has been supporting you for your Education so far?
6. Who will be supporting you financially for your higher education abroad?
7. Do you have any siblings? if yes, what do they do?
8. May I know which school do you study at and in which province is it located along with that how much was your per-term fee in A level?

Please elaborate on your answers and answer them in points, so that I can understand your application more briefly and assist you in a better way
23/02/24, 1:41 pm - +263 77 524 0230: 1.My highest education level is a Bachelor of Science degree in Optometry
2. I would like to study a Masters degree in Optometry so that I will be able to open my practice in the future and help my sibling to further her studies too
3. Both my parents are deceased when I was in grade 2. I am surviving by my guardian mother who is a primary school teacher.
4. Bachelor of Education in ICT
5. My guardian Mother Tinei Makuni has been supporting my education
6. I am looking forward that guardian mother will support my education abroad although I know that it will be very difficult for her
7. I have one sister  , a biological daughter to my guardian mother who is studying towards a Social Work degree at Zimbabwe Ezekiel Guti University. Which marks the reason why I need financial assistance from Edoofa as my guardian parent cannot afford to pay her fees and mine at the same time
8. I did my A level at Chindunduma High in Mashonaland. Staying with my uncle and School fees was $80 per term
23/02/24, 2:13 pm - Gurvinder: It is a pleasure to know you Munashe.
23/02/24, 2:37 pm - +263 77 524 0230: My pleasure too

23/02/24, 5:52 pm - +263 77 846 3933: Thank u so. My pleasure to meet u. Am so happy that u have considered  Munashe into your scholarship program.
26/02/24, 9:06 am - +263 77 524 0230: Good morning Mr Gurvinder.
26/02/24, 10:50 am - +263 77 846 3933: This message was deleted
26/02/24, 11:44 am - +263 77 846 3933: Good morning Sir
28/02/24, 9:56 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning Everyone,
Hope you are doing well,
Please come online so that we can continue with the session.
28/02/24, 12:31 pm - +263 77 524 0230: How are you sir
28/02/24, 12:33 pm - Gurvinder: I am fine.
28/02/24, 12:34 pm - Gurvinder: So may I know, what were your plans before you knew about the Edoofa program?
28/02/24, 12:38 pm - +263 77 524 0230: I had applied for optometry internship in my country but we only have 5 assessors. I did not secure a place they were already filled up. Waiting for a vacancy to arise next year. I was advised to advance with my education rather than staying idle at home by Anna one of the Edoofa student
28/02/24, 12:41 pm - +263 77 846 3933: How a u sir
28/02/24, 12:51 pm - Gurvinder: I am fine, how are you?
28/02/24, 12:57 pm - +263 77 846 3933: I am Munashe's  guardian. A sister to her late mother. Both his parents are late. I had struggled to educate him up to University Level but he is just iddle at home with nothing to do. He had failed to secure a vacant for internship since he completed his Degree in Optometry because the vacancies are scarce. However someone whom you assisted with a scholarship advised him to apply for a scholarship with that he can further his studies. Of which I found a noble idea than just staying home. I thank you very much for considering my son into the interview. I hope  you will assist him to further his studies which I as a guardian (single mother) who is just a civil servant  had failed to do because her sister is as of now studying for a degree in Social Work at Zimbabwe Ezekiel Guti University. My salary as a teacher does not allow me to pay fees for 2 learners at Tertiary level in Zimbabwe. I hope you will understand my situation and assist. Once again thank u.
28/02/24, 12:59 pm - +263 77 846 3933: Thank you sir
28/02/24, 1:03 pm - +263 77 846 3933: My son is hard working and aspires to further his studies.
28/02/24, 1:26 pm - Gurvinder: It is a pleasure to know you Tinei, but understanding your situation I would like to know, who is going to support Munashe for her higher education?
28/02/24, 1:40 pm - +263 77 846 3933: I had learnt from him that your scholarship programs offers 50 to 80% then 100% if he managed to score as the highest student in the interview that he sat for. If that is the  case let's suppose he managed to secure 80%  of the scholarship fees  I would struggle to pay for the remainder 20%. I don't know if what I learnt from him is correct. You can clarify to m or further explain if that is not the case sir
28/02/24, 1:43 pm - +263 77 846 3933: You can clarify and explain further to me on  what exactly is covered by your scholarship.
28/02/24, 1:45 pm - +263 77 846 3933: He also told me that there is what you call earn while you learn. I hope this will help him to sail through.
28/02/24, 1:57 pm - Gurvinder: Let's asume that your child is only able to get a 50% scholarship how will you manage after that?
28/02/24, 2:08 pm - +263 77 846 3933: I will hustle to secure the 50% am sure it may be a bit hard for me in his first semester but affordable later since her sister will soon complete her studies next year
28/02/24, 2:08 pm - Gurvinder: Noted.
28/02/24, 2:09 pm - Gurvinder: That is great that you are this much dedicated for Munashe's higher education.
28/02/24, 2:09 pm - +263 77 846 3933: Sure sir it pains me a lot to leave him home as I go out for work.
28/02/24, 2:11 pm - Gurvinder: Alright so now can you share your Form 5 results, and the transcripts and degree for the Bachelor's for evaluation?

06/03/24, 10:45 am - Kunal: Let me know once you have gone through the course
06/03/24, 10:45 am - +263 77 846 3933: Ok going through it
06/03/24, 10:47 am - +263 77 846 3933: Thank you very much with the information noted.
06/03/24, 11:13 am - Kunal: Have you understood the coure well? <This message was edited>
06/03/24, 11:15 am - +263 77 846 3933: Yes, I did. It also gave me a bigger picture of the program.
06/03/24, 11:20 am - Kunal: That's a wonderful course that Munashe have settled for, I also have access to the Feedback form that you filled out after the session with your parents and I hope you are aware, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
06/03/24, 11:20 am - Kunal: In simple words what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
06/03/24, 11:24 am - +263 77 846 3933: Thank you very much Mr Kunal and EDOOFA Program for making it possible for us to achieve our dreams .
06/03/24, 11:27 am - Kunal: I am glad to hear that from you
I hope it was quite evident during the Videos played during the presentations that you attended the students working on the Internships and Attachments of the much coveted EArn While You Learn Program manage to earn USD 50- USD 100 Each however since there is no limit to earning students like Persistence Muza were able to also self finance the Cost of Education though students like these are less but I am sure you are highly motivated!
06/03/24, 11:30 am - +263 77 846 3933: Yes I am motivated since it was possible for them I will put effort to make it too.
06/03/24, 11:31 am - Kunal: Alright plase, I hope you also remember Dr. Gupta discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe you were available even if you were not, Munashe might have discussed the same with you so will you be the ones who would be supporting Munashe for higher education.
06/03/24, 11:33 am - +263 77 846 3933: Yes I will be supporting him.
06/03/24, 11:34 am - Kunal: I am glad to hear that
06/03/24, 11:34 am - Kunal: <Media omitted>
06/03/24, 11:35 am - +263 77 846 3933: Yes I am.
06/03/24, 11:35 am - Kunal: So for an Edoofian the Enrollment Fee would include:

*1. Guaranteed Scholarship*
*2. Application fee of all the Edoofa’s Associated Universities*
*3. Cost of Multiple Statement of Purposes drafted*
*4. Recommendation Letter drafted for the Student*
*5. Earn While You Learn Program’s Training*
*6. Visa Assistance*
*7. SLICE CON*
*8. Department of Student Welfare*
*9. Attachments and Internship Opportunities*
06/03/24, 11:36 am - +263 77 846 3933: Ok noted.
06/03/24, 11:36 am - Kunal: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
06/03/24, 11:37 am - Kunal: You see Edoofa's exceptional program has opened up a world of opportunities for aspiring students, garnering thousands of applications on a daily basis. The Eligibility Evaluation process ensures that deserving candidates are granted the chance to participate in the program. *Once accepted, students are requested to pay a nominal Program Fee of $350 within 7 days of receiving their acceptance letter*, following which they commence with their admission process and the esteemed Earn While You Learn Program. Edoofa's mission to provide quality education and support to students is at the heart of this initiative, and we are honored to make a difference in the lives of deserving individuals through this program.
06/03/24, 11:37 am - Kunal: Considering your results of ESAT we also offer an additional waiver of *USD 50* in your Enrollment Fee upon your consideration in the Slice Con 24 Committee Fund. 

Out of a Total of 3000 students only 200 have been given this opportunity, as a counselor I feel it's a great privilege that has been offered to you.
06/03/24, 11:39 am - +263 77 846 3933: Thank you for the opportunity.
06/03/24, 11:39 am - Kunal: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $100 within the next 30 days.*
06/03/24, 11:41 am - +263 77 846 3933: Thank you noted.
06/03/24, 11:42 am - Kunal: You are welcome
Now, let me brief you how the process follows after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.

Are you familiar with the Edoofa Cycle?
06/03/24, 11:43 am - +263 77 846 3933: Yes i am familiar with the cycle
06/03/24, 11:44 am - Kunal: <Media omitted>
06/03/24, 11:45 am - Kunal: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zimbabweitself.
06/03/24, 11:45 am - Kunal: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
06/03/24, 11:47 am - +263 77 846 3933: Yes I understood
06/03/24, 11:49 am - Kunal: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of the registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
06/03/24, 11:50 am - Kunal: Basically, this registration fee will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August/September 2024 and the remaining in January next year 2025.
06/03/24, 11:50 am - Kunal: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
06/03/24, 11:50 am - Kunal: <Media omitted>
06/03/24, 11:52 am - +263 77 846 3933: Thank you noted sir.
06/03/24, 11:55 am - Kunal: Okay so with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check and an Interaction with the Board of Directors.
06/03/24, 11:55 am - Kunal: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
06/03/24, 11:57 am - +263 77 846 3933: I will discuss throughly with them and help them to understand. Thank you it was a great counselling.
06/03/24, 5:11 pm - Kunal: It was an honor to host the session today with you!
As a consequence of my satisfaction with your replies and performance thus far, please allow me to advance your application to Stage 2 of the Edoofa Cycle. Congratulations!!👏🏼👏🏼.

Your next session is at *9:30 a.m. CAT Tomorrow (07/03/2024)* where I will analyze your application and take you through the most critical Eligibility Check Stage. 

Make sure to come on time after having a thorough discussion with your family, and the parents/guardians of the applicant are highly encouraged to be online for the following session as higher education is a family decision.
 
Stay Blessed!
