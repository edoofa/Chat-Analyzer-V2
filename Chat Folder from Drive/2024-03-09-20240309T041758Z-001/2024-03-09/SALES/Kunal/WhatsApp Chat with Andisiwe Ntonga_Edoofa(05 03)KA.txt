What motivated you towards this career? <This message was edited>
06/03/24, 11:30 am - +263 78 167 1121: I was motivated by the desire to help others and make a difference in people's lives. I'm also drawn to the intellectual challenge of nursing and opportunity to use my problem-solving skills. And im attracted to the flexibility and variety that nursing offers. It's truly an amazing field.

06/03/24, 11:54 am - Kunal: Andisiwe, with your interests towards Medical field, why didn't you opt for science combination in A level?
06/03/24, 12:01 pm - +263 78 167 1121: I was placed under the arts combination from O level,so twas hard to pursue science later in A Level because I held arts subjects
06/03/24, 12:03 pm - Kunal: I do understand , Since Medical Education and Engineering are two aspects for which the Indian Education System is known, both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. There fore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are Physics, Chemistry, and Biology. whereas if they want to study any Engineering Course then they should have Physics, Chemistry and Mathematics in their A level mandatorily.
06/03/24, 12:04 pm - +263 78 167 1121: Okay...
06/03/24, 12:05 pm - Kunal: Since you are not having the science subjects, you are not eligible for Nursing
