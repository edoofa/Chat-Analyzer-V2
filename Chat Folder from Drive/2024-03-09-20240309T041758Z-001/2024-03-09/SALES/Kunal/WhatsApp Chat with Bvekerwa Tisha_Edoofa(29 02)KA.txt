08/03/24, 10:14 am - Kunal: Good Morning,

*Spread love everywhere you go.*

On a positive note, I am here to begin our session
Are you ready?
08/03/24, 10:15 am - +263 73 379 2833: Good morning
08/03/24, 10:15 am - +263 73 379 2833: Yes I am ready
08/03/24, 10:16 am - Kunal: It is good to hear from you
How are you doing?
08/03/24, 10:16 am - +263 73 379 2833: I am fine thank you how are you feeling today
08/03/24, 10:38 am - Kunal: I am feeling well, thank you
08/03/24, 10:38 am - Kunal: Have you gone through this?
08/03/24, 11:03 am - +263 73 379 2833: Yes I understood everything
08/03/24, 11:05 am - Kunal: So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians. Looking at this cost of education as well, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits which can help in reducing their fees further.

Do you know how that is done?
08/03/24, 11:07 am - +263 73 379 2833: I'd like love to know more about this
08/03/24, 11:10 am - Kunal: Let me tell you how Edoofa helps Edoofians bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the *Earn While You Learn Program*

The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that are equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.The Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies and needs, converting an Individual into a market-ready professional. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
08/03/24, 11:10 am - Kunal: *Projects with Brands and Companies: -*
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, such as:
*Africa Global Radio-* The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project and hear from the CEO about the exposures of the Edoofa program.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0
*Skooqs-* This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

*Recruitment Partners:-*
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

*Webinars:-*
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars regularly with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
-Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.

08/03/24, 1:39 pm - Kunal: Good Afternoon
Shall we proceed?
08/03/24, 2:24 pm - +263 73 379 2833: Yes
08/03/24, 2:26 pm - +263 73 379 2833: This is really a good way of educating because we are groomed both at school at also leave with skills  because of the earn while u learn programs
08/03/24, 2:30 pm - Kunal: Indeed
If I have to help you explain how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable compared to Local Universities, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now, if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, bringing the cost further down to $1000 per year including the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month. *This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*

*You can see this even in this scholarship credit certificate where one of our star performers, our Proud Edoodians  Masinire Miriam earned $1965 within a year.* I hope you can now realize the power of the EWYL program to reduce the financial pressure on families.

08/03/24, 2:46 pm - +263 73 379 2833: Wow, that's truly an incredible opportunity for students! The Earn While You Learn Program sounds like a game-changer when it comes to making higher education more affordable and accessible for students. It's amazing to see how students can earn scholarship credits to offset tuition fees, food, and accommodation costs, which can significantly reduce the financial burden on families. The flexibility of the program, where students can earn as much as they're willing to work hard, is also a huge plus. It's inspiring to see how some students, like Masinire Miriam, have already taken advantage of the program to great success
08/03/24, 2:47 pm - +263 73 379 2833: Wow this is amazing
08/03/24, 2:50 pm - Kunal: Great, Now, as we are proceeding towards the end, let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, a few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :

*1. Expert Career Counselling:* We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counsellors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.

*2. Affordability through guaranteed scholarships:* Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off.

*3. Earn While You Learn:* The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing our students for the real world. 

*4.Higher Education Concierge:* A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.*

After going through these facts that make Edoofa different, which one out of the 4 did you feel is the most significant?
08/03/24, 3:01 pm - +263 73 379 2833: The "Higher Education Concierge" aspect of the Edoofa program truly stands out to me as the most significant factor. It's not just about providing education or scholarships, but it's also about providing a comprehensive and personalized support system that guides students through every step of their higher education journey. From career selection to internships, Edoofa is like a personal assistant, always available to help students achieve their dreams. This level of personalization is incredibly rare in the world of education, and it's something that sets Edoofa apart. In my opinion, it's a game-changer in the higher education

08/03/24, 3:12 pm - Kunal: That’s understandable,I believe you'll be discussing everything with your family after we complete today's session. Also, after our counselling session, I would connect to some of our beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know their experiences and proceedings well.

May I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
08/03/24, 4:37 pm - Kunal: Are we connected?
