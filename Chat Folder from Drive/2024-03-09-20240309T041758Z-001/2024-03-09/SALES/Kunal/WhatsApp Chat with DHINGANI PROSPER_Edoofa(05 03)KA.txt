Shall I explain the course in depth?
05/03/24, 3:23 pm - +27 72 444 8077: Yes you may explain
05/03/24, 3:24 pm - Kunal: *Bsc in Optometry is a 4 year course*

Bachelor of Optometry is an undergraduate program concerning eye care. Optometry is the science of eye care including eye examination, diagnosis, treatment and management of diseases and disorders of the visual system. It is a vision care science. Bachelor of Optometry is a four-year course containing three years of learning and a year of internship in clinical experience.

It can also be defined as the science of eye equipment (including lenses and spectacles) aimed at improving the vision of the human eye. This involves removal of all kinds of obstacles of sight which an individual may suffer from. This is a dynamic and challenging career, which allows one to nurse people, achieve personal growth, community respect, job flexibility and financial stability.

The core training and practical exposure offered in the course is designed to prepare eligible candidates for providing competent services in capacities such as Optician, Optometrist, Refractionist and Ophthalmic Assistant. A graduate of this stream can serve the community in urban, semi-urban and rural settings in private, semi-governmental and governmental sectors.

Optics is the branch of science involving the structure, function, and operation of the human eye. Optometrists are health professionals who have specialized in eye care. They deal with eye testing and provide solutions to patients suffering from vision disorders such as partial sight, hereditary vision defects, squint, weakening of eye muscles etc. They suggest alternate vision aids such as spectacles or contact lenses.

They also provide preoperative and postoperative care to individual suffering from cataract. Often optometrists discover eye conditions caused by systemic problems, such as diabetes or high blood pressure, and refer their patients to other medical doctors.
Since the eye is one of the most important human organs, optometrists are offered a wide range of lucrative career options both in India and abroad, assigned the responsibility of leading others from darkness to light, literally.

06/03/24, 9:44 am - +27 72 444 8077: Morning there
06/03/24, 9:48 am - Kunal: Good Morning,

*"It takes courage to grow up and become who you really are."*

On a positive note, I am here to begin our session
Are you ready?
06/03/24, 9:54 am - +27 72 444 8077: Thanks you how are you today
06/03/24, 10:12 am - Kunal: I am doing fine, thank you
06/03/24, 10:13 am - Kunal: After going through these amazing facts, can you now tell me? 

How would studying in India implement a positive impact on your child’s career?
06/03/24, 10:23 am - +27 72 444 8077: Its will improve the livehood of everyone in the family including his brothers and sisters as you know the ecomically situation in Zimbabwe it's very bad about 99 % of the people in the country the live in porverty. for him to study in abroad it  will give him more chances  of getting employment.
06/03/24, 10:50 am - Kunal: Indeed, I believe your child would learn a lot from the exposures offered if found eligible and works hard to achieve the dreams. Moving ahead, by any chance are you familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?
06/03/24, 10:51 am - +27 72 444 8077: No
06/03/24, 11:14 am - Kunal: That’s alright, Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India compared to other global hubs.

In India, international students face an average expense of *$6000-$8000 annually.* While this is very low as compared to the Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc where the cost of education ranges from $15000-$35000 annually, it is still beyond the reach of many.

With the Edoofa Scholarship Program, the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000 per annum* for the students who are found eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility Check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Laundry, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
06/03/24, 11:14 am - Kunal: <Media omitted>
06/03/24, 11:31 am - +27 72 444 8077: Understand how much will cost the inclusion the remaining tuition per semester
06/03/24, 11:35 am - Kunal: I have mentioned it here, Mrs Jemiso
06/03/24, 11:44 am - +27 72 444 8077: Okay thanks
06/03/24, 11:44 am - Kunal: So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians. Looking at this cost of education as well, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits which can help in reducing their fees further.

Do you know how that is done?
06/03/24, 11:45 am - +27 72 444 8077: Okay will be helpful
06/03/24, 11:50 am - Kunal: Let me tell you how Edoofa helps Edoofians bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the *Earn While You Learn Program*

The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that are equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.The Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies and needs, converting an Individual into a market-ready professional. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
06/03/24, 11:50 am - Kunal: *Projects with Brands and Companies: -*
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, such as:
*Africa Global Radio-* The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project and hear from the CEO about the exposures of the Edoofa program.

*Skooqs-* This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

*Recruitment Partners:-*
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

*Webinars:-*
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars regularly with the current leaders in the business field.

06/03/24, 1:36 pm - +27 72 444 8077: Yes
06/03/24, 2:01 pm - Kunal: Indeed
If I have to help you explain how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable compared to Local Universities, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now, if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, bringing the cost further down to $1000 per year including the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month. *This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*

*You can see this even in this scholarship credit certificate where one of our star performers, our Proud Edoodians  Masinire Miriam earned $1965 within a year.* I hope you can now realize the power of the EWYL program to reduce the financial pressure on families.

06/03/24, 2:08 pm - +27 72 444 8077: Wow this wonderful
06/03/24, 2:10 pm - Kunal: Great, Now, as we are proceeding towards the end, let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, a few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :

*1. Expert Career Counselling:* We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counsellors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.

*2. Affordability through guaranteed scholarships:* Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off.

*3. Earn While You Learn:* The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing our students for the real world. 

*4.Higher Education Concierge:* A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.*

After going through these facts that make Edoofa different, which one out of the 4 did you feel is the most significant?
06/03/24, 2:27 pm - +27 72 444 8077: 4
06/03/24, 2:27 pm - Kunal: Great! 
So now I know you focus more on quality education, services and guidance
Let me also show you some monthly earnings of students through Earn While You Learn.

06/03/24, 2:28 pm - Kunal: As you see, there is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it depends upon his/her hard work. However, who will be helping Prosper with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
06/03/24, 2:35 pm - +27 72 444 8077: Okay ! Thank you so much I appreciate
06/03/24, 4:31 pm - +27 72 444 8077: Afrternoon Just checking if we have finished session.
06/03/24, 5:07 pm - Kunal: Please address the question
06/03/24, 5:10 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
06/03/24, 7:38 pm - +27 72 444 8077: I will assist Prosper with the remaining fees
07/03/24, 10:01 am - +27 72 444 8077: Morning
07/03/24, 10:43 am - Kunal: Good morning, everyone!

I hope you're all doing well. My sincere apologies for the delay; unfortunately, I wasn't feeling well.

Are we ready to proceed?
07/03/24, 10:44 am - +27 72 444 8077: yes we can go ahead please get well soon
07/03/24, 10:58 am - Kunal: Thank you, Mr Jemiso
07/03/24, 10:58 am - Kunal: I believe you'll be discussing everything with your family after we complete today's session. Also, after our counselling session, I would connect to some of our beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know their experiences and proceedings well.

May I know how you feel about your child studying abroad?
07/03/24, 11:03 am - +27 72 444 8077: I am so excited.
07/03/24, 11:04 am - Kunal: I am glad to hear that, as studying Internationally would make his career advance at an even greater pace, as he will be transformed into a professional with a well-paying job, which would help him in uplifting your family there by himself, and provide a peaceful and hassle-free life to his parents.
07/03/24, 11:04 am - Kunal: *As we move to the last part of the session, let me highlight a few requirements while a student applies alone* 

*1) Application Form* -An online or offline form that asks for your personal details and academic background.

*2) Statement of Purpose-* An essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and your aspirations for your career.

*3) Letter of Recommendation-* from Senior authorities, School Heads or others on why they recommend you to be a right fit for an international university.
Do you know about other requirements?
07/03/24, 11:40 am - +27 72 444 8077: Thank you You may send us those forms
07/03/24, 11:42 am - Kunal: Let me tell that these are not required now as they will be needed at the time of university admission process
When a student applies alone for an international University, on average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose costs between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally and act as a major parameter to decide the child’s eligibility. If you apply to 5 Universities, the average costs for the mentioned would be $1350-$1750, *without even receiving a guarantee to be selected*

*Edoofa has identified a solution for this uncertainty and unaffordability.* If a student qualifies after the eligibility check, not only does Edoofa help them draft their statement of purpose but also helps in terms of Visa Documentation Assistance, University Session and selection, Individual mentorship, etc, reducing the costs significantly to $750 which is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
07/03/24, 11:42 am - Kunal: <Media omitted>
07/03/24, 12:17 pm - +27 72 444 8077: Meaning the recommendation letter need to come from the previous school he was  attending
07/03/24, 12:27 pm - Kunal: That is right
07/03/24, 12:27 pm - Kunal: Please address the same
07/03/24, 12:30 pm - +27 72 444 8077: Perfect
07/03/24, 12:30 pm - Kunal: The enrollment fee is to be paid only if a child is found eligible for the Edoofa Scholarship Program after passing the eligibility check stage, it includes, 

*Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
*Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
*Earn While You Learn Program and training*
*University sessions and selection*
*A guaranteed scholarship seat*
*Visa Documentation Assistance*
*The Foster and Care throughout the course of an Edoofian*
07/03/24, 12:30 pm - Kunal: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge due to which parents might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short period of 7 days and for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option wherein if the student is found eligible, instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, *parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days thereby reducing the financial pressure.*
07/03/24, 12:33 pm - +27 72 444 8077: It be far much better to do so .
07/03/24, 12:33 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
07/03/24, 1:04 pm - +27 72 444 8077: we have discussed all of this
07/03/24, 1:13 pm - Kunal: Well
We also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.

*Step 1:Connect with a counsellor-* As your counsellor, now we are going through the counselling process discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Edoofa Scholarship.                        

*Step 2:Eligibility Check-* The eligibility check includes the interviews with the Academic Board and Scholarship Test.

*Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa-* If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter.

*Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program-* This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.

We are left with steps 5 and 6.
So shall I explain them to you?
07/03/24, 1:15 pm - +27 72 444 8077: yes
07/03/24, 1:16 pm - Kunal: *Step 5:* After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors. They will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. will be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by paying the registration fee within a few weeks.

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education and the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).
07/03/24, 1:16 pm - Kunal: *Step 6 :* Once you are done with the registration fee payment, you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.

I hope you are clear with the process.
07/03/24, 1:21 pm - +27 72 444 8077: Yes it's clear
07/03/24, 1:23 pm - Kunal: We have come to the end of your counselling session. Before I guide you Step 2 of the Eligibility Check, I want you to have a full-fledged discussion of the Edoofa program within your family as higher education is supposed to be a family decision. Ensure to include these aspects during the discussions:-

*About the EDOOFA Program and its vision of making Education Affordable and Edoofians Employment Ready.*
*Value of the career of an Edoofian after pursuing higher education in India.*
*The financial aspects and how Edoofa brings in affordability and self-financing opportunities for students.*
07/03/24, 1:23 pm - Kunal: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences,

*Edoofa’s Website- www.edoofa.com* 
*Pictures (Edoofians from Africa studying in India): https://tinyurl.com/3ke35s35*

*Please ensure to go through the FAQ document before the next stage and refer the same to your family as it has answers to most of the queries.* Furthermore, if you have any other queries I would suggest that you note them down and we will discuss them in the next session.

Let me also share a few pictures of the students who are studying in India through the Edoofa Program so that you can witness the exposures and their experiences.

08/03/24, 2:00 pm - Kunal: Let me help you understand why I am offering a Bachelor of Science in Optometry instead of Ophthalmology
Choosing a Bachelor of Science in Optometry opens the door to a world of opportunities in eye care and ophthalmology. As an optometry student, Prosper will dive delve deep into the study of vision science, ocular anatomy, and visual disorders. This foundational knowledge forms the basis for understanding and diagnosing various eye conditions.

Moreover, optometrists often work closely with ophthalmologists, who specialize in surgical and medical treatments for eye diseases. By pursuing a degree in optometry, Prosper will not only preparing himself for a rewarding career in primary eye care but also laying the groundwork for further specialization in ophthalmology if he choose to pursue it.
