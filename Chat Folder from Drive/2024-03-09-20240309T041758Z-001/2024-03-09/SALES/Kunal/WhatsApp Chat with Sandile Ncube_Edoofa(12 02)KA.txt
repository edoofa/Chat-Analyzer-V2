28/02/24, 3:31 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
28/02/24, 3:36 pm - +263 71 374 7050: I'm delighted about this information you shared.Studying in India would elevate my career to greater heights and bring many career opportunities to me as an individual.  I can also learn vast traditions and cultures. With the education system, it would improve my research and expertise.
28/02/24, 3:40 pm - Kunal: That is amazing, As I can see, you have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead.

*By any chance are you familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship?*
28/02/24, 3:43 pm - +263 71 374 7050: No, i am not familiar but I  can guess it is very expensive like $13,000 USD per year
28/02/24, 3:43 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
28/02/24, 3:43 pm - Kunal: *To understand it better, the reduced cost of education($2000-$3000)per annum includes the remaining tuition fee, food, accommodation and basic necessities such as Wifi, Laundry, Library fees etc. This cost is paid in two equal instalments. Each instalment is paid before a semester. There are two semesters in a year*
28/02/24, 3:45 pm - +263 71 374 7050: Thanks have understood everything
28/02/24, 3:45 pm - Kunal: Good to hear that
So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians. Looking at this cost of education as well, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits which can help in reducing their fees further.

Do you know how that is done?
28/02/24, 3:45 pm - +263 71 374 7050: Looking forward for better studying
28/02/24, 3:46 pm - +263 71 374 7050: Yes
28/02/24, 3:46 pm - Kunal: Let me tell you how Edoofa helps Edoofians bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the *Earn While You Learn Program*

The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that are equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.The Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies and needs, converting an Individual into a market-ready professional. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
28/02/24, 3:46 pm - Kunal: *Projects with Brands and Companies: -*
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, such as:
*Africa Global Radio-* The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project and hear from the CEO about the exposures of the Edoofa program.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4DAP24ZuY4&authuser=0
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0
*Skooqs-* This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

*Recruitment Partners:-*
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

*Webinars:-*
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars regularly with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
-Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
-How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi
-How to be industry-ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu
-It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje
-Decoding the science of personal branding by Mr, Simon Maingi
28/02/24, 3:46 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
28/02/24, 3:50 pm - +263 71 374 7050: Of course. I'm looking forward since the EWYL relieves the burden of higher costs and is beneficial for everyone.  It introduces students to innovation, creativity, employment and pleasure.  It enhances relief as one may get money to cover other living expenses
28/02/24, 3:52 pm - Kunal: Indeed
If I have to help you explain how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable compared to Local Universities, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now, if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, bringing the cost further down to $1000 per year including the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month. *This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*

*You can see this even in this scholarship credit certificate where one of our star performers, our Proud Edoodians  Masinire Miriam earned $1965 within a year.* I hope you can now realize the power of the EWYL program to reduce the financial pressure on families.
28/02/24, 3:52 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
28/02/24, 3:54 pm - +263 71 374 7050: Thanks,  i have realized. Looking forward to the program.
28/02/24, 3:55 pm - Kunal: Great, Now, as we are proceeding towards the end, let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, a few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :

*1. Expert Career Counselling:* We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counsellors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.

*2. Affordability through guaranteed scholarships:* Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off.

*3. Earn While You Learn:* The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing our students for the real world. 

*4.Higher Education Concierge:* A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.*

After going through these facts that make Edoofa different, which one out of the 4 did you feel is the most significant?
28/02/24, 3:55 pm - +263 71 374 7050: Such a beneficial program. 👍👍Good work to Edoofa
28/02/24, 3:57 pm - +263 71 374 7050: The EWYL since it introduces students to the world by making them exposed to prefered careers and create life long interaction with prominent people. It serves as helping aid for many disadvantaged students.
28/02/24, 4:02 pm - Kunal: Great! 
So now I know you focus more on affordability and employability.
Let me also show you some monthly earnings of students through Earn While You Learn.

28/02/24, 4:02 pm - Kunal: As you see, there is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it depends upon his/her hard work. However, who will be helping you with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
28/02/24, 4:03 pm - +263 71 374 7050: Alright thanks
28/02/24, 4:04 pm - Kunal: You can address this as well
28/02/24, 4:06 pm - +263 71 374 7050: My mother would provide a helping hand with other expenses. I would also look for a part time job to cover food,transportation and accommodation
28/02/24, 4:06 pm - Kunal: That’s understandable,I believe you'll be discussing everything with your family after we complete today's session. Also, after our counselling session, I would connect to some of our beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know their experiences and proceedings well.

May I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
28/02/24, 4:07 pm - +263 71 374 7050: They feel excited and relieved of the high cost of education in my country.They are looking forward to success as I embark on this journey of studying.
28/02/24, 4:07 pm - Kunal: I am glad to hear that, as studying Internationally would make your career advance at an even greater pace, as you will be transformed into a professional with a well-paying job, which would help you in uplifting your family there by yourself, and provide a peaceful and hassle-free life to your parents.
28/02/24, 4:07 pm - Kunal: *As we move to the last part of the session, let me highlight a few requirements while a student applies alone* 

*1) Application Form* -An online or offline form that asks for your personal details and academic background.

*2) Statement of Purpose-* An essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and your aspirations for your career.

*3) Letter of Recommendation-* from Senior authorities, School Heads or others on why they recommend you to be a right fit for an international university.
Do you know about other requirements?
28/02/24, 4:09 pm - +263 71 374 7050: So i have to apply offline
28/02/24, 4:09 pm - +263 71 374 7050: Let me give you my recommendation
28/02/24, 4:13 pm - +263 71 374 7050: <Media omitted>
28/02/24, 4:13 pm - +263 71 374 7050: When should i write the statement of purpose.
28/02/24, 4:15 pm - +263 71 374 7050: No, I don't know about other requirements
28/02/24, 4:16 pm - Kunal: Thank you for sharing
28/02/24, 4:16 pm - Kunal: Let me guide you ahead
28/02/24, 4:16 pm - +263 71 374 7050: It's a pleasure
28/02/24, 4:16 pm - Kunal: When a student applies alone for an international University, on average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose costs between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally and act as a major parameter to decide the child’s eligibility. If you apply to 5 Universities, the average costs for the mentioned would be $1350-$1750, *without even receiving a guarantee to be selected*

*Edoofa has identified a solution for this uncertainty and unaffordability.* If a student qualifies after the eligibility check, not only does Edoofa help them draft their statement of purpose but also helps in terms of Visa Documentation Assistance, University Session and selection, Individual mentorship, etc, reducing the costs significantly to $750 which is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
28/02/24, 4:16 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
28/02/24, 4:18 pm - +263 71 374 7050: Yes,inform me
28/02/24, 4:19 pm - +263 71 374 7050: How about maybe i pay in round 10
28/02/24, 4:24 pm - +263 71 374 7050: What's the next procedure
28/02/24, 4:24 pm - +263 71 374 7050: How do you write the statement of purpose
28/02/24, 4:28 pm - Kunal: Since your application was initiated during Round 7, you'll need to follow the procedures outlined for that round.
28/02/24, 4:28 pm - +263 71 374 7050: Okay
28/02/24, 4:29 pm - +263 71 374 7050: So the fee is $350
28/02/24, 4:29 pm - Kunal: The enrollment fee is to be paid only if a child is found eligible for the Edoofa Scholarship Program after passing the eligibility check stage, it includes, 

*Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
*Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
*Earn While You Learn Program and training*
*University sessions and selection*
*A guaranteed scholarship seat*
*Visa Documentation Assistance*
*The Foster and Care throughout the course of an Edoofian*
28/02/24, 4:29 pm - Kunal: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge due to which parents might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short period of 7 days and for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option wherein if the student is found eligible, instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, *parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days thereby reducing the financial pressure.*
28/02/24, 4:30 pm - +263 71 374 7050: Alright i understand
28/02/24, 4:30 pm - +263 71 374 7050: Thanks
28/02/24, 4:30 pm - Kunal: This message was deleted
28/02/24, 4:31 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
28/02/24, 4:35 pm - +263 71 374 7050: We are in Stage 1 which is the personalized counseling session
28/02/24, 4:37 pm - Kunal: Well, Sandile,
We also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.

*Step 1:Connect with a counsellor-* As your counsellor, now we are going through the counselling process discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Edoofa Scholarship.                        

*Step 2:Eligibility Check-* The eligibility check includes the interviews with the Academic Board and Scholarship Test.

*Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa-* If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter.

*Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program-* This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.

We are left with steps 5 and 6.
So shall I explain them to you? <This message was edited>
28/02/24, 4:41 pm - +263 71 374 7050: Yes
28/02/24, 4:44 pm - Kunal: *Step 5:* After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors. They will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. will be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by paying the registration fee within a few weeks.

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education and the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).
28/02/24, 4:44 pm - Kunal: *Step 6 :* Once you are done with the registration fee payment, you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.

I hope you are clear with the process.
