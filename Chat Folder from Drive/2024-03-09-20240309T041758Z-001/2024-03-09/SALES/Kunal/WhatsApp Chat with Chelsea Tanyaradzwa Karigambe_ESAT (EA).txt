05/03/24, 10:01 am - Kunal: Okay so Tanyaradzwa, as we start discussing your results further, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 


Qualification to the ESAT Exam (Please note EDOOFA calculates your results based on the TOP performers' Score so it is the percentile that we will be evaluating on)
A Level and Previous Results 
*Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 
*Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these Four  significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?

07/03/24, 11:32 am - Kunal: Let me help you understand

I also have access to the feedback form you completed after the session with your parents. As you may be aware, for the selected students qualifying for the EDOOFA Program through various tests, the overall cost is reduced to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost covers:

Remaining Tuition fees (if any)
Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)
Food
Accommodation
This comprehensive fee structure is designed to encompass various essential aspects of your academic journey and living arrangements.
07/03/24, 11:33 am - Kunal: In simple words Tanyaradzwa what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
07/03/24, 11:33 am - Kunal: *To understand it better, the reduced cost of education($2000-$3000)per annum includes the remaining tuition fee, food, accommodation and basic necessities such as Wifi, Laundry, Library fees etc. This cost is paid in two equal instalments. Each instalment is paid before a semester. There are two semesters in a year*
07/03/24, 1:27 pm - +263 77 841 7798: Okay I understand now
07/03/24, 1:28 pm - Kunal: That's great!
I hope it was quite evident during the Videos played during the presentations that you attended the students working on the Internships and Attachments of the much coveted Earn While You Learn Program manage to earn USD 50- USD 100 Each however since there is no limit to earning students like Persistence Muza were able to also self finance the Cost of Education though students like these are less but I am sure you are highly motivated!

07/03/24, 3:05 pm - +263 77 841 7798: Yess my aunt will be the one supporting me
07/03/24, 3:10 pm - Kunal: Noted

07/03/24, 3:12 pm - +263 77 841 7798: Yess I’m ready
07/03/24, 3:23 pm - Kunal: So for an Edoofian the Enrollment Fee would include:

*1. Guaranteed Scholarship*
*2. Application fee of all the Edoofa’s Associated Universities*
*3. Cost of Multiple Statement of Purposes drafted*
*4. Recommendation Letter drafted for the Student*
*5. Earn While You Learn Program’s Training*
*6. Visa Assistance*
*7. SLICE CON*
*8. Department of Student Welfare*
*9. Attachments and Internship Opportunities*
07/03/24, 3:25 pm - +263 77 841 7798: Okay noted
07/03/24, 3:25 pm - Kunal: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
07/03/24, 3:25 pm - Kunal: You see Edoofa's exceptional program has opened up a world of opportunities for aspiring students, garnering thousands of applications on a daily basis. The Eligibility Evaluation process ensures that deserving candidates are granted the chance to participate in the program. *Once accepted, students are requested to pay a nominal Program Fee of $350 within 7 days of receiving their acceptance letter*, following which they commence with their admission process and the esteemed Earn While You Learn Program. Edoofa's mission to provide quality education and support to students is at the heart of this initiative, and we are honored to make a difference in the lives of deserving individuals through this program.
07/03/24, 3:26 pm - Kunal: Considering your results of ESAT we also offer an additional waiver of *USD 50* in your Enrollment Fee upon your consideration in the Slice Con 24 Committee Fund. 

Out of a Total of 3000 students only 200 have been given this opportunity, as a counselor I feel it's a great privilege that has been offered to you.
07/03/24, 3:31 pm - +263 77 841 7798: Thank you for that I appreciate
07/03/24, 3:33 pm - Kunal: However Tanyaradzwa, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $100 within the next 30 days.*
07/03/24, 3:36 pm - +263 77 841 7798: Okay I understand
07/03/24, 3:43 pm - Kunal: Now, let me brief you how the process follows after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.

Are you familiar with the Edoofa Cycle?
07/03/24, 3:44 pm - +263 77 841 7798: Nooo I’m not
07/03/24, 3:44 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
07/03/24, 3:45 pm - Kunal: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zimbabwe itself.
07/03/24, 3:45 pm - Kunal: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
07/03/24, 3:57 pm - +263 77 841 7798: Yesss understood thank you
07/03/24, 4:01 pm - Kunal: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of the registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
07/03/24, 4:01 pm - Kunal: Basically, this registration fee will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August/September 2024 and the remaining in January next year 2025.
07/03/24, 4:01 pm - Kunal: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
07/03/24, 4:41 pm - Kunal: Are you clear?
07/03/24, 4:48 pm - +263 77 841 7798: Okay I understand
07/03/24, 4:48 pm - Kunal: Okay so with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check and an Interaction with the Board of Directors.
07/03/24, 4:48 pm - Kunal: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
07/03/24, 4:48 pm - Kunal: Also, I am sharing some pictures of the students who are studying in India through the Edoofa Program
