05/03/24, 10:16 am - Kunal: It is good to hear from you
How are you doing?
05/03/24, 10:16 am - +263 71 764 5793: I’m alright thanks how are you
05/03/24, 10:17 am - Kunal: I am doing fine, thank you
05/03/24, 10:19 am - +263 71 764 5793: Well I’m a bit confused the winners which we were told are the only ones who got the scholarship offer ? Or some of us still stand a chance to get it
05/03/24, 10:21 am - Kunal: I understand that you were a part of the grand event and presentation by the esteemed Founders of the Edoofa Program Mr. Angad Singh and Mr. Avreen Singh. 

*Your results for the ESAT 2024 is 69/100*
05/03/24, 10:21 am - Kunal: You still have a chance to secure a place, Georgina
05/03/24, 10:22 am - +263 71 764 5793: Ohh okay
05/03/24, 10:23 am - +263 71 764 5793: So what am I expected to do to secure a place ?
05/03/24, 10:31 am - Kunal: I will be guiding you regarding the same ahead
05/03/24, 10:31 am - Kunal: Dear Parent and Student, we understand you have gone through the Brochures and Flyers of the Edoofa Program.
To emphasize  *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and has been rewarding meritorious students to lower their Fee Structure less than what you will end up paying at the Local Zimbabwe University
05/03/24, 10:31 am - +263 71 764 5793: Okay thank you
05/03/24, 10:58 am - Kunal: Okay so Georgina, as we start discussing your results further, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 


Qualification to the ESAT Exam (Please note EDOOFA calculates your results based on the TOP performers' Score so it is the percentile that we will be evaluating on)
A Level and Previous Results 
*Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 
*Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these Four  significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
05/03/24, 11:03 am - +263 71 764 5793: Yes I have what it takes
05/03/24, 11:04 am - Kunal: Alright Georgina, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.

05/03/24, 11:47 am - Kunal: May I know with your interests in Pharmacy, why didn't you opt for Physics at A level?
05/03/24, 11:50 am - +263 71 764 5793: Well at the school I learnt you had to pick between the two biology or physics you couldn’t do both
05/03/24, 11:51 am - Kunal: I do understand , Since Medical Education and Engineering are two aspects for which the Indian Education System is known, both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. There fore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are Physics, Chemistry, and Biology. whereas if they want to study any Engineering Course then they should have Physics, Chemistry and Mathematics in their A level mandatorily.
05/03/24, 11:51 am - Kunal: Since you are not having Physics, I regret to inform you that you are not eligible for Pharmacy, but considering your interest and passion in the field there are courses from Medical Field itself that you are eligible for and which can help you fulfil your dreams of working in this field

05/03/24, 12:05 pm - Kunal: In simple words NAME what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
05/03/24, 12:06 pm - +263 71 764 5793: Okay that’s wonderful
05/03/24, 12:07 pm - +263 71 764 5793: Thank you
05/03/24, 12:14 pm - Kunal: I hope it was quite evident during the Videos played during the presentations that you attended the students working on the Internships and Attachments of the much coveted EArn While You Learn Program manage to earn USD 50- USD 100 Each however since there is no limit to earning students like Persistence Muza were able to also self finance the Cost of Education though students like these are less but I am sure you are highly motivated!
05/03/24, 12:16 pm - +263 71 764 5793: The videos were detailed

Shall we proceed?
05/03/24, 2:03 pm - +263 71 764 5793: Yes
05/03/24, 2:03 pm - Kunal: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
05/03/24, 2:03 pm - Kunal: You see Edoofa's exceptional program has opened up a world of opportunities for aspiring students, garnering thousands of applications on a daily basis. The Eligibility Evaluation process ensures that deserving candidates are granted the chance to participate in the program. *Once accepted, students are requested to pay a nominal Program Fee of $350 within 7 days of receiving their acceptance letter*, following which they commence with their admission process and the esteemed Earn While You Learn Program. Edoofa's mission to provide quality education and support to students is at the heart of this initiative, and we are honored to make a difference in the lives of deserving individuals through this program.
05/03/24, 2:04 pm - Kunal: Considering your results of ESAT we also offer an additional waiver of *USD 50* in your Enrollment Fee upon your consideration in the Slice Con 24 Committee Fund. 

Out of a Total of 3000 students only 200 have been given this opportunity, as a counselor I feel it's a great privilege that has been offered to you.
05/03/24, 2:07 pm - +263 71 764 5793: Thank you for the opportunity 
I feel honoured
05/03/24, 2:07 pm - +263 71 764 5793: So the acceptance letter comes after the counselling session?
05/03/24, 2:11 pm - Kunal: You will be getting the letter only if you clear the eligibility interview in the next session
05/03/24, 2:11 pm - Kunal: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $100 within the next 30 days.*
05/03/24, 2:13 pm - +263 71 764 5793: Okay
05/03/24, 2:13 pm - +263 71 764 5793: That’s better thank you <This message was edited>
05/03/24, 2:18 pm - Kunal: Now, let me brief you how the process follows after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.

Are you familiar with the Edoofa Cycle?
05/03/24, 2:22 pm - +263 71 764 5793: No I’m not
05/03/24, 2:22 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
05/03/24, 2:22 pm - Kunal: Alright NAME, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zimbabwe itself.
05/03/24, 2:22 pm - Kunal: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
05/03/24, 2:24 pm - +263 71 764 5793: Yess I understand
05/03/24, 2:25 pm - Kunal: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of the registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
05/03/24, 2:25 pm - Kunal: Basically, this registration fee will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August/September 2024 and the remaining in January next year 2025.
05/03/24, 2:25 pm - Kunal: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
05/03/24, 2:25 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
05/03/24, 2:27 pm - +263 71 764 5793: Okay thank you for explaining

05/03/24, 2:29 pm - Kunal: I will be sharing the same with you
05/03/24, 2:29 pm - Kunal: Okay so with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check and an Interaction with the Board of Directors.
05/03/24, 2:29 pm - Kunal: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-
