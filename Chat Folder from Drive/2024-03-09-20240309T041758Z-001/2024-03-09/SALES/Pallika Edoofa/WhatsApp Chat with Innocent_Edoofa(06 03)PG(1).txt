06/03/24, 1:43 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Welcome to the session, Mr. Mavimba,
How are you doing today?
06/03/24, 1:44 pm - Pallika Edoofa: As per the program protocols, it's essential to have the representation of students/parents or whoever is supporting the child’s education in the group. This ensures that you follow the sessions, comprehend the program thoroughly, and pose any questions that arise. Given that higher education is a significant decision requiring family support. If they are currently unavailable, they can still join the group and catch up on the conversations later.

*So, I am making you the group admin. Please add Innocent and his mother to the group. Let me know if there is any challenge.*
06/03/24, 2:17 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Please excuse me for some time as I am heading for my lunch. Let us connect at 03:15 pm CAT for the next part of our session. Let me know if you have any challenges with the schedule.

08/03/24, 4:49 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Hi Innocent, I hope you are in good health.

I was hoping to connect with you and take your application forward to check your eligibility for the Edoofa Scholarship Program as we have discussed your application, but since you didn’t respond, I am afraid I will have to put your application on hold temporarily. However please Note by Saturday, I would have to submit my final response regarding your application, so failure to get back to me would mean cancellation of your application after which you would have to re-apply  

Feel free to connect with me again, when you think you are ready to proceed further. Below is a video explaining the details of the Edoofa Program
