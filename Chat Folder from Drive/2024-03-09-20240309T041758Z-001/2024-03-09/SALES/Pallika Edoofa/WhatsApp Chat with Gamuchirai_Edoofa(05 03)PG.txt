05/03/24, 12:02 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Gamuchirai, Please note that the Edoofa Scholarship offers 50-100% scholarship on the tuition fees and based on the performance and evaluations of our Academic Board, one can even achieve a higher quantum of the scholarship but the remaining cost after the scholarship such as Living and Transportation is catered by a student's family.  I will be guiding you through the financial aspects of the program.

Will you be able to manage the remaining expenses?
05/03/24, 12:40 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Please excuse me for some time as I am heading for my lunch. Let us connect at 01:45 pm CAT for the next part of our session. Let me know if you have any challenges with the schedule.
