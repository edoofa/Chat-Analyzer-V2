As scheduled, I am here to begin your sessions for the Edoofa Scholarship Program and evaluate your application.

Are you ready to begin?
05/03/24, 9:50 am - +263 77 600 5218: Yes I'm ready
05/03/24, 10:03 am - Pallika Edoofa: Welcome to the session, Prosper,
How are you doing today?
05/03/24, 10:03 am - Pallika Edoofa: As per the program protocols, it's essential to have the representation of your parents/guardians or whoever is supporting your education in the group. This ensures that they can follow the sessions, comprehend the program thoroughly, and pose any questions they may have. Given that higher education is a significant decision requiring family support. If they are currently unavailable, they can still join the group and catch up on the conversations later.


*So, I am making you the group admin, please add your parents/guardians or educational supporters and let me know the names and the relations once done.*

07/03/24, 11:03 am - +263 77 600 5218: In a nutshell, the Edoofa Scholarship is a program that aims to expand access to education by using technology to connect students with high-quality learning opportunities. The scholarship is designed to help individuals who have faced barriers to education, such as lack of access to quality schools or other educational opportunities. The scholarship also seeks to promote innovation and change in the field of education by supporting individuals who are working to create new and better ways to deliver education.

I will be guiding you through the financial aspects of the program.

Will you be able to manage the remaining expenses?

07/03/24, 11:16 am - Pallika Edoofa: Please note that following successful completion of the eligibility check test and interview, your scholarship percentage will be determined based on your academic board's assessment. Additionally, the percentage may vary depending on the course you select.

Are we good to continue?
07/03/24, 4:06 pm - +263 77 600 5218: Yes
07/03/24, 4:18 pm - Pallika Edoofa: So, Prosper, I hope that your parents are willing to support you financially?
07/03/24, 4:19 pm - +263 77 600 5218: Is it a scholarship or I'm a bit confused
07/03/24, 4:22 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Please note that Edoofa is a partially funded scholarship program! 

The final percentage of the scholarship will be decided after the University Sessions of an Edoofian after his/her enrollment

The percentage of scholarships is determined by the following factors

1) Academic Excellence
2) Merit
3) Previous Experiences
4) Recommendations from Edoofa
5) Statement of Purpose(SOP) 
6) Extracurricular Activities

So the universities will evaluate them to decide the final quantum of the scholarship
07/03/24, 4:23 pm - +263 77 600 5218: I guess if we start from there we might work something out
07/03/24, 4:25 pm - Pallika Edoofa: You see, Prosper, Please note that the Edoofa Scholarship offers 50-100% scholarship on the tuition fees and based on the performance and evaluations of our Academic Board, one can even achieve a higher quantum of the scholarship but the remaining cost after the scholarship such as Living and Transportation is catered by a student's family.  I will be guiding you through the financial aspects of the program.
07/03/24, 4:25 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Also, Students can get the opportunity *_to earn while you learn_*, as they get to work on real-time projects by which they will earn scholarship credits worth 50-100$ or more a month which will help to reduce their tuition fees!
