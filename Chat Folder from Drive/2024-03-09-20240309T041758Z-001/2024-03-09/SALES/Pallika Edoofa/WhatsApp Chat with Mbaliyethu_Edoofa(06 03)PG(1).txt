He is a motivational speaker and very confident with public speaking.  He had 3 siblings a brother and 2 sisters.

07/03/24, 10:14 am - Pallika Edoofa: Ms. Tsepang, As you know, higher education is a big decision that can create a significant impact on your child’s future

As a parent, what are your financial plans and preparations for it so that your child receives access to the best opportunities?
07/03/24, 10:18 am - +263 77 271 9162: Iam not getting you hear and l have not been told any details about the schoolarship what it covers and what it does not cover l think that should be made clear from the onset so that l make an informed decision.  I thought the scholarship is there to help me cover the fees and the like.
07/03/24, 10:22 am - Pallika Edoofa: Dear Parent, Please note that the Edoofa Scholarship offers 50-100% scholarship on the tuition fees and based on the performance and evaluations of our Academic Board, one can even achieve a higher quantum of the scholarship but the remaining cost after the scholarship such as Living and Transportation is catered by a student's family.  I will be guiding you through the financial aspects of the program.

Will you be able to manage the remaining expenses?
07/03/24, 10:24 am - +263 77 271 9162: Noted l can be able to answer that after l have seen the figures of other expenses.  And also what the programme is offering
07/03/24, 10:32 am - +263 77 271 9162: And also l need an offer letter giving details of the programme that he had been offered and the University enrolling him l think that's what we must get engaged to before talking about financial implications my thought though.
07/03/24, 11:06 am - +263 77 271 9162: Madam are we done for today l will be getting out of network coverage if we are finished today's session.
07/03/24, 11:17 am - Pallika Edoofa: Dear Parent, see, I would like to clarify here that as we proceed, if a child wants to get enrolled in the program for that he has to be found eligible for the program and that is after clearing the eligibility check test and the interview and after that a student will gets enrolled and after that the procedure of admission starts.
07/03/24, 11:18 am - +263 77 271 9162: Okay kindly clarify the eligibility criteria madam.
07/03/24, 11:31 am - Pallika Edoofa: Please note that the critieria will be as the student will be having the basic knowledge regarding their course and the must is 2 A level passes, as you see I want to brief you that the criteria before the pandemic was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is *a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.
07/03/24, 11:35 am - +263 77 271 9162: Noted the last sentence you mean achieving 2 A level passes?  Forgive me l need to understand every detail.
07/03/24, 12:14 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Yes, A child needs to have 2 A level passes in his/her A level
07/03/24, 12:16 pm - +263 77 271 9162: If he does then what's the next step?
07/03/24, 12:19 pm - Pallika Edoofa: So, Dear Parent, the next step will be finalizing the course, please!
07/03/24, 12:20 pm - +263 77 271 9162: Okay fine
07/03/24, 12:23 pm - Pallika Edoofa: This message was deleted

07/03/24, 3:25 pm - +263 77 271 9162: Ok
07/03/24, 3:25 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Please note that we don't have an office in Zimbabwe since it would be challenging to set up an office in the 29+ countries from which we receive applications. The nearest office to you would be in Kitwe, Zambia. If you have known people in Zambia, I can guide you to visit our office. We have visits to Zimbabwe every year to prepare our Edoofians for their intake and since your child is studying in Harare, I would like to share that Harare is very close to us as our founders hosted Education summits last year as well as this year. We are associated with many schools in Harare, some of them are the Nation's best schools, including *St. Dominic’s Chishawasha, Dominican Convent High, Christ Ministries, Mablereigh Girls High, St Ignatius, St John's, Harare High, Advent Hope Academy etc*

08/03/24, 11:31 am - +263 77 271 9162: I understood that this programme helps students to get hold on with both academic and real work experience through its work study programme where students gets credits points which are not claimbale as cash but are used to lower their fees.  The program also catering for tuition fees and some on the expenses have to be borne by the student and his family such as transportation visa fees and some living expenses.  I also understood that the program is a global programs and helps international students to obtain internationally recognised qualifications which enhances their chances of employability globally.  There are mentors and chancellors who takes a good care of the students throughout their entire educational journey.  I read that the fees depending upon an institution admitted ranges from 2000-3000 per annum as the rest is taken care by the scholarship.  Students are not able to take up job offers in India as their visas are for study but they can take internship programmes.Thats my understanding.
