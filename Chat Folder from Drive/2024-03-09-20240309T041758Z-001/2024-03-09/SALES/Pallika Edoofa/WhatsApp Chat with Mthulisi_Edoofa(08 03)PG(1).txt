08/03/24, 10:02 am - Pallika Edoofa: Dear Parent,  I will be guiding you through all the aspects of the Edoofa Program. However, just before we delve into that, I would like to get to know you better as a parent.

Please take a moment to share about yourself, including your occupation, highest educational qualification, your province, and what motivates you to support your child ahead for education.
08/03/24, 10:17 am - +263 77 449 2923: I'm a parent of seven children, 5 girls and 3 boys.I have served in many companies such as Nyaradzo,a funeral service in Zimbabwe a social worker in child protection and  currently I'm at a mission school called Usher high School serving as a security guard.I wrote my  exams in   1979 and acquired 2b's and 4 C's and that's when I went on to do social work.Out of all my children Mthulisi is the first one to finish Advanced level and I'm looking forward for him to acquire education so that he can take care of the family. I will be retiring next year in June and I don't think I will be able to finance him to proceed with his education so I had to push him to search for a scholarship
08/03/24, 10:18 am - Pallika Edoofa: It is good to know more about you, Mr. Emmanuel, I am glad that you have a good vision for the career of your child and I believe it will come true if he is found eligible for the program

08/03/24, 11:11 am - +263 77 449 2923: Mthulisi sat for his Ordinary level in 2021 and proceeded to Advanced level in 2022-2023 doing Family and Religious Studies, History and Ndebele.He has always liked anything that has to do with media and when I asked him he had to say that loud that I want to do media studies .He spends much time playing music and during weekends he teaches some of his friends music, playing drums, keyboard,brass band and many more from which they appointed him the bandmaster.He is  passionate about everything he does at one point I almost advised him to be a teacher because he would be patient  person in teaching his friends.He has 3 elder sisters,2 young sisters and 2 twin little brothers.He sat for his O level and A level at Usher High school.I have been supporting him he paying $27 per term.Usher high is a girls high but I just had to send him there despite being a boy living with him in the cottage so that it wouldn't strain me financially because the his other two sisters are also at school and I need to take care of three households and my salary would not allow that.He finished his A level last year2023.He lives in Matebeleland.He is a person who can lead others because he was the headboy last year at Usher high School and a leader in some other church brigades.what I know is he is very short temperd but he will never show that out
