This ensures that you follow the sessions, comprehend the program thoroughly, and pose any questions that arise. Given that higher education is a significant decision requiring family support. If they are currently unavailable, they can still join the group and catch up on the conversations later.

As a parent, what are your financial plans and preparations for it so that your child receives access to the best opportunities?
27/02/24, 3:12 pm - +263 77 375 2267: As a parent my financial plans and preparations is for Edoofa to consider my son hundred percent Scholarship
27/02/24, 3:14 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Mr. Collen, Please note that Edoofa is a partially funded scholarship program! 

The final percentage of the scholarship will be decided after the University Sessions of an Edoofian after his/her enrollment

The percentage of scholarships is determined by the following factors

1) Academic Excellence
2) Merit
3) Previous Experiences
4) Recommendations from Edoofa
5) Statement of Purpose(SOP) 
6) Extracurricular Activities

So the universities will evaluate them to decide the final quantum of the scholarship
27/02/24, 3:15 pm - +263 77 375 2267: Furthermore l do not want to disappoint my son as l am at times failing to put food on the table
27/02/24, 3:17 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Mr. Collen, I do understand the challenges, did you manage to compare the cost of education in Zimbabwe with that through the Edoofa Scholarship Program?
27/02/24, 3:17 pm - Pallika Edoofa: You see, Our Senior Academician was in Zimbabwe for 4 months last year and let me highlight the importance of this opportunity for Zimbabwean students. I want you to think about this situation, where you are studying at UZ. The Tuition fee at UZ ranges from $1000-$1200 per annum with hikes most of the years. The living expenses in Zimbabwe are much more costly than in India. Even the staple diet sadza costs $1 per meal. So you have to spend around $3 per or more per day for meals. A taxi ride for a short distance costs $1, Wi-Fi costs $120 per month, the living rents are high with hikes and the unemployment rates are increasing. Many students work at petrol pumps, markets, selling SIM cards etc after graduation. You might have observed this. All in all, students studying in Zimbabwe have informed us they have to meet an expense of about $3000 or more per annum.
27/02/24, 3:17 pm - Pallika Edoofa: At the same time, Edoofians are studying here in India at a cost much less than that of Zimbabwe and even self-sponsoring their education through the Earn While You Learn Program. We also ensure they develop employability skills so that they are job-ready by the time they graduate. I believe you are looking forward to such an opportunity for your child’s career, aren't you?
27/02/24, 3:17 pm - +263 77 375 2267: I do understand you very much
27/02/24, 3:17 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Also, Mr. Collen, Students can get the opportunity *_to earn while you learn_*, as they get to work on real-time projects by which they will earn scholarship credits worth 50-100$ or more a month which will help to reduce their tuition fees!
27/02/24, 3:18 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
27/02/24, 3:18 pm - +263 77 375 2267: I am happy to hear that
27/02/24, 3:23 pm - +263 77 375 2267: I was very happy to hear some good news from Persistence Muza that she is managing everything for himself
27/02/24, 3:27 pm - +263 77 375 2267: Is able to pay school fees on his own
27/02/24, 3:36 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Yes, Mr. Collen!
27/02/24, 3:36 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Please note that the Edoofa Scholarship offers 50-100% scholarship on the tuition fees and based on the performance and evaluations of our Academic Board, one can even achieve a higher quantum of the scholarship but the remaining cost after the scholarship such as Living and Transportation is catered by a student's family.  I will be guiding you through the financial aspects of the program.

Will you be able to manage the remaining expenses?
27/02/24, 3:41 pm - +263 77 375 2267: Wil hav to work hard to manage it
27/02/24, 3:43 pm - +263 77 375 2267: Everything is possible with God
27/02/24, 3:46 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I appreciate your efforts Mr. Collen!
27/02/24, 3:47 pm - +263 77 375 2267: Thank you
27/02/24, 3:48 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Moving forward, please send Tinashe's O level and term results with me, preferably in picture format for his academic evaluation.
27/02/24, 3:51 pm - +263 77 375 2267: Wil do so not at home now
27/02/24, 4:35 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>

*"If you can dream it, you can do it."*

28/02/24, 9:56 am - +263 77 375 2267: Yes we can

28/02/24, 10:16 am - Pallika Edoofa: Thank you for sending,
As your evaluation progresses, I appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country. In this process did you do any prior research on foreign education or applied to any University abroad?
28/02/24, 10:18 am - +263 77 375 2267: This is my first time for my son Tinashe
28/02/24, 10:18 am - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
28/02/24, 10:22 am - +263 77 375 2267: Yes l have gone through it and understand it's contents
28/02/24, 10:25 am - Pallika Edoofa: Continuing the discussion, I would like to know if Tinashe is interested in the medical field, so why hasn't opted for  Biology in the A level?
28/02/24, 10:27 am - +263 77 375 2267: Yes Tinashe is interested in the medical field he wants to treat people as a doctor
28/02/24, 4:39 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Mr. Collen, Let me tell you that the requirements vary depending on the country Since Medical Education and Engineering are two aspects for which the Indian Education System is known, both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level: Physics, Chemistry, and Biology. If they want to study any Engineering Course, they should have Physics and Mathematics at their A level mandatorily.
28/02/24, 4:39 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Tinashe, Since you do not have Biology, I regret to inform you that you are not eligible for Medicine and Pharmacy, but considering your interest there are better courses from the Medical Field itself that you are eligible for and which can help fulfill your dreams of working in this field
*B.Sc. in Medical Laboratory Technology*
*Bachelor of Pharmacy(B.Pharm.)*
*BTech in Biomedical Engineering*
*B.Sc. in Nutrition and Dietetics*
Would you like me to explain any of these programs for you?
28/02/24, 5:00 pm - +263 77 375 2267: I have to confirm with Tinashe because l once heard  him talking about BTech in Biomedical Engineering  Sorry l have to come back to you
28/02/24, 5:02 pm - +263 77 375 2267: Yes you can explain to me about these programs
28/02/24, 5:03 pm - Pallika Edoofa: May I know which course you would like me to explain, please?
28/02/24, 5:06 pm - +263 77 375 2267: BTech in Biomedical Engineering
28/02/24, 7:00 pm - +263 78 450 4280: Hey hwu doing

02/03/24, 10:36 am - Pallika Edoofa: Good Morning,

*“If there is no struggle, there is no progress.” —Frederick Douglass*

On a positive note, I am here to begin our session
Are you ready?
02/03/24, 11:35 am - +263 78 450 4280: Yes I am ready
02/03/24, 11:36 am - +263 77 540 0964: Good morning
02/03/24, 11:36 am - +263 77 540 0964: Yes
02/03/24, 11:41 am - Pallika Edoofa: How are you both doing today?
02/03/24, 11:56 am - +263 77 540 0964: We are doing fine and you
02/03/24, 11:57 am - Pallika Edoofa: I am also doing well
02/03/24, 11:58 am - Pallika Edoofa: Let me brief you that, I want to brief you that the criteria before the pandemic was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is *a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.
02/03/24, 11:59 am - Pallika Edoofa: Based on my evaluation, considering your subjects, interests, and passion, you are eligible to pursue


​*B.Tech Civil Engineering*



Do you want me to explain the course in depth?
02/03/24, 11:59 am - +263 78 450 4280: Yes please
02/03/24, 11:59 am - Pallika Edoofa: *B.Tech Civil Engineering: What is it About?*

Civil engineering is one of the oldest engineering disciplines in the world. Civil engineering, until a few decades back, was a much sought after course among Indian students, but lately has been sidelined due to the software and IT boom. However with the increasing need to develop and maintain India’s infrastructure, which is lagging in all aspects, this field is bouncing back strongly.

There are options for higher studies after the completion of B.Tech. course. Students can pursue Master’s degree in specialized course. Master of Technology (M.Tech.) in Civil engineering and other allied branches like-

*Structural Engineering*
*Architectural Engineering*
*Geotechnical Engineering*
*Environmental Engineering etc.*

*B.Tech Civil Engineering: Who should opt?*

Before you decide to pursue your undergraduate studies in this field, it is important to understand that Civil engineering is not just about buildings and bridges. If you are under the assumption that all that civil engineers do is wear a yellow helmet and supervise workers in construction sites, then you are yet to understand the true capacity of this field. 


*Career aspects*

In these cases, you will have to hunt for a core engineering job all by yourself through off-campus placements. Creating strong professional networks, developing a great resume with stellar GPA and doing impressive projects and internships will help you secure a job in one of the core civil engineering companies.

Also, civil engineers find work not just in construction industry, but also in other industries such as oil and energy, transportation, petroleum, environmental, power and electric utilities, chemical etc where infrastructure projects and construction facilities are involved. Some students transition to software, consulting or banking as they feel that salary and growth prospects are better in these sectors.
02/03/24, 12:00 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *I hope that you are aiming for the same*
02/03/24, 12:02 pm - +263 78 450 4280: Yes indeed
02/03/24, 12:03 pm - +263 78 450 4280: What is Stella GPA
02/03/24, 12:05 pm - +263 77 375 2267: Good morning
02/03/24, 12:06 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Stella GPA in mechanical engineering is a term that likely refers to a specific grading system or metric used to evaluate academic performance in mechanical engineering courses. However, without more context or information, it's challenging to provide a precise explanation. It's possible that "Stella GPA" could be a reference to a particular university's grading scale or a specialized GPA calculation method used within a mechanical engineering program.
02/03/24, 12:06 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Welcome to the session, Mr. Collen,
How are you?

04/03/24, 1:40 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career. I believe you will be researching about the course in detail.
 
*Now, as you know, Edoofa Recommends India as a Higher Education Platform.*
May I know what is your knowledge or what have you researched about India and the Indian Education System?
04/03/24, 2:47 pm - +263 78 450 4280: Okay I have researced about the taj mahal
04/03/24, 2:49 pm - +263 78 450 4280: In addition about the Indian education ,I really like the way they treat science with all their heart mostly in medical and engineering fields
04/03/24, 2:51 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I am really glad to see your knowledge about India and the Indian Education System. It is good that you have started researching and familiarising yourself with the opportunities. Let me guide you further to give a better picture.

04/03/24, 2:51 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I am sure after seeing all these amazing facts, you will be intrigued to study in India.
04/03/24, 3:52 pm - +263 78 450 4280: Thank you very much
04/03/24, 4:00 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That is amazing, As I can see, you have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead.

*By any chance are you familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship?*
04/03/24, 4:10 pm - +263 78 450 4280: Not yet
04/03/24, 4:23 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That’s alright, Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India compared to other global hubs.

In India, international students face an average expense of *$6000-$8000 annually.* While this is very low as compared to the Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc where the cost of education ranges from $15000-$35000 annually, it is still beyond the reach of many.

With the Edoofa Scholarship Program, the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000 per annum* for the students who are found eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility Check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Laundry, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
04/03/24, 4:23 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
04/03/24, 4:23 pm - Pallika Edoofa: In simple words what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost $3000 or less a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well. 

However, as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even after this we allow the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.

*So do you feel the reduced cost of education is affordable to your family?*
04/03/24, 5:09 pm - +263 78 450 4280: Yes it can be affordable
04/03/24, 5:10 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Good to know, 
So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians. Looking at this cost of education as well, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits which can help in reducing their fees further.

Do you know how that is done?
04/03/24, 5:11 pm - +263 78 450 4280: Not yet please explain
04/03/24, 5:12 pm - +263 78 450 4280: That's a wonderful opportunity
04/03/24, 5:22 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That’s alright, Let me tell you how Edoofa helps Edoofians bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the *Earn While You Learn Program*

The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that are equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.The Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies and needs, converting an Individual into a market-ready professional. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
04/03/24, 5:22 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Projects with Brands and Companies: -*
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, such as:
*Africa Global Radio-* The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project and hear from the CEO about the exposures of the Edoofa program.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4DAP24ZuY4&authuser=0
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0
*Skooqs-* This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

*Recruitment Partners:-*
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

*Webinars:-*
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars regularly with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
-Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
-How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi
-How to be industry-ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu
-It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje
-Decoding the science of personal branding by Mr, Simon Maingi
04/03/24, 5:22 pm - Pallika Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field. These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.

*What are your views on the same? Do you think you will be benefiting from the Earn While You Learn Program?*
04/03/24, 5:27 pm - +263 78 450 4280: That's the goal right there 
the EWYL program is such a wonderful opportunity I would not like to lose .this will benefit me through the course
04/03/24, 9:34 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
04/03/24, 9:34 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Absolutely,
If I have to help you explain how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable compared to Local Universities, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now, if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, bringing the cost further down to $1000 per year including the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month. *This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*

*You can see this even in this scholarship credit certificate where one of our star performers, our Proud Edoodians  Masinire Miriam earned $1965 within a year.* I hope you can now realize the power of the EWYL program to reduce the financial pressure on families.
04/03/24, 10:03 pm - +263 78 450 4280: Yes I can see it it's impressive
