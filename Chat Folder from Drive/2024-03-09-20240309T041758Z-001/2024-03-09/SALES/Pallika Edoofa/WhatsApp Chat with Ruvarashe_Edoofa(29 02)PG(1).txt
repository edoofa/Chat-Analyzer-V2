She did her O and A level at Marange high school in Manicaland Province attaining 5As 5Bs and a D at O level. She has 3 A level passes, an A in Food Science, C in Biology and a E in Chemistry level.Her tuition was catered for by her father at $390 US dollars per term until she concluded her studies in 2022. Ruvarashe is on the quiet side especially in new  people but opens up among friends. She has a never back down spirit coupled with a good sense of humour. Her written and spoken English reflect an understanding and fluency of her prowess. She is able to articulate herself on issues, very good reader with a broad knowledge on various issues. A self confessed Chef, her cooking and baking in  is excellent, her novel writing a welcome distraction for the few of us who know of it. Ruvarashe is shy and a bit reserved among strangers, has a keen sense of imagination,  is very artistic and Intelligent. Undoubtedly partial to sport her role ends on the spectator side.Ruvarashe intends to study food technology so she can gain the knowledge and establish a reputable food company that caters to the public with special emphasis on healthy eating.
Her role as she sees it is to be able to contribute significantly to the food culture as she terms it. Her desire to indulge in Food Technology springs from her love of cuisines from a tender age watching food network and practically repeating the recipes with her own twist. My place of residence is in Mashonaland Central Province

05/03/24, 10:38 am - Pallika Edoofa: Ms. Chipo, I do understand the challenges, did you manage to compare the cost of education in Zimbabwe with that through the Edoofa Scholarship Program?
05/03/24, 10:38 am - Pallika Edoofa: You see, Our Senior Academician was in Zimbabwe for 4 months last year and let me highlight the importance of this opportunity for Zimbabwean students. I want you to think about this situation, where you are studying at UZ. The Tuition fee at UZ ranges from $1000-$1200 per annum with hikes most of the years. The living expenses in Zimbabwe are much more costly than in India. Even the staple diet sadza costs $1 per meal. So you have to spend around $3 per or more per day for meals. A taxi ride for a short distance costs $1, Wi-Fi costs $120 per month, the living rents are high with hikes and the unemployment rates are increasing. Many students work at petrol pumps, markets, selling SIM cards etc after graduation. You might have observed this. All in all, students studying in Zimbabwe have informed us they have to meet an expense of about $3000 or more per annum.
05/03/24, 10:38 am - Pallika Edoofa: At the same time, Edoofians are studying here in India at a cost much less than that of Zimbabwe and even self-sponsoring their education through the Earn While You Learn Program. We also ensure they develop employability skills so that they are job-ready by the time they graduate. I believe you are looking forward to such an opportunity for your child’s career, aren't you?
05/03/24, 10:48 am - +263 77 872 8181: It's true bt with all these challenges ,my daughter is the only girl l have after her younger sister passed on, surely l need an education for her bt right now l donot afford that,she will be faraway with nothing for her upkeep and other expenses,l don't want a situation whereby she would be forced into totally uncalled-for behavior  so that she can sponsor her education.
05/03/24, 10:51 am - Pallika Edoofa: I understand your concern, Ms. Chipo. It's undoubtedly a challenging situation, particularly when considering the well-being and future of your daughter. However, it's essential to remember that there are avenues available that can alleviate some of these concerns.

One such avenue is through programs like the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) program, which enables students to manage their expenses while pursuing their education. Additionally, once your daughter becomes eligible, she might have the opportunity to self-finance her education through scholarships, grants, or part-time work.

While the financial aspect is undoubtedly crucial, it's also essential to provide emotional support and guidance to your daughter during this time. Encouraging her to explore her interests and pursue her passions can ultimately lead to a fulfilling and successful future.

Please know that there are resources and support systems available to help navigate these challenges, and together, we can work towards ensuring a bright and prosperous future for your daughter.
05/03/24, 10:57 am - Pallika Edoofa: Ms. Chipo, in our program, we've got a fantastic group of students who all share similar backgrounds. Despite the challenges they face, they're not letting anything hold them back. They're stepping up, driven by a desire to make a real difference in their lives. And let me tell you, they're putting in the effort like you wouldn't believe!

Now, let's talk about the reality in your hometown. It's tough out there, right? Many teens and adults are struggling to find decent employment, or even jobs that match their skills. But here's the thing: we're here to change that narrative.

We're committed to ensuring our students have the tools and opportunities they need to build a brighter, more promising future for themselves. We're talking about empowering them to seize those opportunities and excel in their chosen fields. With our support, they're not just dreaming of a better tomorrow – they're making it happen.

So, if you're looking for a program that's truly invested in your success, look no further. Together, we'll pave the way to a better, more employable future right here in India.
05/03/24, 11:00 am - +263 77 872 8181: Well said,l appreciate that, when is the next group coming to India?
05/03/24, 11:11 am - Pallika Edoofa: Ms. Chipo, please note that Ruvarashe is eligible to come in the intake of August 2024.
05/03/24, 11:23 am - +263 77 872 8181: Ok ,do you finance their tickets?hw much is the ticket if you don't finance?
05/03/24, 11:29 am - Pallika Edoofa: See, Ms. Chipo, If you understand the concept of international education finances that play a major role are not visa fees and flight tickets. The flight ticket is required a very limited number of times as the students don't travel that often. I don't mean to say that students can not go back to their country, they can definitely go back to enjoy the holidays. What I have personally seen is, the students do not travel that often.

So, considering the main finance which plays the most important role in international education is the annual fees. So, to reduce this annual fee, Edoofa helps a student with the Earn While You Learn Program. This program provides the students with an opportunity to earn scholarship credits which in return help them to make their education more affordable.

Visa fees and flight tickets are to be bought just a month before they plan to come to India. So, let's say the student wants to come to India in August 2024, This means that his family has to cater the Visa fee and the ticket in July 2024. If you understand the concept properly, till July 2024, the student will be working in the Earn While You Learn program and will be earning Scholarship credits. Now, with this opportunity, you can save a lot of money on the annual fee which in return helps you to make your flight ticket and the Visa fee affordable.

As mentioned to you already, the scholarship covers the tuition fees as you see, the Edoofa scholarship is basically the scholarship seats acquired from the universities for their good work in the past 14 years in the higher education space. So the travel costs will have to be covered by the student, But our admission team assist you in all the steps. So that you get the cheapest air travel tickets and also easily acquire the visa.

The cost of the visa is $83 for the entire course, and the flight cost will be around $400 to $500. But you need not worry about that yet as you will be coming to India in the month of July-August and till them the team would be helping you with your preparations.
05/03/24, 11:36 am - +263 77 872 8181: When will she start working in the EWYL program?
05/03/24, 11:40 am - Pallika Edoofa: Ms. Chipo, Let me help you out here as once we will end our today's session, then Ruvarashe's application will be proceeded towards the Stage 2 and after the further discussion, Ruvarashe's application will be forwarded for the eligibility check test and the interview and once found eligibile, right, away her EWYL Process as well as Admission Process will be started before coming to India

05/03/24, 2:30 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Based on my evaluation, considering your subjects, interests, and passion, you are eligible to pursue


*B.Sc. in Nutrition and Dietetics*


Do you want me to explain the course in depth?
05/03/24, 2:31 pm - +263 77 872 8181: Yes, explain it please
05/03/24, 2:31 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright!
05/03/24, 2:31 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *B.Sc. in Nutrition and Dietetics* is a 3- year long full- time undergraduate course divided over 6 semesters. It involves the study of food management, promotion of health through healthy food, and primarily focusses on the relationship between the body and food.
B.Sc. in Nutrition and Dietetics essentially involves an advanced learning in ways to enhance the quality of life and overall well-being by promoting healthy diet behaviors and exploring healthier dietary modifications.

The program consists of a comprehensive curriculum that combines the science of nutrition with a broader view of wellness, community and environment, delving into reasons for unhealthy eating behaviors and ways to rectify and improve the same.

Students interested in learning about nutritional matters and food habits, and in training in health care units such as clinics, hospitals and community nutrition in close proximity of doctors, clinicians and dieticians, are best suited for a B.Sc. in Nutrition & Dietetics.

Ideal candidates would have relevant skills such as tact, team spirit and compassion, and an inherent instinct to counsel, guide, and treat patients suffering from diet- based health issues.

Nutrition and Dietetics is fast- growing both as an academic discipline and in practical application, both in India and abroad. Successful graduates of the course interested in further studies in the discipline may pursue M.Sc., M.Phil. and Ph. D in the same subject. Those interested in professionally working in the industry and find lucrative employment opportunities in private sector clinics and hospitals, or may get self-employed.

Other areas of employment include private sector organizations such as leisure cruise companies and private nursing homes. Such graduates may also choose to become psychiatric nursing as a profession where they work with patients suffering from emotional and psychological distress caused from unhealthy diet patterns.
05/03/24, 2:31 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *I hope this course aligns with what you are aiming for*
05/03/24, 2:34 pm - +263 77 872 8181: Sure

05/03/24, 2:44 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Also,  I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career. I believe you will be researching about the course in detail.

05/03/24, 2:55 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I am sure after seeing all these amazing facts, you will be intrigued to study in India.
05/03/24, 2:59 pm - +263 77 872 8181: Surely l d love my child to study in lndia,thank you very much for delvin deeper into the education system .
05/03/24, 3:00 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That is amazing, As I can see, you have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead.

*By any chance are you familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship?*
05/03/24, 3:06 pm - +263 77 872 8181: Am unfamiliar with the charges
05/03/24, 3:07 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That’s alright, Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India compared to other global hubs.

In India, international students face an average expense of *$6000-$8000 annually.* While this is very low as compared to the Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc where the cost of education ranges from $15000-$35000 annually, it is still beyond the reach of many.

With the Edoofa Scholarship Program, the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000 per annum* for the students who are found eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility Check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Laundry, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
05/03/24, 3:07 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
05/03/24, 3:13 pm - +263 77 872 8181: Pallika as l told you before my husband is unemployed,l thought you said my daughter will finance her education through credits earned  in EWYL.
05/03/24, 3:14 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I know and understand,
So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians. Looking at this cost of education as well, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits which can help in reducing their fees further.

Do you know how that is done?
05/03/24, 3:16 pm - +263 77 872 8181: By earning while you learn,is that so?
05/03/24, 3:16 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Yes!
05/03/24, 3:16 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That’s alright, Let me tell you how Edoofa helps Edoofians bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the *Earn While You Learn Program*

The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that are equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.The Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies and needs, converting an Individual into a market-ready professional. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
05/03/24, 3:16 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Projects with Brands and Companies: -*
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, such as:
*Africa Global Radio-* The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project and hear from the CEO about the exposures of the Edoofa program.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4DAP24ZuY4&authuser=0
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0
*Skooqs-* This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

*Recruitment Partners:-*
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

*Webinars:-*
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars regularly with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
-Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
-How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi
-How to be industry-ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu
-It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje
-Decoding the science of personal branding by Mr, Simon Maingi
05/03/24, 3:16 pm - Pallika Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field. These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.

*What are your views on the same? Do you think you will be benefiting from the Earn While You Learn Program?*
05/03/24, 3:23 pm - +263 77 872 8181: It is highly recommended that she goes into EWYL program,lt will be of much benefit to enhance her chances of study,lt would also mould her into imployable material
05/03/24, 3:24 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
05/03/24, 3:24 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Absolutely,
If I have to help you explain how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable compared to Local Universities, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now, if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, bringing the cost further down to $1000 per year including the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month. *This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*

*You can see this even in this scholarship credit certificate where one of our star performers, our Proud Edoodians  Masinire Miriam earned $1965 within a year.* I hope you can now realize the power of the EWYL program to reduce the financial pressure on families.
05/03/24, 3:27 pm - +263 77 872 8181: EWYL is a very flexible program and can assist our child to being a high achiever
05/03/24, 3:27 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Great, Now, as we are proceeding towards the end, let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, a few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :

*1. Expert Career Counselling:* We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counsellors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.

*2. Affordability through guaranteed scholarships:* Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off.

*3. Earn While You Learn:* The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing our students for the real world. 

*4.Higher Education Concierge:* A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.*

After going through these facts that make Edoofa different, which one out of the 4 did you feel is the most significant?
05/03/24, 3:30 pm - +263 77 872 8181: Number 4
05/03/24, 3:30 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Great! 
So now I know you focus more on quality education, services and guidance
Let me also show you some monthly earnings of students through Earn While You Learn.

05/03/24, 3:31 pm - Pallika Edoofa: As you see, there is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it depends upon his/her hard work. However, I hope that you will be able to manage the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
05/03/24, 3:33 pm - +263 77 872 8181: We will try ,if it's a small amount  since my husband is out of work.
05/03/24, 3:34 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright! I believe you'll be discussing everything with your family after we complete today's session. Also, after our counselling session, I would connect to some of our beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know their experiences and proceedings well.

May I know how you feel about your child studying abroad?
05/03/24, 3:36 pm - +263 77 872 8181: It will be a wonderful experience for her.lt will also expose her in preparedness for her future employment
05/03/24, 3:37 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, as studying Internationally would make your child's career advance at an even greater pace, as your child  will be transformed into a professional with a well-paying job, which would help your child in uplifting your family there by yourself, and provide a peaceful and hassle-free life to your parents.
05/03/24, 3:37 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *As we move to the last part of the session, let me highlight a few requirements while a student applies alone* 

*1) Application Form* -An online or offline form that asks for your personal details and academic background.

*2) Statement of Purpose-* An essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and your aspirations for your career.

*3) Letter of Recommendation-* from Senior authorities, School Heads or others on why they recommend you to be a right fit for an international university.
Do you know about other requirements?
05/03/24, 3:39 pm - +263 77 872 8181: I feel that's all you have asked for
05/03/24, 3:40 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Great, When a student applies alone for an international University, on average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose costs between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally and act as a major parameter to decide the child’s eligibility. If you apply to 5 Universities, the average costs for the mentioned would be $1350-$1750, *without even receiving a guarantee to be selected*

*Edoofa has identified a solution for this uncertainty and unaffordability.* If a student qualifies after the eligibility check, not only does Edoofa help them draft their statement of purpose but also helps in terms of Visa Documentation Assistance, University Session and selection, Individual mentorship, etc, reducing the costs significantly to $750 which is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
05/03/24, 3:40 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
05/03/24, 3:42 pm - +263 77 872 8181: Alright thanks very much
05/03/24, 3:43 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Please note The enrollment fee is to be paid only if a child is found eligible for the Edoofa Scholarship Program after passing the eligibility check stage, it includes, 

*Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
*Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
*Earn While You Learn Program and training*
*University sessions and selection*
*A guaranteed scholarship seat*
*Visa Documentation Assistance*
*The Foster and Care throughout the course of an Edoofian*
05/03/24, 3:43 pm - Pallika Edoofa: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge due to which parents might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short period of 7 days and for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option wherein if the student is found eligible, instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, *parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days thereby reducing the financial pressure.*
05/03/24, 3:45 pm - +263 77 872 8181: Will do our best in trying to pay up if she secures a place
05/03/24, 3:45 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
05/03/24, 3:47 pm - +263 77 872 8181: We are on 2
05/03/24, 3:49 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Well,
We also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.

*Step 1:Connect with a counsellor-* As your counsellor, now we are going through the counselling process discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Edoofa Scholarship.                        

*Step 2:Eligibility Check-* The eligibility check includes the interviews with the Academic Board and Scholarship Test.

*Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa-* If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter.

*Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program-* This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.

We are left with steps 5 and 6.
So shall I explain them to you?
05/03/24, 3:51 pm - +263 77 872 8181: Yes
05/03/24, 3:52 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright!
05/03/24, 3:52 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 5:* After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors. They will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. will be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by paying the registration fee within a few weeks.

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education and the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).
05/03/24, 3:52 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 6:* Once you are done with the registration fee payment, you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.
 
I hope you are clear with the process.

05/03/24, 4:04 pm - Pallika Edoofa: So, Ms. Chipo, we have come to the end of your counselling session. Before I guide you Step 2 of the Eligibility Check, I want you to have a full-fledged discussion of the Edoofa program within your family as higher education is supposed to be a family decision.

06/03/24, 10:42 am - Pallika Edoofa: Greetings Ruvarashe, and Dear Parents

Congratulations on clearing stage 1 of the Edoofa Program I hope you have learned about the program better through the previous sessions. Now, I will guide you to the most important *Eligibility check stage* after addressing your questions. 

Are you ready for the same?
06/03/24, 10:51 am - +263 77 872 8181: Yes
06/03/24, 11:03 am - Pallika Edoofa: It is good to connect with you today, Ms. Chipo
I hope you are doing well
06/03/24, 11:03 am - Pallika Edoofa: I believe you have been following the sessions on the group regarding the program. What are your thoughts on the Edoofa Scholarship Program and do you have any questions for me, please?
06/03/24, 11:04 am - +263 77 872 8181: It's a great program catering for the financially incapable
06/03/24, 11:29 am - Pallika Edoofa: I am glad you understand this opportunity's importance and the power to transform your child's career!
06/03/24, 11:29 am - Pallika Edoofa: That is fine, 

May I know the thoughts and opinions of your family regarding the financial aspects such as enrollment fees and cost of education, please
06/03/24, 11:50 am - +263 77 872 8181: They got no problem with it
06/03/24, 12:19 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I appreciate your willingness to invest in your child’s career
06/03/24, 12:19 pm - Pallika Edoofa: So, As you know, A-level students are currently occupied with lessons and exam preparations due to which they are unavailable now. When you compare this with the Western African Countries students will be available with results much earlier than Zimbabweans, and there is a high chance that the scholarship seats would be occupied by them which in turn would be a loss for Zimbabwean students. At the same time, the day scholars in Zimbabwe are still applying and clearing the tests. 

All these factors have been a disadvantage for the boarding students and specifically the students who aren't supposed to use their devices in School. By the time they are back, the opportunity might be vacated by other applicants. This is the reason why our Academic Board along with the discussion with Universities has decided to allow parents to take part in the seat reservation interview for their children so that no deserving applicant is missed out. 

*So are you willing to take up the Seat Reservation Interview call for Ruvarashe?*
06/03/24, 12:50 pm - +263 77 872 8181: Ruvarashe actually finished her A level back in 2022
06/03/24, 12:53 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Oh, Kindly excuse this, Ms. Chipo, as this message is for another applicant whose name if Ruvarashe!
06/03/24, 12:54 pm - Pallika Edoofa: So, May I knoe if she is available now?
06/03/24, 12:55 pm - +263 77 872 8181: She's available but she's in Manicaland Province
06/03/24, 1:29 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's alright!
06/03/24, 1:30 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Ruvarashe, Before we move to the Eligibility Procedures, can you tell me?

1. What is the name of the course that you would be studying through the Edoofa Program?

2. In which country will you be studying through the Edoofa program?

3. What is the average cost of studies in India without a scholarship?

4. What is the annual fee you will pay if found eligible for the program?

5. What is the enrollment fee of the Edoofa Program and in how many days is it paid if you are found eligible?

6. Please elaborate on your understanding of the Earn While You Learn program in 75-100 words.

7. After receiving your offer letter from the University, you will have to pay your registration fee to finalize your university selection and reserve your scholarship seat in a particular university, this registration fee will be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?
06/03/24, 1:48 pm - +263 77 872 8181: Am working on this Pallika,l'l come back to you when am done
06/03/24, 2:10 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright!
06/03/24, 3:55 pm - +263 77 872 8181: May l get in touch with you tomorrow  ,my phone had gone off.
06/03/24, 3:59 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Ms. Chipo, I will wait for your response
07/03/24, 9:05 am - +263 77 872 8181: 1. Bsc in Nutrition and Dietetics  
2. India
3. 6000 to 8000 us dollars a year
4. 2000 to 3000 us dollars per year
5. 200 dollars paid in seven days and 150 dollars to be paid in 30 days
6. EWYL means Earn While you Learn it makes higher education affordable to less privileged as compared to local Universities. If one manages to earn scholarship credit through EWYL then the credit cost for the year will be brought down. Expenses covered by EWYL include tuition, food and accomodation. There is no limit to the credit a student can attain so long they are willing to work hard. A student is given a certificate to show the credits acquired. It eases the family's financial burden. For example if a child earns $150 per month the scholarship credit for one year will be $1800
7. Yes
07/03/24, 9:28 am - Pallika Edoofa: Greetings Ms. Chipo,
How are you?
07/03/24, 9:29 am - Pallika Edoofa: Thank you for sharing this!
07/03/24, 9:30 am - Pallika Edoofa: @263778728181 you see as per my experience over the last couple of years, I have been fortunate to have assisted over hundreds of students in achieving their career aspiration through the Edoofa Program. 

One of my key observations during helping out these students was regarding what was the common trait amongst students who are today having the best of their time in India through the Edoofa Program, and honestly I was able to come down to only one aspect that is FAMILY SUPPORT.
07/03/24, 9:30 am - Pallika Edoofa: You see in this journey of any child's higher education, there are three major contributors 

1. Student himself/herself
2. FAMILY
3. EDOOFA PROGAM

Now all the students who are today successfully a part of the Edoofa Program, had all these three contributors working together towards the common goal which is student's success and ensuring that by the time student completes his/her higher education they should be able to get good paying jobs. 

Even if any one of the contributor does not perform to the best of their abilities, Student's overall success is hampered. Let me give you a few examples

*In the event if student wishes to work hard, Edoofa is willing to support but the Family is not willing to support, the student will not be successful under the program*

*In the event if student wishes to work hard, Family is willing to support, but Edoofa's academic Board doesn't find the student worthy, the student will not be successful under the program*

*In the event if Family is willing to support, Edoofa's Academic Board is willing to support but the student doesn't wishes to work hard, then also the student will not be successful under the program*
07/03/24, 9:30 am - Pallika Edoofa: During the evaluation of your child's application so far, the Academic Board has evaluated a few aspects, such as student's willingness to work hard, and family's willingness to support the student so that the student can achieve what he/she has aspired. However now in your interview ahead, the Academic Board would be strictly be evaluating the Family's support towards the child higher education. 

*As you know in the event if your child is found eligible, you would have to complete a certain part of the formalities within the 7 day timeline, so may I know regarding the same, are you willing to support your child to the fullest?*


Please address this using voice notes!
07/03/24, 9:35 am - +263 77 872 8181: <Media omitted>
07/03/24, 9:36 am - +263 77 872 8181: Am alright and you?
07/03/24, 9:46 am - Pallika Edoofa: Thank you for sharing this, Ms. Chipo, I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
07/03/24, 9:46 am - Pallika Edoofa: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
07/03/24, 9:46 am - Pallika Edoofa: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below
07/03/24, 9:46 am - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
07/03/24, 9:47 am - Pallika Edoofa: I hope now you know Ideally, the tentative dates:

1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 14th or 15th of March 2024 for $200 and the 14th or 15th  of April for the remaining $150.

2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 14th or 15th  of March 2024

Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?
07/03/24, 9:50 am - +263 77 872 8181: <Media omitted>
07/03/24, 9:53 am - Pallika Edoofa: Ms. Chipo, I didn't get that, Please can you send that again!
07/03/24, 9:54 am - +263 77 872 8181: <Media omitted>
07/03/24, 10:00 am - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
07/03/24, 10:14 am - +263 77 872 8181: The first option is the best for me
07/03/24, 10:15 am - +263 77 872 8181: <Media omitted>
07/03/24, 10:56 am - Pallika Edoofa: That's alright!
07/03/24, 10:56 am - Pallika Edoofa: So, are you comfortable with the dates?
07/03/24, 10:56 am - +263 77 872 8181: Can the dates be changed
07/03/24, 10:57 am - Pallika Edoofa: May I know what is the concern please?
07/03/24, 10:58 am - +263 77 872 8181: I can only get money at the end of the month
07/03/24, 11:17 am - Pallika Edoofa: Ms. Chipo, I understand that, If I can make a request on your behalf, At Edoofa, we have ensured to reward deserving students with the best possible opportunities. There are 370+ Edoofians just from Zimbabwe who arrived in India last year and they are not all from great backgrounds, there have been struggles and sacrifices behind the journey of each Edoofian considering the long-term vision. At the same time, we need to be fair with all applicants and we are experiencing a surge in the number of applications with limited scholarship seats. Therefore, it would be challenging to hold the application of your child for long. But considering your plan for your child's career and strong passion towards the program, if I request our Academic Board for a payment plan in such a way that you can pay $100 in 7 days, $100 by the 26th of March if your child qualifies, will it be feasible for you?
07/03/24, 11:41 am - +263 77 872 8181: Yes Pallika,thank you very much for understanding my situation.
07/03/24, 12:15 pm - Pallika Edoofa: So, are you comfortable with this timeline, I hope that you will manage the fees at the respective dates!
07/03/24, 12:16 pm - Pallika Edoofa: So, shall I schedule an interview for you?
07/03/24, 12:17 pm - +263 77 872 8181: Yes
