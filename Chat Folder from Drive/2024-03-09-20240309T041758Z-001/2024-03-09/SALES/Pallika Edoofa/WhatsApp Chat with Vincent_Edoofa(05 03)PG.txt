06/03/24, 1:57 pm - +263 78 457 8207: Okay so to start 
My name is  Vincent Tanatswa Mukanwa.
I’m a very ambitious boy aged 19 years but with ambitions that go beyond my mere 19 years 
For my strengths I have a very long attention span thus I can give my undivided attention to anything required of me, I’m a critical but practical thinker thus I take a more practical approach to all presented problems, I’m also very good a following directions to the latter and on most things I’m a man who respect my time thus I’m always punctual 
But like everyone with their strength I have my weaknesses as I am quite the perfectionist that I don’t leave a task until I have made sure it perfect to my standards. I’m also a little slow in coming up with solutions to a problem as I’m always analyzing each solution as I come up with it before acting on it 
For my hobbies I like reading novels, playing chess, watching nature and studying anything to do with the human mind.
06/03/24, 2:13 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Please address the other questions too
06/03/24, 2:18 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Please excuse me for some time as I am heading for my lunch. Let us connect at 03:15 pm CAT for the next part of our session. Let me know if you have any challenges with the schedule.

Shall we continue?
06/03/24, 4:37 pm - +263 78 457 8207: I come from a family of four being the second born. My father hasn’t really been in the picture since I was 7 so that left my mother to single handedly fend for the family and made sure to send all of us to school 
I learnt at chindunduma 1 high in madziva from form 1 to 6 that is from 2018 to when I finished my form 6 in 2023 
For my A level I took Mathematics, physics and chemistry 
I would very much like to pursue medicine as it was a childhood dream not only to become a doctor but go further and study the complexities of the human mind to become a neurosurgeon.
My mother is a teacher who attained her deploma from Seke teachers college.
My older brother is goes to Harare polytechnic where he is doing quantity surveying, my little brother is in form 1 and my little sister is in grade 1
My mother has been financing my education and will continue to do so if I go abroad 
I come from mashonaland central And I learnt at Chindunduma 1 high where the fees is $450 a term 
I completed my A level in the year 2023
06/03/24, 8:42 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Thank you for sharing in detail, I am glad to hear and learn more about you. I am delighted that you expressed yourself genuinely. It is good to see that you are from Mashonaland central which is close to Harare, so I would like to share that Harare is very close to us as our founders hosted Education summits last year as well as this year. We are associated with many schools in Harare, some of them are the Nation's best schools, including *St. Dominic’s Chishawasha, Dominican Convent High, Christ Ministries, Mablereigh Girls High, St Ignatius, St John's, Harare High, Advent Hope Academy etc*

07/03/24, 10:22 am - Pallika Edoofa: I would like to know that if he is interested in Medicine, so why haven't he opted Biology in A level?
07/03/24, 10:23 am - +263 77 564 4625: Because of the competition here in zim they enrol most those with physics than biology
07/03/24, 10:45 am - Pallika Edoofa: Mrs. Musvosvi, Let me tell you that the requirements vary depending on the country Since Medical Education and Engineering are two aspects for which the Indian Education System is known, both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level: Physics, Chemistry, and Biology. If they want to study any Engineering Course, they should have Physics and Mathematics at their A level mandatorily.
07/03/24, 10:46 am - Pallika Edoofa: Since your child does not have Biology, I regret to inform you that he is not eligible for Medicine and Pharmacy, but considering your interest there are better courses from the Medical Field itself that you are eligible for and which can help fulfill your dreams of working in this field
*B.Sc. in Medical Laboratory Technology*
*Bachelor of Pharmacy(B.Pharm.)*
*BTech in Biomedical Engineering*
*B.Sc. in Nutrition and Dietetics*
Would you like me to explain any of these programs for you?
