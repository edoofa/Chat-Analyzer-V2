This ensures that you follow the sessions, comprehend the program thoroughly, and pose any questions that arise. Given that higher education is a significant decision requiring family support. If they are currently unavailable, they can still join the group and catch up on the conversations later.

Do you want me to explain the course in depth?
07/03/24, 3:48 pm - +27 63 427 2451: I have an idea thanks
07/03/24, 3:49 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Please address this

07/03/24, 3:55 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Sure
07/03/24, 3:55 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Bachelor of Design [B.Des]* in Communication Design is a 4-year full time undergraduate course. The programme is divided into 8 semesters of six months each.

Graphic Design is a specialised branch of communication design, and candidates wishing to specialise in this need to start out with a degree in communication design, which would allow them to specialise in graphic design after second year.
The course is best suited for those who are interested in seeking a career in anything from marketing companies to government agencies.

Having a bachelors in communication design opens the gateway to being a graphic artist, merchandiser, creative director or website designer. One may work in industries including media, public relations, communications, education and business.

Projects in this line of work include customized web-design for various merchandisers, creating advertisements for small businesses, developing magazine layouts or graphic designing for video games among other things. Some standard skills required for the aforementioned careers include creativity, knowledge of design techniques, familiarity with various multimedia and other relevant technical skills. Any design course fundamentally caters to those creatively inclined and left-brain oriented, equipping them with the necessary skills to make a career out of essentially thinking outside the box.

*What is it about?*

The program has been designed to offer the eligible students a course that concentrates on the conceptualisation, ‘design’, and execution of an idea. It can range from an advertisement to a movie, anything at all which needs to be graphically designed, the technology and software’s associated with it. The study of the course includes subjects like typography, colour theory, and layout theory. A B.Des degree in Graphic introduces a student to the industry of graphic design, understanding its history and its future, and to the technology and equipment required to design something. It focuses on the principles of design such as balance, contrast, movement and rhythm, etc., on typography, creating images for web and print, editing images, and ultimately leadership skills required to lead a team with your idea in this industry.  

This line of design is growing relevance in contemporary times. Everything today from education to markets of all types have now gained either a secondary digital presence, or operate solely in the digital space. Not only has digitization allowed producers to find wider markets but also allowed niche producers to find consumers that fit their specific demographic. Digitisation has eliminated, in various cases, costs associated with commute and thus made web-designing and digital branding critical to commerce today. Thus graduates in graphic design definitely are fit for the current ‘virtual market’ age. In fact, they have become quite indispensable in almost all industries today.

To sustain in this field one must be equipped with exceptional analytical skills and consumer insight to cater designs to consumer sensibility as well as the client’s brand image. Their artistic ability must undoubtedly be of a high grade and they should have the computer skills to translate their art into a graphic design, with a strong sense of creativity. They must be able communicators so they can understand the client’s needs and communicate his or her vision, as well as be good at time management since in this field an employee is required to work on multiple projects at the same time.

*Career Prospects*

Bachelors of Design in Communication Design graduates may have job opportunities both in the private and the government sector due to changing nature of the economy in this digital age. Today everything is seen through a web interface, exists solely on a web interface, or expands through a web interface. Furthermore, advertising campaigns and branding have become exceedingly digitized and much more intricate in design. Thus graduates in this course have a plethora of job opportunities on offer. Manufacturing units, marketing agencies, fashion media, boutiques, hotels, etc. are examples of the various private sector enterprises that hire graphic design graduates.
Job profiles for both these sectors includes graphic designers that are concerned with the conceptualization, sketching, and creation of designs keeping in mind the needs of the clients and consumer susceptibility. Similarly Web designers are occupied with the creation of websites, and more specialized job profiles in this field include interaction designers, communications designers, service designers, and etc.  

The market today is perfect for a graphic design graduate considering their need across multiple industries. Most business and enterprises today, as well as government agencies require designers in order to make them accessible in this age of marketing and digitization.

*Now, as you know, Edoofa Recommends India as a Higher Education Platform.*
May I know what is your knowledge or what have you researched about India and the Indian Education System?
08/03/24, 12:28 pm - +27 63 427 2451: India has a diverse education system that includes both public and private schools and universities. The education system in India is overseen by the Ministry of Education, and it is divided into different levels, including primary education, secondary education, and tertiary education. India has a large number of universities and colleges offering various courses in different fields, including engineering, medicine, humanities, and social sciences. Additionally, Indian education culture emphasizes the importance of rote learning, memorization, and academic excellence.
08/03/24, 12:30 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Ashleigh, India indeed boasts a diverse education system overseen by the Ministry of Education, encompassing primary, secondary, and tertiary levels. Its numerous universities and colleges offer a wide array of courses spanning engineering, medicine, humanities, and social sciences. Notably, India's education culture emphasizes rote learning, memorization, and academic prowess.
08/03/24, 12:30 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Also, That is amazing, As I can see, you have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead.

*By any chance are you familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship?*
08/03/24, 12:37 pm - +27 63 427 2451: I might not be familiar but I can definitely help with that. To estimate the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship, I can consider factors such as tuition fees, living expenses, and other related costs. Tuition fees for international students can vary widely depending on the country and specific institution. Additionally, living expenses such as accommodation, food, transportation, and other personal costs should also be taken into account. It's important to research specific universities and their respective cost estimates to obtain a more accurate picture of the total expenses involved.
08/03/24, 12:41 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That’s alright, Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India compared to other global hubs.

In India, international students face an average expense of *$6000-$8000 annually.* While this is very low as compared to the Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc where the cost of education ranges from $15000-$35000 annually, it is still beyond the reach of many.

With the Edoofa Scholarship Program, the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000 per annum* for the students who are found eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility Check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Laundry, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
08/03/24, 12:42 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
08/03/24, 2:04 pm - +27 63 427 2451: Yes I believe so
08/03/24, 2:47 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Kindly excuse the delay as I was having my lunch.
08/03/24, 2:47 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Good to know, 
So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians. Looking at this cost of education as well, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits which can help in reducing their fees further.

Do you know how that is done?
08/03/24, 3:03 pm - +27 63 427 2451: I don't think I know, please explain further
08/03/24, 3:04 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That’s alright, Let me tell you how Edoofa helps Edoofians bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the *Earn While You Learn Program*

The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that are equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.The Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies and needs, converting an Individual into a market-ready professional. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
08/03/24, 3:04 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Projects with Brands and Companies: -*
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, such as:
*Africa Global Radio-* The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market.

08/03/24, 3:04 pm - Pallika Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field. These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.
