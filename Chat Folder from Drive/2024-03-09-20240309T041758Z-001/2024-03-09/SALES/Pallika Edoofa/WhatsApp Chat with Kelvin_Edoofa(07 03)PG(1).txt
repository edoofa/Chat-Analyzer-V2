May I know if have you been informed about the Edoofa Scholarship Program or its details?

07/03/24, 12:21 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's alright, Let me share some information with you!
07/03/24, 12:21 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *The Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4000 students from different African countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
07/03/24, 12:21 pm - Pallika Edoofa: This message was deleted
07/03/24, 12:22 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program. We are associated with more than 200 schools in Zimbabwe with some of the most elite schools. In Harare, we collaborate with *St. Dominic’s Chishawasha, Dominican Convent High, Christ Ministries, Harare High, Mablereigh Girls High, St Ignatius, St John’s* and many others. To name a few from *Manicaland, St. David’s Girls Bonda, Hartzell High, First Class Academy, Chibuwe High, Nagle House* and so on with the children of the DEOs of Chipinge and Mutare having their children under the Edoofa Scholarship. Masvingo has 24 Schools that collaborated with over 300 students from some of the best schools such as *Pamushana, St. Antony’s, Reformed Church Gutu, Dewure High, Chiredzi High* and many others. The program is also appreciated by the Education Inspector of Bikita- Madam Makomeke. We have more than 500 students from Mashonaland (West, Central and East) Province, *Midlands Province(Fletcher, Regina Mundi, etc). Mathebeland(North, South) we have St Mark’s, Usher High, Plumtree, Sizane High etc.* Our collaborations with the UCE College Bulawayo add a feather to the Cap of trust that Edoofa has built in 14 years. 

The Schools, Institutions and Educationists who have made efforts to train the students for this prestigious Scholarship Program are also the Authorized Dignitaries of EDOOFA in Zimbabwe. *We have Mr. Shorwi Kawadza (Retd. Headmaster Hartzell), Mr. Charles Jerera (Retd. Ministry of Education), Mrs. Christina Rockson (Founder and Principal of Hilltop Christian College in SA)* who have shown relentless efforts to guide students on the right path to success.EDOOFA boasts a proud students and parents community of more than 2500+ Zimbabweans who are happy with the quality of education and the employability outcomes.

*I believe you are looking forward to such an opportunity for your child's career, aren't you?*
07/03/24, 12:27 pm - +27 63 712 0686: That's very interesting.
07/03/24, 12:27 pm - +27 63 712 0686: So what's the requirements and procedures needed
07/03/24, 12:28 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Could you shed some light on what kind of student you feel your child is, what are your child's strengths and weaknesses and how would you describe Kelvin as a person, please?

Please include these aspects of your child so that we can guide you in the best way
*1. Educational qualifications, current Education Level and subject combination.*
*2. Career aspirations and motivations for the field*
*3. Hobbies and interests*
*4. Family members, siblings*
*5. Name of O-level and A-level school*
*6. Term fee at school and who has been supporting the child's education so far.*
*7. The year when you child’s A level will end*
*8. The province where you lives*


You can also add anything more that you would like to share.
07/03/24, 12:28 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Let me brief you that, I want to brief you that the criteria before the pandemic was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is *a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.
07/03/24, 12:40 pm - +27 61 867 3602: Dats gud news

Kelvin recently passed his A level with 11 points with grades A in Metthamatics ,C in economics  and C in Businesses enterprise. He did his   O level at Ezekiel Guti and A level at mfm Academy. Kelvin has got one elder  brother and the mother as his family.The father passed away and his mother was supporting his education. Kelvin is staying in Harare province.He is interested in computers and playing cards <This message was edited>

08/03/24, 10:46 am - Pallika Edoofa: Ms. Alice, Considering the interests, Let me tell you that we do not offer Actuarial science as a course, while Actuarial Science is indeed an independent and specialized degree program, there are certain aspects to consider that make a Bachelor of Commerce (BCom) a favorable alternative for students
While Actuarial Science is a field with a unique focus on risk management and financial security, the comprehensive nature of a BCom degree can offer a strong foundation for a successful and diverse career in various other sectors including risk management and financial security.

*Now, as you know, Edoofa Recommends India as a Higher Education Platform.*
May I know what is your knowledge or what have you researched about India and the Indian Education System?
08/03/24, 11:51 am - +263 78 345 9995: Yes. Edoofa has a strong  focus on making higher education more accessible to students in India and it's already helped thousands of students find the right program for them. The platform uses a proprietary algorithm to match students with program that a good fit for them based on their interests, goals, and other factors. Edoofa is also to make higher education more accessible by offering scholarships and financial aid information. Focus on support provided by Edoofa is really helping students feel confident and supported in their journey to higher education.
08/03/24, 11:56 am - Pallika Edoofa: Kelvin,  I am really glad to see your knowledge about India and the Indian Education System. It is good that you have started researching and familiarising yourself with the opportunities.
08/03/24, 11:56 am - Pallika Edoofa: Also, I can see, you have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead.

*By any chance are you familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship?*
08/03/24, 12:01 pm - +263 78 345 9995: India educational system. Is focus on rote learning, means that students are expected to memorize and recall information rather than analyze or apply it. This can be both a strength and a weakness of the system. On the one hand, it can lead to students a strong understanding of the material.
08/03/24, 12:01 pm - +263 78 345 9995: Noted ma'am
08/03/24, 12:02 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's right!
08/03/24, 12:02 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Please let me know this! <This message was edited>
08/03/24, 12:06 pm - +263 78 345 9995: In Canada tuition fee can range from $15,000 to $60,000 per year .In Australia can range from $20,000 to $50,000 per year
08/03/24, 12:14 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That’s alright, Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India compared to other global hubs.

In India, international students face an average expense of *$6000-$8000 annually.* While this is very low as compared to the Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc where the cost of education ranges from $15000-$35000 annually, it is still beyond the reach of many.

With the Edoofa Scholarship Program, the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000 per annum* for the students who are found eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility Check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Laundry, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
08/03/24, 12:14 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
08/03/24, 12:15 pm - Pallika Edoofa: In simple words what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost $3000 or less a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well. 

However, as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even after this we allow the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.

*So do you feel the reduced cost of education is affordable to your family?*
08/03/24, 12:16 pm - +263 78 345 9995: Yes i do ma'am
08/03/24, 12:19 pm - +263 78 345 9995: Noted
08/03/24, 12:28 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Good to know, 
So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians. Looking at this cost of education as well, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits which can help in reducing their fees further.

Do you know how that is done?
08/03/24, 12:30 pm - +263 78 345 9995: Yes ma'am
08/03/24, 12:31 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Please let me know how?
08/03/24, 12:32 pm - +263 78 345 9995: Nooo bbe I don't really know please let me know my mistake
08/03/24, 12:33 pm - +263 78 345 9995: And ma'am me and my family we are willing to take this opportunity
08/03/24, 12:40 pm - +27 61 867 3602: Gud day ma'am  I just want  to thank u for giving us all de information I appreciate all what u have done for us    I'm supporting Kelvin.to take this opportunity  n I'm happy for him
08/03/24, 12:44 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Thank you for sharing this, Dear Parent, I am so happy to hear this
08/03/24, 12:44 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That’s alright, Let me tell you how Edoofa helps Edoofians bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the *Earn While You Learn Program*

The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that are equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.The Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies and needs, converting an Individual into a market-ready professional. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
08/03/24, 12:44 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Projects with Brands and Companies: -*
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, such as:
*Africa Global Radio-* The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project and hear from the CEO about the exposures of the Edoofa program.

*Skooqs-* This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

*Recruitment Partners:-*
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

*Webinars:-*
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars regularly with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
-Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
-How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi
-How to be industry-ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu
-It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje
-Decoding the science of personal branding by Mr, Simon Maingi
08/03/24, 12:45 pm - Pallika Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field. These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.

*What are your views on the same? Do you think you will be benefiting from the Earn While You Learn Program?*
08/03/24, 12:49 pm - +263 78 345 9995: Yes ma'am
08/03/24, 12:59 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
08/03/24, 12:59 pm - Pallika Edoofa: If I have to help you explain how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable compared to Local Universities, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now, if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, bringing the cost further down to $1000 per year including the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month. *This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*

*You can see this even in this scholarship credit certificate where one of our star performers, our Proud Edoodians  Masinire Miriam earned $1965 within a year.* I hope you can now realize the power of the EWYL program to reduce the financial pressure on families.

08/03/24, 1:02 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Great, Now, as we are proceeding towards the end, let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, a few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :

*1. Expert Career Counselling:* We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counsellors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.

*2. Affordability through guaranteed scholarships:* Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off.

*3. Earn While You Learn:* The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing our students for the real world. 

*4.Higher Education Concierge:* A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.*

After going through these facts that make Edoofa different, which one out of the 4 did you feel is the most significant?
08/03/24, 1:06 pm - +263 78 345 9995: I think 3
08/03/24, 1:16 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Great! 
So now I know you focus more on affordability and employability.
Let me also show you some monthly earnings of students through Earn While You Learn.

08/03/24, 1:22 pm - +263 78 345 9995: Thank you ma'am
08/03/24, 1:23 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Please address this
08/03/24, 1:23 pm - +263 78 345 9995: Both my mother and big brother will be helping me
08/03/24, 1:24 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That’s understandable,I believe you'll be discussing everything with your family after we complete today's session. Also, after our counselling session, I would connect to some of our beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know their experiences and proceedings well.

May I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
08/03/24, 1:25 pm - +263 78 345 9995: My family is ready and feel good about this opportunity
08/03/24, 1:28 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, as studying Internationally would make your career advance at an even greater pace, as you will be transformed into a professional with a well-paying job, which would help you in uplifting your family there by yourself, and provide a peaceful and hassle-free life to your parents.
08/03/24, 1:28 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *As we move to the last part of the session, let me highlight a few requirements while a student applies alone* 

*1) Application Form* -An online or offline form that asks for your personal details and academic background.

*2) Statement of Purpose-* An essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and your aspirations for your career.

*3) Letter of Recommendation-* from Senior authorities, School Heads or others on why they recommend you to be a right fit for an international university.
Do you know about other requirements?
08/03/24, 1:31 pm - +263 78 345 9995: Noted
08/03/24, 1:32 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, When a student applies alone for an international University, on average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose costs between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally and act as a major parameter to decide the child’s eligibility. If you apply to 5 Universities, the average costs for the mentioned would be $1350-$1750, *without even receiving a guarantee to be selected*

*Edoofa has identified a solution for this uncertainty and unaffordability.* If a student qualifies after the eligibility check, not only does Edoofa help them draft their statement of purpose but also helps in terms of Visa Documentation Assistance, University Session and selection, Individual mentorship, etc, reducing the costs significantly to $750 which is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
08/03/24, 1:32 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
08/03/24, 1:33 pm - +263 78 345 9995: Yes ma'am
08/03/24, 1:34 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Sure, Let me tell *you why and when the enrollment fee is paid?*
08/03/24, 1:34 pm - Pallika Edoofa: The enrollment fee is to be paid only if a child is found eligible for the Edoofa Scholarship Program after passing the eligibility check stage, it includes, 

*Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
*Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
*Earn While You Learn Program and training*
*University sessions and selection*
*A guaranteed scholarship seat*
*Visa Documentation Assistance*
*The Foster and Care throughout the course of an Edoofian*
08/03/24, 1:34 pm - Pallika Edoofa: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge due to which parents might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short period of 7 days and for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option wherein if the student is found eligible, instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, *parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days thereby reducing the financial pressure.*

08/03/24, 2:49 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's wonderful to hear! It's natural to feel proud and relieved knowing your son has the opportunity to pursue his dream of studying abroad at a reputable university. Supporting him in fulfilling his aspirations is truly a remarkable journey.
