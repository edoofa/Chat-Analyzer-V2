07/03/24, 10:00 am - +263 71 489 9461: Uuum first of all im grateful for this moment 
1)What inspired me is the Trish's story when she confessed that Edoofa was able to help her complete her tertiary education,I was just inspired by the story that this programme really helped her out and she is someone that is testifying today,which just manage to rise my hopes that the programme might also be able to help me.

I understand that tge Edoofa programme is there to give assistance to young people who are hoping and striving for a better future ,it is there to help the young generation in making it to the top since education is believed to be the key to success ,so Edoofa is an organisation that cateers for the tertiary education....like in the modern world we are living there are a number of kids that have ambitions that can be fulfilled through education but due to the economic hardships there are forced by situation to let go of their dreams,so Edoofa is there to help in this kind of a situation
07/03/24, 10:01 am - Pallika Edoofa: Lisa, I am glad to see your understanding of the Edoofa program and appreciate your aspirations, let me guide you further to gain more knowledge on this opportunity.
