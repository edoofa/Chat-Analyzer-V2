06/03/24, 4:17 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Ms. Egness, Let me brief you that, I want to brief you that the criteria before the pandemic was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is *a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.
06/03/24, 4:20 pm - +263 77 698 2598: thank you so much
06/03/24, 4:21 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright!
06/03/24, 4:21 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Based on my evaluation, considering Yvette's subjects, interests, and passion, she is eligible to pursue
