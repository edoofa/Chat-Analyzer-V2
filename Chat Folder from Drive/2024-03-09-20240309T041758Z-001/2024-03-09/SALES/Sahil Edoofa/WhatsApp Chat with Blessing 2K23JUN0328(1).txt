18/10/23, 2:03 pm - +263 78 241 8378: Yes ma'am and I believe we are on stage 4 where we are waiting for offer letters from colleges/ universities
18/10/23, 2:03 pm - +91 72920 63289: Yes, you are absolutely correct. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
18/10/23, 2:03 pm - +91 72920 63289: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
18/10/23, 2:03 pm - +91 72920 63289: As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
18/10/23, 2:06 pm - +263 78 241 8378: Thank you soo much
18/10/23, 2:07 pm - +91 72920 63289: You are most welcome. With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
18/10/23, 2:07 pm - +91 72920 63289: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
18/10/23, 2:07 pm - +91 72920 63289: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

6. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
18/10/23, 2:07 pm - +91 72920 63289: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
18/10/23, 2:13 pm - +263 78 241 8378: I have reviewed them let's proceed
18/10/23, 2:13 pm - +91 72920 63289: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
18/10/23, 2:13 pm - +91 72920 63289: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of the students A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, his/her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and his/her Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive his/her letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where his/her scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete his/her registration formalities, you will be presented with his/her Official Admission Letter with the help of which he/she will be able to apply for the student visa.
18/10/23, 2:14 pm - +91 72920 63289: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means Blessing, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing his/her seat before the competition even begins. He/She will be the trailblazer among his/her peers, firmly positioning his/her as a frontier person in this endeavor.
18/10/23, 2:33 pm - +263 78 241 8378: Noted maam
18/10/23, 2:34 pm - +91 72920 63289: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
18/10/23, 2:34 pm - +91 72920 63289: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
18/10/23, 2:34 pm - +91 72920 63289: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
18/10/23, 3:16 pm - +263 78 241 8378: I think it does
18/10/23, 3:22 pm - +91 72920 63289: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*
 
I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
18/10/23, 3:23 pm - +91 72920 63289: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
18/10/23, 4:58 pm - +263 78 241 8378: Sorry I was held up with work. This stage is noted
18/10/23, 5:08 pm - +91 72920 63289: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*
 
I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
18/10/23, 5:08 pm - +91 72920 63289: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
18/10/23, 5:08 pm - +91 72920 63289: For instance, if your deadline is set for November 02, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before November 02, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by December 02, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
18/10/23, 10:57 pm - +91 72920 63289: I was looking forward to receiving a response from you, but it appears that you are presently unavailable. Given that our working hours for today have come to an end and considering it has been a long day, I'll reach out to you again tomorrow at 12:30 p.m. I hope this timing is convenient for you and that you'll be accessible for our scheduled session without any delay. Wishing you a pleasant evening.
19/10/23, 4:58 pm - +263 78 241 8378: Noted maam
19/10/23, 4:59 pm - +91 72920 63289: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
19/10/23, 5:01 pm - +263 78 241 8378: Not yet maam
19/10/23, 5:01 pm - +91 72920 63289: I am glad to hear that. As Blessing's guardian, are you excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that Blessing is among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
19/10/23, 5:02 pm - +263 78 241 8378: Yes we are awaiting for the next steps
19/10/23, 5:03 pm - +91 72920 63289: I am happy to hear that. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to *evaluate their application* after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
19/10/23, 5:05 pm - +263 78 241 8378: Thank you so much for your patience.we look forward to hearing from you soon
14/11/23, 10:32 pm - +91 72920 63289: This message was deleted

Since our last discussion, the admissions team has been working diligently to process your scholarship application for universities in India under the Endowment plan. I am pleased to inform you that your application has been accepted by one of the leading universities, *Galgotias University* in India, and they have decided to offer you a scholarship.
14/11/23, 10:33 pm - +91 72920 63289: The university will be mailing you the official offer letter shortly. However, since we received it in advance, we wanted to share this wonderful news with you and provide a head start on our discussions. I kindly request you to take your time to thoroughly review the letter. We will have a detailed discussion about its contents tomorrow at 12:00 PM.

In the meantime, I recommend that you make note of any questions or concerns that may arise as you review the letter. By setting a specific time, we can ensure that one of your family representatives will be available to connect with us.
14/11/23, 10:33 pm - +91 72920 63289: This discussion will be an opportunity for me to assist you in gaining a better understanding of the remaining contents of your offer letter, addressing any queries you may have, and providing guidance on the requirements for the rest of your admission journey.

To schedule our discussion, please confirm your availability for the proposed time. If this time is not convenient for you, please share your availability within the window from 12:00 PM to 3:00 PM, and we will arrange a suitable connection time accordingly.

15/11/23, 11:58 am - +91 72920 63289: Good morning Parents and Blessing,

Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion for you and your family, and I can only imagine the excitement that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.
15/11/23, 11:58 am - +91 72920 63289: Now that you have the letter in your possession, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you've had the chance to go through the offer letter thoroughly? 

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
16/11/23, 10:49 am - +263 78 241 8378: Morning ma'am
16/11/23, 10:49 am - +263 78 241 8378: Sorry for the delaying responding we were going through the university offer letter
16/11/23, 12:00 pm - +263 71 840 6575: Good afternoon ma'am
16/11/23, 12:01 pm - +263 71 840 6575: Yes we have
16/11/23, 12:35 pm - +91 72920 63289: Good afternoon Parents and Blessing.

I hope you are doing well. Since we were unable to complete our discussion yesterday may I know if you are available to connect with us now to move ahead with the discussion?
16/11/23, 12:35 pm - +263 78 241 8378: Yes I am
16/11/23, 1:02 pm - +91 72920 63289: I am glad to hear that. As we proceed with today's discussion, we will get into the details of this specific offer letter. I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.
16/11/23, 1:02 pm - +91 72920 63289: The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
16/11/23, 1:16 pm - +263 78 241 8378: Yes let's go on
16/11/23, 1:23 pm - +91 72920 63289: Amazing. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
16/11/23, 1:23 pm - +91 72920 63289: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-	

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4) You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
16/11/23, 1:27 pm - +263 78 241 8378: 1. It's $900
2 . 5 years
3. 300
4 750

Please take note ma'am after doing the calculations of the semester fee and accomodation etc as a family we feel that we are not able to afford it.
16/11/23, 2:25 pm - +91 72920 63289: Yes, that is absolutely correct and thank you for sharing your responses. As outlined in your offer letter, your course is a three-year program, with each academic year consisting of two semesters, totaling 6 semesters for your degree. 

With the scholarship offered, your tuition fee per semester reduces to $900, which means your annual tuition fee (calculated as $900 * 2) is $1800. I hope this clarifies the tuition fee structure for you?
16/11/23, 2:26 pm - +91 72920 63289: I understand that it can be a challenging amount to raise, however, please do not worry as we move ahead with our discussion we shall be discussing even how to make education more affordable.
16/11/23, 2:28 pm - +263 78 241 8378: Ok thank you
16/11/23, 2:30 pm - +91 72920 63289: I am pleased that we've been able to make progress. Moving forward, I would like to help you with a concise overview of the two accommodation options available at Galgotias University -
16/11/23, 2:30 pm - +91 72920 63289: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
16/11/23, 2:30 pm - +91 72920 63289: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You will be able to seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also go for accommodation independently and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
17/11/23, 12:20 pm - +91 72920 63289: Good afternoon Parents and Blessing

I hope you are doing well. I was hoping to get a response from you yesterday however, you did not respond although I noticed that you were able to go through my message. May I know if we are still connected?
17/11/23, 12:47 pm - +263 78 241 8378: Afternoon we got your message yes and we were still trying to figure out if it would work out for use
17/11/23, 12:47 pm - +263 78 241 8378: Having the accomodation fees reduced is fine but we feel that the tuition fee is very high for a scholarship
17/11/23, 1:48 pm - +263 71 840 6575: We are doing well ma'am . yes we are .


Ma'am the fees are quite expensive for us . we can not afford it as we are very poor
17/11/23, 2:17 pm - +91 72920 63289: @263718406575 I understand however, as we move ahead with our discussion I would also be explaining you how you can reduce the financial burden as well.
17/11/23, 2:19 pm - +263 71 840 6575: Oky ma'am
17/11/23, 2:20 pm - +91 72920 63289: It is great to hear that you're following our conversation closely. I am sure you can see that Galgotias University values students' well-being and takes a thoughtful approach to accommodation arrangements. 

They understand the significance of students feeling comfortable in their environment to excel academically. Instead of imposing choices, the university allows students to visit the campus, assess their options, and make informed decisions about whether they prefer on-campus or off-campus accommodation. 

I hope this clarifies the university's approach to accommodation and transportation for you?
17/11/23, 2:26 pm - +263 71 840 6575: Yes
17/11/23, 2:27 pm - +91 72920 63289: Moving forward, as you can see in your offer letter, you have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with the registration fee due as well?
17/11/23, 2:31 pm - +263 71 840 6575: Ydz
17/11/23, 2:31 pm - +263 71 840 6575: Yes
17/11/23, 2:51 pm - +91 72920 63289: Alright please, it is reassuring to see you following through. Please allow me to share some great news with you. As you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300, mentioned in the letter, has been entirely waived under the Early Registration Scheme and the Endowment Plan. This means it will not be added to your overall cost of education.
17/11/23, 2:51 pm - +91 72920 63289: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on November 28th, 2023*. I hope we are together so far?
17/11/23, 5:02 pm - +263 71 840 6575: We are  .But we cannot pay $750  this is so as my parents only earn $100 per month its too expensive for us ma'am
17/11/23, 8:42 pm - +91 72920 63289: In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
18/11/23, 8:05 am - +91 72920 63289: Good day, Parents and Blessing,

I trust this message finds you in good health. I had anticipated receiving a response from you, but it appears that you haven't had the opportunity to reply, although I did notice that you have read my previous message. May I kindly ask if we are still connected?
20/11/23, 5:58 pm - +91 72920 63289: Good evening Parents and Blessing.

I hope you are doing well, I was hoping to get a response from you however, you did not respond despite our reach out on Saturday, may I know if you are facing any challenges, I would appreciate it if you share your challenge with us transparently?
20/11/23, 10:41 pm - +91 72920 63289: I was hoping to get a response, however you did not response, since our available hours for today are over, so we will be connecting with you tomorrow at 06:00 pm.

21/11/23, 9:55 pm - +91 72920 63289: Greetings.

I trust this message finds you well. I've been eagerly anticipating your response, as we have yet to finalize our discussion regarding the university's letter. I understand that circumstances may have prevented you from being available recently, and I want to convey the importance of this conversation. Given that the letter comes with a specified deadline, timely discussion is crucial to ensure your comprehensive understanding of its contents. I kindly urge you to prioritize this matter so we can proceed efficiently.
22/11/23, 11:05 am - +263 78 241 8378: Afternoon I totally understand the purpose of this discussion thought still mantain that for me the average Zimbabwean parent I find the fees to be very high for a scholarship.We had assumed that the fees would be cheaper than here back home. Unfortunately we feel that we have to pull out now as she is not our only child in school we still need to cater for others as well. We are very grateful for your effort to get our daughter educated. Thank you so much
22/11/23, 7:17 pm - +91 72920 63289: Good evening Parents and Blessing.

I hope you are doing well. Thank you for sharing that with me, I completely understand what you are trying to say as a parent I understand where you are coming from. However, I would like to know which part of the cost you think is expensive, because the promise that we did the cost range that you were told which is $2000-$3000 the cost of education for blessing is within that rate, including food and accommodation, so I would like to understand, maybe you can hep me with that?
22/11/23, 7:18 pm - +263 71 840 6575: The fees is expensive
22/11/23, 7:18 pm - +263 71 840 6575: And so is the accommodation maam
22/11/23, 7:21 pm - +263 71 840 6575: We can not afford it
22/11/23, 8:37 pm - +91 72920 63289: Thank you for sharing that with me, however, as I remember the counseling sessions you yourself agreed to that fact when we asked you that the cost range of $2000-$3000 is affordable, and blessings annual breakdown comes to $2800 only, so I am unable to understand what part seems expensive to you which you are not able to afford, I belive there is some under lying reason that you are not sharing with me, I would appreciate it you help me understand your challenges openly, I will only be able to help Blessing here if you are transparent with me, please?
23/11/23, 12:49 pm - +91 72920 63289: Good afternoon Parents and Blessing.

I hope you are doing well. I hope this message reaches you in good health. I have been looking forward to a response from you following my previous message. However, I understand that you might not have had the chance to reply yet. Could you please confirm if we are still in communication?

Good Morning Parents and Blessing,

I hope this message finds you in good health. I am Ms. Vilsha, Head of Admissions at Edoofa.

13/12/23, 9:15 am - +91 81787 23499: While our team has been consistently reaching out to you to understand your concerns in-depth, time is of the essence. To proactively address this matter, I have personally scheduled a meeting with the academic board and university officials on the 15th of December 2023 to present your case and explore potential solutions.

14/12/23, 6:49 pm - +263 78 241 8378: Good afternoon our challenge details are the school fees we thought it being a scholarship we could afford it but we found it to be too expensive so we have decided to abort the whole abroad educational because it seems back home it's cheaper. We are really sorry for wasting your time. Please accept our apologies.

I trust this message finds you well, and I hope you are in high spirits. In recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their A-Level results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey.
16/01/24, 11:15 am - +91 72920 63289: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?
24/01/24, 9:25 am - Sahil Edoofa: Good Day @263718406575  @263782418378 , 
*I am Mr Sahil, Senior Career Counsellor at Edoofa*

24/01/24, 9:26 am - Sahil Edoofa: Recalling our counseling and evaluation sessions, I take pride in your qualification for our esteemed Edoofa Scholarship Program. Recently, the A-level results from all my students have brought immense joy. Your name, in particular, caught my attention, and I was going through your Admissions Group and was shocked to see that you weren't able to complete the University registration process being a bright student and I still remember your passion for career and goals, making you one of my favourite students.  I personally had a discussion with the Admissions Head and have decided to help you in the best possible way as I understand your calibre.  May I know, what exactly happened due to which you weren't able to proceed and what are your plans as of now?
24/01/24, 8:11 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I see you have gone through my messages earlier but did not respond back, *please If there is something that is concerning you because of which you are not Proceeding ahead with your process, then I would request you to come forward and address the same with me here in the group so that I can provide you with a solution to cater to your issues and guide you with your admissions procedures.*

God Bless you,
Have a great day ahead!
