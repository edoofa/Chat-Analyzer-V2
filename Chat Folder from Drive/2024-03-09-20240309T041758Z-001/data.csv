234 - 08 Mar 2024 01:45PM - Aditi Edoofa: When the school’s per-term fees are less than $100, we do not get a school call done by Edoofa's Program Director. The reason behind this is that it is very much doubt that the students from this school will or will not be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education. So in such a case, we insist that students to forms a WhatsApp group where they add me. After forming the group they: 1) either ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to specifically add those prospective students who will be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education. After they add, then tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them or 2)ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to share those prospective students' contact details with you, so that you can add them and then educate them about Edoofa. After that, tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them

There is no order in which you have to do the project. There is no limit on how much you have to do a project. There is no limit to the number of scholarship credits one can earn through projects. It's simple, the *more you work on it, the more scholarship credits you earn.* Moreover, it is important *that you make steady progress every day*.

318 - 08 Mar 2024 11:40AM - +263 71 616 0258: Ok lemme tell u
319 - 08 Mar 2024 11:50AM - +263 71 616 0258: Well previously I've been asking you to resend those schools connect forms right... Yes. My goal is to connect almost all schools in Victoria Falls on this program because the city is a small and busy city, trends move very quickly and I'm pretty sure most of the kids have got dreams of studying abroad...  Then let me tell you another factor.... Zimbabwean politics in universities are pretty stiff and most of the people who wish to study things such as Law, medicine and all that, they hardly get the chance to do so. This is because that universities are limited and big courses are occupied by the Elite. On the Law firm and politics, if you're not Shona tribe, they're likely to draw u to lite courses such as Journalism and tourism. This is so just because there's hidden tribalism going on in this country and they don't want oppositions from other tribes.  Moreover, the cut off points are strict. For Law and Medicine, most of the universities require 15 points for boys n 14 for girls and they're strict on that one.  They're just alot of reasons why people here need to be saved
320 - 08 Mar 2024 12:26PM - Ananya Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your vision and the challenges faced by students in Victoria Falls. It's commendable that you're aiming to connect schools in the area, especially considering the rapid pace of trends and the aspirations many students have for studying abroad.
321 - 08 Mar 2024 12:42PM - Ananya Edoofa: Now, in order to move ahead with your vision, we have to lay out a plan of how you will connect with the students so that I can discuss this with Jyotishman Sir. As you know, if you wish to be a student leader there, you have to have a plan. So, do you have something in your mind?
322 - 08 Mar 2024 12:51PM - +263 71 616 0258: Yes i had a plan but you can add your views.  I spoke to the director of the school I'm employed at right now as a part time tutor to help me to connect with the local highschools to set an appointment for me to go and speak to them in person for a better understanding.
323 - 08 Mar 2024 03:32PM - Ananya Edoofa: That's great! I will share a few more ideas with you in tomorrow's session. So, don't miss it!

I discussed Casper's application with the Academic Board and they have suggested alternative solutions instead of applying for the intake 2026. May I know which board of education Caspar study in? Is it ZIMSEC or Cambridge?

318 - 08 Mar 2024 04:12PM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know, Casper. For Cambridge students, to be eligible for the Bachelor's in Pharmacy, you need to have 3 passes in Physics, Chemistry, and Maths/Biology. Since you will be appearing for the AS Physics in June 2025, the results will be declared in August and September. At that time, you will have to take proactive steps and be ready with all the documentation so that you can come to India as soon as you receive the offer letter from the universities. For the time, you can continue with EWYL sessions normally.  I hope I was clear with all the information? <This message was edited>

273 - 08 Mar 2024 11:53AM - Dev Edoofa: I completely understand your genuine concern. However, I wanted to help you understand, that 20-30% of students who enroll in the Edoofa Scholarship Program, every year are unable to come to India due to poor preparation of Finances. To solve this recurrence, Edoofa designed the Edoofa Secure Plan to ensure that students should not be able to let go of the golden opportunity to grow just because of poor preparation of finances. I understand the financial constraints that you may have in the future, but I also believe that you want to see Shalom become a successful individual in her respective field of study and moreover, life. The purpose of this plan is to help the parents save $1500 at the end of 10 months, i.e. January. This will greatly help the parents to ensure that their children can grab seats before other students as well as help the parents to prepare for the finances for the whole year and, not to forget the added benefits that were mentioned above. I hope understand what I am trying to convey?

377 - 06 Mar 2024 03:33PM - Kirti Edoofa: As of now, your application has been only accepted by the MVN university and since we have shared your application with multiple universities, we are also hoping to receive updates from multiple universities. Once we get the same, we will surely inform you, but each university takes its own time to consider the application and so you have to be patient while the universities are evaluating the application.  I hope you are clear about this now?

I completely understand your concern here. However, as you know that each university takes its own time to evaluate an application, In that case, if you wish to wait for an update from let us say University A and end up missing the opportunity given by MVN, you would lose out on the scholarship from MVN and won't be able to join it in the future.  To help you with that, there is a transfer option available to the students. Are you aware of that?

206 - 08 Mar 2024 11:07AM - Kirti Edoofa: That is good to know. After speaking with thousands of students and parents who completed their admission process before you, we realized that the current economic situation in African countries makes it a bit challenging for parents to pay the full registration fee at once.  In response to the same challenge, we had a detailed discussion with the academic board and university official. As a result, we developed a solution to alleviate the financial burden of the parents specifically for the registration fee due of $500 to $1000.
207 - 08 Mar 2024 11:07AM - Kirti Edoofa: We at Edoofa are thrilled about this development, and I believe it will significantly help all of our students and their families. Are you aware of the solution?
208 - 08 Mar 2024 11:13AM - +263 77 463 0093: I wasn't aware, that's good news I'm I getting this right on the last statement reading alleviate the financial burden of the parents specifically for the registration fee due of $500 to $1000. Is it not vise versa like of $1000 to $500
214 - 08 Mar 2024 11:33AM - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: Consider that your registration fee is $1000. After you will receive the offer letter, the first part of the registration fees which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, i.e. $500 needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university (For most of the universities 15 days). Subsequently, the second part of $500, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
215 - 08 Mar 2024 11:33AM - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for March 15, 2024, and your registration fee stands at $1000, you'll need to make a payment of $500 on or before March 15, 2024. The remaining $500 should be paid by April 15, 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
216 - 08 Mar 2024 11:35AM - +263 77 463 0093: I follow
217 - 08 Mar 2024 11:36AM - Kirti Edoofa: That is good to know. As Kundai's guardian, are you excited to initiate the process? For the current round of admissions, only 31 scholarship seats are available and hence let us begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the payment plan offered for the registration fee. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
218 - 08 Mar 2024 11:43AM - +263 77 463 0093: Yes
219 - 08 Mar 2024 12:22PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.  The universities would take three to five days of time to *evaluate their application* after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter.  In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.

Let me tell you there were over 2700 attendees and out of these 2,700 attendees, our team had the privilege of engaging in 30-minute one-on-one sessions with 487 students, including Mr. Austin, Ms. Vilsha, Mr. Abhinav, Mr. Jyotishman, and Mr. Piyush and the director of Edoofa. As per the records that I have, it seems as if you were not able to meet the team for a one on one? If I may ask, may I know if there is any particular reason because of which you were not able to meet the team personally?

399 - 08 Mar 2024 01:20PM - Kirti Edoofa: In the meantime, I am curious if you or your family members had any interactions with students or parents who attended the seminar?

420 - 08 Mar 2024 08:07AM - +263 77 626 4514: Yes we managed to, but our concern is what if I don't get accepted at any other university, l will be forced to study at this one.
421 - 08 Mar 2024 08:07AM - +263 77 626 4514: Good  morning.
422 - 08 Mar 2024 08:12AM - Kirti Edoofa: @263776264514 May I know why you think that way is there any particular reason which you think you will not be able to get accepted at other universities?
423 - 08 Mar 2024 08:18AM - +263 77 626 4514: Not at all, it's just a concern.
424 - 08 Mar 2024 08:37AM - Kirti Edoofa: @263776264514 when you enrolled in Edoofa, your application was thoroughly checked and after your eligibility was confirmed then only our counselors moved forward with your application, so if you have this concern you can stay assured that you are indeed eligible for other universities as well. In fact, if you look at the transfer option is it an additional benefit for you, as you will be able reserve your seat and still have the options to explore more, you even need to consider the bigger picture here?
425 - 08 Mar 2024 09:51AM - +263 77 626 4514: Yes I am considering that.

Regarding your first concern about the locality of the university, may I know why you think it is near a village, Galgotias University is situated within the capital of India which is Delhi- NCR, so I am not able to understand your concern regarding the locality here?
434 - 08 Mar 2024 12:39PM - Kirti Edoofa: Regarding the second concern about the offer letter issue, I previously informed you about the clerical error from the university's side. Upon your request, I promptly communicated with the team to obtain the updated letter. You specifically mentioned needing the new letter with the current issue date. However, I clarified that during our discussion, the university's admin office was closed due to a 3.5-hour time difference.
435 - 08 Mar 2024 12:40PM - Kirti Edoofa: I made it a priority to share the reissued letter with you on the morning of the 7th of March, as soon as the admin office resumed operations. The issue date on the reissued letter was the same day I provided it to you. I'm having difficulty understanding your concern, @263776264514 , especially considering we promptly addressed your request and shared the updated letter following your confirmation. If there's a specific issue or misunderstanding, I'm here to assist further.

By the time you responded yesterday, it was past our available hours so we could not get back to you, however, we are available now, and we can connect today I am glad to know you were able to go through my last message, so may I know if you were able to resonate with the message above?
123 - 08 Mar 2024 08:34AM - +263 77 233 2043: The best part of the seminar was the excitement of getting so many steps closer to my dreams during the seminar. When you  played the video of your very own version of the industrial visit for the Indian Edoofians, which was SLICE CON - , I saw that Edoofa community is not just for dreamers but also executioners. I also see that you are ensuring more such opportunities for me that push me towards becoming a better professional long before the industry calls for it.
124 - 08 Mar 2024 08:49AM - Kirti Edoofa: Perfect! Now, while I have a plethora of insights from the seminar to share with you, I recognize that we are already approaching March, with academic classes commencing in August. With this timeline in mind, I am keen to hear about your educational plans. Have you and your family been able to discuss your aspirations and next steps for your university education in the past couple of days?
125 - 08 Mar 2024 08:53AM - +263 77 233 2043: Yes we have discussed about a few times about the processes
126 - 08 Mar 2024 11:34AM - Kirti Edoofa: I appreciate your transparency. Educational planning requires careful consideration and wise decisions, areas where Edoofa has excelled over our 15-year journey. As Edoofa’s Parent Organization marks its 15th Anniversary on May 11th, our commitment to guiding students like yourself towards successful careers remains steadfast.
127 - 08 Mar 2024 11:34AM - Kirti Edoofa: Among the positive seminar experiences, we encountered some sobering realities as well. We met students from the 2021 batch who, due to financial constraints, were unable to pursue their education in India as initially planned. They enrolled in local universities such as Chinhoyi University, Bindura University, University of Zimbabwe, and Harare Institute of Technology. However, upon meeting us, they expressed dissatisfaction with their current educational experiences and uncertain prospects for employment, despite substantial financial investments.
128 - 08 Mar 2024 11:34AM - Kirti Edoofa: These students revealed that they're paying $2400 at Chinhoyi University, $2600 at Bindura University, and $3200 at the University of Zimbabwe. Despite these hefty fees, they lack confidence in their future opportunities. This predicament underscores the importance of informed decision-making in education.
129 - 08 Mar 2024 11:34AM - Kirti Edoofa: I recall our last visit to Zimbabwe in May 2023, where the exchange rate was 1000 Bonds to 1 USD. Now, in just 10 months, it has skyrocketed to 18000 Bonds. This steep rise significantly has impacted students studying in Zimbabwe, increasing the challenges they face. Were you aware of this exchange rate?

132 - 08 Mar 2024 12:43PM - Kirti Edoofa: I see and as you're aware, Zimbabwe presents its own set of challenges. Our team experienced firsthand the elevated cost of living and network difficulties, which contribute to the demand of pursuing education abroad.  Additionally, there was a concerning safety incident involving our female staff members in Harare when they were followed by two men at night. While incidents like these serve as sobering reminders, they also highlight the importance of exploring educational opportunities in more stable environments.  What are your thoughts on these challenges? Do you perceive them as common occurrences in Zimbabwe?
133 - 08 Mar 2024 01:14PM - +263 77 233 2043: These challenges are quite common in Zimbabwe which makes residents uncomfortable mostly in high density areas. I also think that these challenges are caused by lack of employment which leads to people engaging in crime rates inorder to earn a living. This gives us the thought of exploring educational opportunities in more stable environment.
134 - 08 Mar 2024 01:17PM - Kirti Edoofa: That is quite unfortunate and I personally wish for you to take a step forward from your current situation and get access to better opportunities. In the light of the same, may I know how is your preparations for the registration fee going on?

Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:
214 - 08 Mar 2024 08:55AM - Kirti Edoofa: 1. *Tuition Fee*: $1000 per annum 2. *Accommodation Fee*: $800 per annum 3. *Remaining Fee Components*: [Library Fee, Examination Fee, EDB and Book Bank, International Student Development Fund, 24-Hour WiFi Cost, Maintenance Fee, Water Bill, and Electricity Bill]: $200 per annum  *Total Fee: Tuition Fee $650 + Accommodation Fee $0 + Remaining Fee Components $1000 = $1650 per annum.*  Registration Fee to be paid: $1000 (deadline within two weeks of issue of the offer letter, part of the university’s first-year fee and will be adjusted against the first-year cost of education $1650). I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?
215 - 08 Mar 2024 08:57AM - +263 77 858 0639: Noted
216 - 08 Mar 2024 08:58AM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $1000, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $1000 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $1650 as per the above example. Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $1650 - $1000 = $650. This amount can be paid within the first three days of your arrival in India.
217 - 08 Mar 2024 09:01AM - +263 71 711 4926: understood
218 - 08 Mar 2024 10:11AM - Kirti Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
219 - 08 Mar 2024 10:11AM - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your ""Earn While You Learn"" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
220 - 08 Mar 2024 10:11AM - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.

181 - 08 Mar 2024 01:10PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Alright please. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
182 - 08 Mar 2024 01:10PM - Sidhi Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $1000. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalise their registration process.
183 - 08 Mar 2024 01:10PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee.  This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counsellor has also discussed the registration fee during your counselling sessions, correct?
184 - 08 Mar 2024 01:13PM - +263 71 358 2853: Yes she did tell me about the same
185 - 08 Mar 2024 01:34PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.  I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
186 - 08 Mar 2024 02:12PM - +263 71 358 2853: Yes we are, l was told by the councilor about the same
187 - 08 Mar 2024 02:33PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:
188 - 08 Mar 2024 02:33PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 1. *Tuition Fee*: $1800 per annum 2. *Food and Accommodation Fee*: $1000 per annum  *Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum*  Registration Fee to be paid: $1000 (deadline within two weeks of issue of the offer letter, part of the university’s first-year fee and will be adjusted against the first-year cost of education $2800). I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?

However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee.  This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counsellor has also discussed the registration fee during your counselling sessions, correct?
184 - 08 Mar 2024 01:13PM - +263 71 358 2853: Yes she did tell me about the same
185 - 08 Mar 2024 01:34PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.  I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
186 - 08 Mar 2024 02:12PM - +263 71 358 2853: Yes we are, l was told by the councilor about the same
187 - 08 Mar 2024 02:33PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:
188 - 08 Mar 2024 02:33PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 1. *Tuition Fee*: $1800 per annum 2. *Food and Accommodation Fee*: $1000 per annum  *Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum*  Registration Fee to be paid: $1000 (deadline within two weeks of issue of the offer letter, part of the university’s first-year fee and will be adjusted against the first-year cost of education $2800). I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?
189 - 08 Mar 2024 02:42PM - +263 71 358 2853: Duly noted ma'am
190 - 08 Mar 2024 02:56PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $1000, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $1000 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
191 - 08 Mar 2024 02:56PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $1000 = $1800. This amount can be paid in two instalments of $900 each. The initial instalment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India.  Subsequently, the remaining balance of $900 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly instalments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
192 - 08 Mar 2024 03:09PM - +263 71 358 2853: I understand
193 - 08 Mar 2024 03:18PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
194 - 08 Mar 2024 03:18PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your ""Earn While You Learn"" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
195 - 08 Mar 2024 03:18PM - Sidhi Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
196 - 08 Mar 2024 03:25PM - +263 71 358 2853: Okay l understand ma'am but l am not yet in touch with my mentor
197 - 08 Mar 2024 03:56PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand Bornwell. May I know if you were able to share the message on your EWYL group that I had previously shared with you?

203 - 08 Mar 2024 04:26PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.  Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
204 - 08 Mar 2024 04:27PM - +263 71 358 2853: No queries
205 - 08 Mar 2024 04:33PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Alright please, Now with this, we are done with step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
206 - 08 Mar 2024 04:33PM - Sidhi Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one.
222 - 08 Mar 2024 05:24PM - +263 71 358 2853: Yes indeed ma'am
223 - 08 Mar 2024 05:25PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. With this, we can proceed to step 4 of the admission cycle, i.e., Offer Letter from University/College. The universities will take three to five days to evaluate your application, after which, if they accept your application for a scholarship, they will send you a scholarship offer letter. In the offer letter, the scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee will be mentioned.
224 - 08 Mar 2024 05:25PM - Sidhi Edoofa: On this note, let us conclude our conversation for today. I had a very good time interacting with you, Bornwell. I will reach out to you once we get an update from the universities. Wish you a blessed day ahead, and please extend our regards to your family as well.
225 - 08 Mar 2024 05:26PM - +263 71 358 2853: So what happens if they do not accept it

The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.  Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.

Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.  As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received special news for the students of the 2024 admission intake. May I know if you are excited to know the news we have for you?

208 - 08 Mar 2024 10:59AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am happy to see that you are excited. After speaking with thousands of students and parents who completed their admission process before you, we realised that the current economic situation in African countries makes it a bit challenging for parents to pay the full registration fee at once.
209 - 08 Mar 2024 10:59AM - Sidhi Edoofa: In response to the same challenge, we had a detailed discussion with the academic board and university official. As a result, we developed a solution to alleviate the financial burden of the parents specifically for the registration fee due of $500 to $1000.  We at Edoofa are thrilled about this development, and I believe it will significantly help all of our students and their families. Are you aware of the solution?

211 - 08 Mar 2024 11:30AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Let me share a bit more with you. With respect to the conversation we had with the academic board and the university officials, we requested them to allow the students to make the payment of their registration fee in two parts within a span of 45 days thereby reducing the financial pressure.  Here's how it works: Consider that your registration fee is $1000. After you will receive the offer letter, the first part of the registration fees which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, i.e. $500 needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university (For most of the universities 15 days). Subsequently, the second part of $500, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
212 - 08 Mar 2024 11:30AM - Sidhi Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for March 29, 2024, and your registration fee stands at $1000, you'll need to make a payment of $500 on or before March 29, 2024. The remaining $500 should be paid by April 29 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
210 - 08 Mar 2024 11:26AM - +263 71 656 1426: Yes ma'am

215 - 08 Mar 2024 12:10PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Alright, please. With this, we can proceed to step 4 of the admission cycle, i.e., *Offer Letter from University/College*. Are you excited to initiate the process? For the current round of admissions, only 31 scholarship seats are available and hence let us begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the payment plan offered for the registration fee. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
216 - 08 Mar 2024 12:11PM - +263 71 656 1426: Yes I am
217 - 08 Mar 2024 12:16PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am happy to hear that, dear. With this, we can proceed to step 4 of the admission cycle, i.e., Offer Letter from University/College. The universities will take three to five days to evaluate your application, after which, if they accept your application for a scholarship, they will send you a scholarship offer letter. In the offer letter, the scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee will be mentioned.
218 - 08 Mar 2024 12:16PM - Sidhi Edoofa: On this note, let us conclude our conversation for today. I had a very good time interacting with you, Darlington. I will reach out to you once we get an update from the universities. Wish you a blessed day ahead, and please extend our regards to your family as well.

Nonetheless, it's crucial to recognize Africa's significant youth population, which presents immense potential. While current prospects for local businesses and companies may be uncertain, there's a growing trend of foreign companies seeking to tap into Africa's vast youth workforce and expand their presence in the region. Looking ahead to the end of the decade when Grace completes her education, the demand for business knowledge is expected to rise substantially, aligning with the evolving economic landscape and opportunities emerging across Africa.
232 - 08 Mar 2024 09:51AM - Sidhi Edoofa: With her skills and knowledge, she will have the potential to guide and build the market, and she will not need to be dependent on seeking jobs from other big companies. Business is one of the most in-demand skills across the world, and no matter where she is, whether in India, Africa, or the United States, her skills will be relevant everywhere, making her employable in all these countries. Moreover, since you are sending her abroad to study, may I know if you wish for her to return to Africa for employment once she graduates? Holding an international degree will be very valuable, and she will be eligible for amazing opportunities worldwide.

However on the same note, as your admission officer, I would want to help you to maximise your savings. Our goal with the Financial Secure Plan is to provide stability and reliability. That is why we also provide benefits to the students participating in the plan such as the $150 waiver and the compounding bonus to address the challenges of the Zimbabwean economy. May I know if you believe this plan could offer more benefits compared to saving independently? <This message was edited>
339 - 08 Mar 2024 05:13PM - +263 77 463 0352: Good to know if we are now together. Please enlighten me, need to know more about this.
340 - 08 Mar 2024 05:58PM - Sidhi Edoofa: By being a part of the Financial Secure Plan, you will receive a $150 waiver, provided all the conditions in the agreement have been met. If you have already completed the payment of $350 towards the Edoofa Enrolment fee, the amount of $150 that you paid for the Edoofa Enrolment fee will be adjusted towards your university fee and hence can act as a part of your 10th instalment. If you are yet to pay the remaining $150 towards the Enrollment Fee, it will be waived off and you can continue with the Financial Secure Plan as discussed.
341 - 08 Mar 2024 06:00PM - Sidhi Edoofa: The compound bonus refers to the savings you are achieving choosing to save with Edoofa rather than a bank. Typically, banks charge a monthly ""bank fee,"" amounting to approximately $15 based on your deposit amount. Under the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan, not only do you get to save an amount of $150 overall, along with that you are getting a waiver of $150. Essentially, combined with the $150 waiver, Edoofa is paying you $15 every month to keep your money safe, whereas banks charge you $15 every month to keep your money safe. In recognition of the commitment demonstrated by you through timely instalment payments, you will be eligible for the $150 waiver.

299 - 08 Mar 2024 02:08PM - +263 71 287 4448: This one was successfully transferred to his account, I think the problem here is the agent and his bank there are certain charges for depositing into Master Card by the bank which I wasn't aware of but not with standing the  shortfalls the agent received the money immediately that day it was deposited, I had to visit the bank in order to retrace the records and update with the correct information. There was a shortfall of 10 dollars and and I had paid as reflected on the last bank confirmation receipt, I am very sorry for the inconvenience caused, If I may request that we have  the school account so that we will transfer fees direct into the school account to avoid unnecessary agent  charges. <This message was edited>

Suppose your fee breakdown is as follows:  1. *Tuition Fee*: $650 per annum 2. *Accommodation Fee*: $0 per annum (100% Sponsorship) 3. *Remaining Fee Components*: [Library Fee, Examination Fee, EDB and Book Bank, International Student Development Fund, 24-Hour WiFi Cost, Maintenance Fee, Water Bill, and Electricity Bill]: $1000 per annum  *Total Fee: Tuition Fee $650 + Accommodation Fee $0 + Remaining Fee Components $1000 = $1650 per annum.*
300 - 08 Mar 2024 04:22PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Upon securing your seat with a registration payment of $1000, the remaining fee to be paid upon arrival in India will be $1650 - $1000 = $650. The remaining $500 saved will count towards these costs. May I know if this breakdown helped you to understand the process in a better manner? <This message was edited>

232 - 08 Mar 2024 03:56PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. Let me share my views as well so that it will help you expand your understanding.  *Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students:* In the first video, the founders of Edoofa highlight the promising journey awaiting new Edoofians, citing examples of scholarship beneficiaries who've transformed their lives in India. These students, now living their dreams, exude satisfaction beyond gratitude towards Edoofa, attending classes confidently and garnering praise from peers. Mr. Angad shares insights from his Africa visit, identifying high-potential individuals aligned with Edoofa's vision. He underscores the importance of an open-minded, resilient attitude, illustrated by an anecdote about Steve Jobs' resourcefulness.  The video emphasizes the significance of following instructions and maintaining openness as Edoofians embark on their journey. You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent.
233 - 08 Mar 2024 03:56PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s vision for you:* In the second video, the founders elaborate on Edoofa's vision, plans, and goals tailored for students, emphasizing the importance of an open-minded approach. He recounts a poignant story of a Ghanaian student who faced obstacles in pursuit of higher education, shedding light on the challenges many encounter in navigating the system.  Despite setbacks, Edoofa stands as a beacon of support, offering scholarships, affordable education, and an ""Earn While You Learn"" initiative, exemplified by Tiriwashe's scholarship credits covering his semester tuition. Success requires more than past grades; it demands a positive attitude, adherence to protocols, and openness to guidance. He encourages students to comprehend and embrace the guidance provided by Edoofa, transforming one's capacity for success from a cup to a tank in the vast ocean of opportunities.
234 - 08 Mar 2024 03:56PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program:* In the third video, the founders emphasize the importance of watching the videos as preparation for Step 5 of the Edoofa Cycle, the University Interaction. He unveils the behind-the-scenes effort, highlighting ten years of hard work invested in creating robust systems and platforms to support student success. Despite only seeing the tip of the iceberg, students benefit from a wealth of resources aimed at helping them excel academically and achieve their dreams.  Additionally, they assure students of Edoofa's commitment to ethical university selection, prioritizing accreditation, faculty qualifications, and English-language instruction to ensure a quality educational experience. Moreover, he stresses the importance of employability, noting the inclusion of the ""Earn While You Learn"" program to provide practical skills alongside academic knowledge, ultimately preparing students for success in their future careers.
235 - 08 Mar 2024 03:56PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP:* In the fourth video, the founders talk about how Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based.  Additionally, the founders delve into the significance of the Statement of Purpose (SOP) in the admissions process, emphasizing its role as a personalized narrative showcasing students' skills, accomplishments, and ambitions. The SOP serves as a platform for students to articulate their motivations for pursuing a specific course, their aspirations for admission, and the unique contributions they can offer to the institution. Through these insights, students are equipped to present themselves as well-rounded individuals with a clear vision for their academic and professional journey.
236 - 08 Mar 2024 03:56PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now once you are able to go through these summaries of the videos, we will have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*.

276 - 08 Mar 2024 03:17PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that. Also, regarding the discussion we had yesterday about the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan, I wanted to follow up on our last conversation. Have you, as a family, been able to discuss it? If so, I would like to understand how the discussion went. What were their thoughts about it? Did they have any specific queries or concerns that you would like us to address?
277 - 08 Mar 2024 03:23PM - +263 77 336 0264: We haven't discussed because we are not together and we couldn't do it over the phone because of network problems.But my question is,are we free as a family to just invest our money outside Edoofa plan
278 - 08 Mar 2024 03:40PM - Sidhi Edoofa: The Edoofa Financial Secure Plan is an optional program designed to offer stable and consistent financial planning for our students and parents. As mentioned earlier, a considerable number of students have faced challenges in securing their scholarship seats due to inadequate financial planning and projection.
279 - 08 Mar 2024 03:40PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Our goal is to provide stability and reliability through the Financial Secure Plan, ensuring students avoid last-minute stress or challenges when securing their scholarship seats. We also provide benefits such as the $150 waiver and the compounding bonus to address the challenges of the Zimbabwean economy. With the Financial Secure Plan, we want to ensure that students enrolled in the plan are able to maximise their savings.
280 - 08 Mar 2024 03:44PM - +263 77 336 0264: I understand but I would rather prefer to have our savings outside Edoofa
281 - 08 Mar 2024 03:57PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand ma'am, that is completely alright. Could you kindly share the reason behind this decision so that we are on the same page here?
282 - 08 Mar 2024 04:11PM - +263 77 336 0264: It's like in the mean time we don't have any money to spare because Tinotenda and her sister are both still at school and they need fees which makes it very difficult for us to have some spare savings

283 - 08 Mar 2024 04:33PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is completely understandable ma'am. However, it's crucial to note that since Tinotenda's profile will be processed under early applications in August 2024, your registration fees, which range from $500 to $1000, will be due during that month. This is to ensure that we can secure a scholarship seat in the best university promptly. May I know if you have taken this into account, and have a plan in mind to save this amount within the specified timeframe?specified timeframe?
284 - 08 Mar 2024 04:52PM - +263 77 336 0264: Can one secure a seat at a University before A Level results
285 - 08 Mar 2024 05:02PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Yes, ma'am. Based on Tinotenda's O-Level results, a verified statement of your A-Level courses (letter of recommendation or statement of entry), a statement of purpose, and an overall evaluation of your application profile, you can secure a scholarship seat as an Edoofian. Once the A-Level results are released, a re-evaluation of the application profile is conducted to ensure that the student meets the minimum requirements in the A-Level examinations. Upon re-evaluation, the student receives an acceptance letter from the university. Does this provide you with a clearer understanding of the process, ma'am? <This message was edited>
286 - 08 Mar 2024 05:13PM - +263 77 336 0264: What about if the student did not perform very well at O level results but will then perform extremely well at A Level, would that not be a disadvantage if his O level results are considered first
287 - 08 Mar 2024 05:13PM - +263 77 336 0264: Isn't it possible for one to wait until the A Level results are out

288 - 08 Mar 2024 05:24PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Based on the re-evaluation of a student's application after the A-Level results are released, the universities go through the same and re-evaluate the student's scholarship quantum as well. If a student performs much better in their A-Level examination, he/she can be offered a higher scholarship quantum as well. <This message was edited>
289 - 08 Mar 2024 05:31PM - +263 77 336 0264: What about if we fail to get the money by August, wouldn't he be considered after exams
290 - 08 Mar 2024 05:57PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Your application will be considered later. However, early applications hold significance because scholarship seats are limited. Starting the application process in August ensures that students have a chance to secure seats before they're filled. Even if a student doesn't perform well in their A-Level exams, processing under early applications increases their chances of securing at least a 50% scholarship seat. You have taken a step in the right direction by enrolling Tinotenda into Edoofa, and we will help you to ensure that you are able to gather the required finances.",No,No

To emphasize  *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and has been rewarding meritorious students to lower their Fee Structure less than what you will end up paying at the Local Zimbabwe University.

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics.   Qualification to the ESAT Exam (Please note EDOOFA calculates your results based on the TOP performers' Score so it is the percentile that we will be evaluating on) A Level and Previous Results *Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. *Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling.  Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these Four  significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?

16 - 08 Mar 2024 10:06AM - Arshita: Dear Parent and Student, we understand you have gone through the Brochures and Flyers of the Edoofa Program. To emphasize  *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and has been rewarding meritorious students to lower their Fee Structure less than what you will end up paying at the Local Zimbabwe University.
17 - 08 Mar 2024 10:06AM - Arshita: Okay so Cornelius, as we start discussing your results further, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship.  In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics.   Qualification to the ESAT Exam (Please note EDOOFA calculates your results based on the TOP performers' Score so it is the percentile that we will be evaluating on) A Level and Previous Results *Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. *Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling.  Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these Four  significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?

I would like to know her better as a student, so please go ahead, and tell me a bit about her, her education, what her wish to study, her strengths, her weaknesses, her hobbies, and a detailed description of her family background, *Where do her parents work (Place) in the country or any other country that they have relocated to due to work promises?

21 - 08 Mar 2024 11:33AM - +263 77 626 6269: Well, currently Fortunate Chuma is doing her A level, lower 6, at Martin Luther. She grabbed the opportunity to register with the Edoofa family when the opportunity knocked.  Fortunate Chuma wrote her Ordinary level last year and passed 7 subjects. She is naturally bended towards Arts subject as is shown by her O level results. Besides, she is intrinsically motivated towards Arts subjects as she enjoys the study area, which she happens to be doing at A level. She is passionate about being a lawyer one day and any material and guidance towards this effect is essential.  Born in Nyanga in 2005, Fortunate was not treated by the best of circumstances. Her parents separated when she was still an infant. It is her hardwork and resilience that has brought her this far.  Interestingly she came to Harare to stay with her brother in 2020. Her brother immediately took her guardianship to this day and with the help of her mother, he has made sure that she attends school.  I happen to be the brother. I work as a teacher here in Harare.  So generally that is the summary of her life

46 - 08 Mar 2024 03:05PM - Arshita: Let me brief you that, I want to brief you that the criteria before the pandemic was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is *a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*  Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.
47 - 08 Mar 2024 03:09PM - +263 78 912 7961: Im totally confident about achieving it

80 - 08 Mar 2024 10:20AM - Arshita: Great, Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, a few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :  *1. Expert Career Counselling:* We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counsellors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.  *2. Affordability through guaranteed scholarships:* Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off.  *3. Earn While You Learn:* The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing our students for the real world.  *4.Higher Education Concierge:* A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.*  After going through these facts that make Edoofa different, which one out of the 4 did you feel is the most significant?
81 - 08 Mar 2024 10:23AM - +263 78 847 2932: The third-party
82 - 08 Mar 2024 10:23AM - Arshita: Can you please elaborate?
122 - 08 Mar 2024 11:17AM - Arshita: *Step 5* After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by making a payment of the registration fee within a few weeks.
123 - 08 Mar 2024 11:17AM - Arshita: This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself and after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).
124 - 08 Mar 2024 11:17AM - Arshita: *Step 6:* Once you are done with the registration fee payment, you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.
125 - 08 Mar 2024 11:17AM - Arshita: I hope you are clear with the process.

127 - 08 Mar 2024 08:05PM - Arshita: We have come to the end of your counselling session. Before I guide you Step 2 of the Eligibility Check, I want you to have a full-fledged discussion of the Edoofa program within your family as higher education is supposed to be a family decision. Ensure to include these aspects during the discussions:-  *About the EDOOFA Program and its vision of making Education Affordable and Edoofians Employment Ready.* *Value of the career of an Edoofian after pursuing higher education in India.* *The financial aspects and how Edoofa brings in affordability and self-financing opportunities for students.*
128 - 08 Mar 2024 08:05PM - Arshita: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences,  *Edoofa’s Website- www.edoofa.com* *Pictures (Edoofians from Africa studying in India): https://tinyurl.com/3ke35s35*  *Please ensure to go through the FAQ document before the next stage and refer the same to your family as it has answers to most of the queries.* Furthermore, if you have any other queries I would suggest that you note them down and we will discuss them in the next session.  Let me also share a few pictures of the students who are studying in India through the Edoofa Program so that you can witness the exposures and their experiences.

17 - 08 Mar 2024 10:02AM - Arshita: Dear Parent and Student, we understand you have gone through the Brochures and Flyers of the Edoofa Program. To emphasize  *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and has been rewarding meritorious students to lower their Fee Structure less than what you will end up paying at the Local Zimbabwe University.
18 - 08 Mar 2024 10:02AM - Arshita: Okay so Leona, as we start discussing your results further, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship.  In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics.   Qualification to the ESAT Exam (Please note EDOOFA calculates your results based on the TOP performers' Score so it is the percentile that we will be evaluating on) A Level and Previous Results *Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. *Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling.  Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these Four  significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?

150 - 08 Mar 2024 12:56PM - Garima Edoofa: May I know if your parents have gone through the letter too? and if yes are there any questions that you want to ask regarding the same?
151 - 08 Mar 2024 12:57PM - +263 78 233 9757: My parents went through it as well and they were happy about it
152 - 08 Mar 2024 12:58PM - +263 78 233 9757: Rather l have a few questions regarding the percentage of the scholarship ranging from 60-100% l need to know the precise range
153 - 08 Mar 2024 01:24PM - Garima Edoofa: I wish to inform you that the scholarship you have been awarded falls within the range of 60% to 100%. The exact percentage of the scholarship will be determined once you are enrolled in the program and your university selection is finalized. As outlined in the scholarship letter, the initial estimated cost was between $2000 and $3000. However, upon careful review, the actual cost is stated as $1600 to $2300. Once the university selection process is completed, you will receive the precise scholarship amount.
154 - 08 Mar 2024 01:24PM - Garima Edoofa: however since you must have seen, there are two modes of fee payments mentioned:-  1. Direct Bank Transfer to our Parent Company's account 2. Deposit in our associate's account over there in Zimbabwe  Which mode according to you would be convenient, so that I can brief you in-depth about that particular mode?
155 - 08 Mar 2024 01:25PM - +263 78 233 9757: 2
156 - 08 Mar 2024 01:31PM - Garima Edoofa: @263782339757 basically you see in the first mode, the Direct Bank Transfer Mode, the transfer charges which are to be borne by the parents of the student ranges between $100 to $120 which become quite high for a lot of parents considering the economic situation in Zimbabwe itself. So as not every student is in a position to cater for an additional $100 to $120 just as transfer charge, the second mode was introduced, wherein, it is the Bank deposit in Mr. Charles's Account, in this the transfer charges get divided amongst 10 students resulting in an equivalent bearing of 12.5% at the end.  So as you can see in the letter that there is a Bank deposit in, Mr. Charles Jerera (Retired Education Officer)'s account as he is our Associated Partner there in Zimbabwe, Since 2020 there have been over 1400+ students who have been assisted by Mr Charles inorder to complete their enrollment formalities as well as university fee payments after arriving in India.
157 - 08 Mar 2024 01:32PM - Garima Edoofa: Therefore the fee can also be paid through him. Since his account is a NOSTRO Account which only holds USD itself, therefore the necessary amount including the transfer charges in this mode itself would be $394 ($350 + $44 transfer charges), and the same details are as below:-  BANK NAME: FBC  SWIFT CODE: FBCPZWHA  ACC NAME: CHARLES JERERA  ACC NUMBER: 5333038014048828  CONTACT NUMBER: +263 77 376 9854",No,No

To emphasize  *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation.

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics.   Qualification to the ESAT Exam (Please note EDOOFA calculates your results based on the TOP performers' Score so it is the percentile that we will be evaluating on) A Level and Previous Results *Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. *Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling. Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these Four  significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?

11 - 08 Mar 2024 12:35PM - Gurvinder: Dear Parent and Student, we understand you have gone through the Brochures and Flyers of the Edoofa Program. To emphasize  *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and has been rewarding meritorious students to lower their Fee Structure less than what you will end up paying at the Local Zimbabwe University.
12 - 08 Mar 2024 01:39PM - +263 71 583 8183: Yes we have gone through the fliers
13 - 08 Mar 2024 01:40PM - Gurvinder: Okay so Praise, as we start discussing your results further, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship.  In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics.   Qualification to the ESAT Exam (Please note EDOOFA calculates your results based on the TOP performers' Score so it is the percentile that we will be evaluating on) A Level and Previous Results *Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. *Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling. Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these Four  significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?

16 - 08 Mar 2024 01:45PM - Gurvinder: Now Praise, I would like to know you better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about yourself, your career aspiration do include sharing about:-  1. Your highest education level? 2. The course you would like to study? 3. What do your parents do? 4. What is your parent’s highest education level? 5. Who has been supporting you for your Education so far? 6.

114 - 08 Mar 2024 06:36PM - Harmehak: Step 5: After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities.  August 2025 intake, applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from the Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.  This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 instalments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.
115 - 08 Mar 2024 06:36PM - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
116 - 08 Mar 2024 06:38PM - +263 77 476 2203: Yes I do
117 - 08 Mar 2024 07:03PM - Harmehak: Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.

She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.  Have a look at her daughter's video as well.

16 - 08 Mar 2024 11:15AM - Keshav Edoofa: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*  One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
17 - 08 Mar 2024 11:15AM - Keshav Edoofa: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*

51 - 08 Mar 2024 01:38PM - Keshav Edoofa: @263783848985 , if you would have researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*.

20 - 08 Mar 2024 11:24AM - Keshav Edoofa: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*  One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!

41 - 08 Mar 2024 12:03PM - +263 78 293 0149: I Kunashe Buzuzi as a student who recently completed his A level education at Marondera high school i find myself to be a young man who is greatly motivated by find challenges and finding solutions to them ,also it really makes me feel great creating somethings of my own which would not only benefit me but also my family and community. I have more interest in the business field and i would love to do the bachelors degree in Business Adminstration.  Some of my strengths is that i am a good and patient communicater who is also good in working with a team. I have figured out that working with others towards a goal is also one of my greatest motivators. Then when it comes to weaknesses i wouldnt really say it is a weakness for me but i hate to be surrounded by people with negative minds or negative energy which would be a source of demotivation for the others . My hobbies are rugby and basketball. Also i really enjoy socialising with peers ,i find it to be one of the things i enjoy the most. I come from a middle earning family and cureently my one parent that i have is currently not employed due to a few challenges but his former occupation he worked as a transporter.  I think this is all the information i have.Fell free to ask if there is anything else you would need to know
42 - 08 Mar 2024 01:34PM - Keshav Edoofa: I really appreciate how sincere you were in expressing yourself, Kunashe. I have confidence that you are an exceptionally diligent student, and you will undoubtedly demonstrate your capabilities if given the right guidance!

50 - 08 Mar 2024 11:22AM - Keshav Edoofa: But you see, Mining engineering is a field of engineering that is concerned with the extraction and processing of minerals from the earth. It is a field that has been around for centuries and is currently experiencing a resurgence due to the increased demand for materials such as metals, minerals, and oil. However, due to the changing nature of the world’s economy, it is unclear whether mining engineering will remain a viable field of study and profession 10 years down the line.  One of the primary reasons why mining engineering may not be successful 10 years down the line is the increasing shift towards renewable energy sources. With the world’s reliance on fossil fuels decreasing, there is less need for the materials that mining engineers specialize in extracting and processing. Furthermore, the increasing focus on environmental conservation has also contributed to this shift, as the extraction of minerals and materials can often have a negative impact on the environment.  In addition, the advancement of technology in other engineering fields such as computer science and mechanical engineering may also lead to the decreased relevance of mining engineering. As technology improves, these other fields are becoming more efficient and effective in the development of new products and services. This increased efficiency and effectiveness can lead to a decrease in the demand for materials that are extracted and processed by mining engineers.  Finally, the increasing cost of labor may also be a factor in the decreased relevance of mining engineering 10 years down the line. As the cost of labor increases, it becomes more difficult for mining companies to remain profitable. This can lead to mining companies cutting back on labor costs, which can reduce the demand for mining engineers and other professionals in the field.  In conclusion, mining engineering may not be successful 10 years down the line due to the increasing shift towards renewable energy sources, the advancement of technology in other engineering fields, and the increasing cost of labor. As a result, mining engineers may need to look for other opportunities in order to remain relevant and successful in the future.
51 - 08 Mar 2024 11:55AM - +263 78 347 6488: l understand stand Mr Keshav and thanks for the information. ln that case my first alternative would be to study environmental engineering
55 - 08 Mar 2024 12:18PM - +263 78 347 6488: oh yes it is😅
56 - 08 Mar 2024 12:22PM - Keshav Edoofa: So in such a scenario globally electrical engineering and electronics engineering are going to boom and flourish as from my experience in the education field for so many years I can confidently say environmental, mining, metallurgical engineering etc are going to be replaced by engineering branches like electrical, electronics, computer science, mechanical in terms of scope and opportunities!  Dont you agree with me?
57 - 08 Mar 2024 03:30PM - +263 78 347 6488: oh l do agree with you sir

Cost of food, even if you consider a simple meal of sadza and chicken curry that costs $1, so $1 a meal and 3 meals a day that is $3 a day, which means almost $1200 a year. 4. Miscellaneous expenses such as travel, internet easily cost $40-$50 a month meaning $600 a year.  All in all cost of studying at locally in Zimbabwe is be around $4000-$4800 a year!

43 mins","180 - 07 Mar 2024 03:55PM - Pallika Edoofa: *Bachelor of Design [B.Des]* in Communication Design is a 4-year full time undergraduate course. The programme is divided into 8 semesters of six months each.  Graphic Design is a specialised branch of communication design, and candidates wishing to specialise in this need to start out with a degree in communication design, which would allow them to specialise in graphic design after second year. The course is best suited for those who are interested in seeking a career in anything from marketing companies to government agencies.  Having a bachelors in communication design opens the gateway to being a graphic artist, merchandiser, creative director or website designer. One may work in industries including media, public relations, communications, education and business.  Projects in this line of work include customized web-design for various merchandisers, creating advertisements for small businesses, developing magazine layouts or graphic designing for video games among other things. Some standard skills required for the aforementioned careers include creativity, knowledge of design techniques, familiarity with various multimedia and other relevant technical skills. Any design course fundamentally caters to those creatively inclined and left-brain oriented, equipping them with the necessary skills to make a career out of essentially thinking outside the box.  *What is it about?*  The program has been designed to offer the eligible students a course that concentrates on the conceptualisation, ‘design’, and execution of an idea. It can range from an advertisement to a movie, anything at all which needs to be graphically designed, the technology and software’s associated with it. The study of the course includes subjects like typography, colour theory, and layout theory. A B.Des degree in Graphic introduces a student to the industry of graphic design, understanding its history and its future, and to the technology and equipment required to design something. It focuses on the principles of design such as balance, contrast, movement and rhythm, etc., on typography, creating images for web and print, editing images, and ultimately leadership skills required to lead a team with your idea in this industry.  This line of design is growing relevance in contemporary times. Everything today from education to markets of all types have now gained either a secondary digital presence, or operate solely in the digital space. Not only has digitization allowed producers to find wider markets but also allowed niche producers to find consumers that fit their specific demographic. Digitisation has eliminated, in various cases, costs associated with commute and thus made web-designing and digital branding critical to commerce today. Thus graduates in graphic design definitely are fit for the current ‘virtual market’ age. In fact, they have become quite indispensable in almost all industries today.  To sustain in this field one must be equipped with exceptional analytical skills and consumer insight to cater designs to consumer sensibility as well as the client’s brand image. Their artistic ability must undoubtedly be of a high grade and they should have the computer skills to translate their art into a graphic design, with a strong sense of creativity. They must be able communicators so they can understand the client’s needs and communicate his or her vision, as well as be good at time management since in this field an employee is required to work on multiple projects at the same time.  *Career Prospects*  Bachelors of Design in Communication Design graduates may have job opportunities both in the private and the government sector due to changing nature of the economy in this digital age. Today everything is seen through a web interface, exists solely on a web interface, or expands through a web interface. Furthermore, advertising campaigns and branding have become exceedingly digitized and much more intricate in design. Thus graduates in this course have a plethora of job opportunities on offer. Manufacturing units, marketing agencies, fashion media, boutiques, hotels, etc. are examples of the various private sector enterprises that hire graphic design graduates. Job profiles for both these sectors includes graphic designers that are concerned with the conceptualization, sketching, and creation of designs keeping in mind the needs of the clients and consumer susceptibility. Similarly Web designers are occupied with the creation of websites, and more specialized job profiles in this field include interaction designers, communications designers, service designers, and etc.  The market today is perfect for a graphic design graduate considering their need across multiple industries. Most business and enterprises today, as well as government agencies require designers in order to make them accessible in this age of marketing and digitization.

185 - 08 Mar 2024 09:43AM - Pallika Edoofa: Greetings!  *“The only way to have a life is to commit to it like crazy.”*  On this positive note, shall we begin with your session?
186 - 08 Mar 2024 10:09AM - +27 63 427 2451: Yes
187 - 08 Mar 2024 10:12AM - Pallika Edoofa: How are you?
188 - 08 Mar 2024 10:12AM - Pallika Edoofa: So, are you willing to pursue this course?
189 - 08 Mar 2024 10:44AM - +27 63 427 2451: Yes
196 - 08 Mar 2024 12:30PM - Pallika Edoofa: Also, That is amazing, As I can see, you have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead.  *By any chance are you familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship?*
197 - 08 Mar 2024 12:37PM - +27 63 427 2451: I might not be familiar but I can definitely help with that. To estimate the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship, I can consider factors such as tuition fees, living expenses, and other related costs. Tuition fees for international students can vary widely depending on the country and specific institution. Additionally, living expenses such as accommodation, food, transportation, and other personal costs should also be taken into account. It's important to research specific universities and their respective cost estimates to obtain a more accurate picture of the total expenses involved.
198 - 08 Mar 2024 12:41PM - Pallika Edoofa: That’s alright, Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India compared to other global hubs.  In India, international students face an average expense of *$6000-$8000 annually.* While this is very low as compared to the Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc where the cost of education ranges from $15000-$35000 annually, it is still beyond the reach of many.  With the Edoofa Scholarship Program, the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000 per annum* for the students who are found eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility Check Process. This reduced cost includes: *1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)* *2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Laundry, etc.)* *3. Food* *4. Accommodation*

202 - 08 Mar 2024 02:47PM - Pallika Edoofa: Good to know, So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians. Looking at this cost of education as well, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits which can help in reducing their fees further.  Do you know how that is done?
203 - 08 Mar 2024 03:03PM - +27 63 427 2451: I don't think I know, please explain further
204 - 08 Mar 2024 03:04PM - Pallika Edoofa: That’s alright, Let me tell you how Edoofa helps Edoofians bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the *Earn While You Learn Program*  The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that are equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.The Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.  The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies and needs, converting an Individual into a market-ready professional. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
205 - 08 Mar 2024 03:04PM - Pallika Edoofa: *Projects with Brands and Companies: -* The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, such as: *Africa Global Radio-* The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project and hear from the CEO about the exposures of the Edoofa program. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4DAP24ZuY4&authuser=0 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0 *Skooqs-* This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.  *Recruitment Partners:-* Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:- Nigenuis Skooqs Success Magazine TIA Organics  *Webinars:-* We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars regularly with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: - -Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade. -How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi -How to be industry-ready before graduating?

169 - 08 Mar 2024 01:34PM - Pallika Edoofa: The enrollment fee is to be paid only if a child is found eligible for the Edoofa Scholarship Program after passing the eligibility check stage, it includes,  *Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team* *Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities* *Earn While You Learn Program and training* *University sessions and selection* *A guaranteed scholarship seat* *Visa Documentation Assistance* *The Foster and Care throughout the course of an Edoofian*
170 - 08 Mar 2024 01:34PM - Pallika Edoofa: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge due to which parents might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short period of 7 days and for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option wherein if the student is found eligible, instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, *parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days thereby reducing the financial pressure.*

210 - 08 Mar 2024 12:28PM - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 5:* After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities.  August 2025 intake applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.  This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 instalments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.
211 - 08 Mar 2024 12:28PM - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 6 :* Once you are done with the registration fee payment, you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.  I hope you are clear with the process.

194 - 08 Mar 2024 11:05AM - Shubham Madhwal: *@263774319470* Please note that the number of scholarship seats is limited in number, and in case *Dephine* is selected for the scholarship we expect that you are clear and aware of all the details shared during the session along with that you also obey the rules and honour the scholarship terms.  In case you do not follow these terms then *Dephine's* entire scholarship process will go into backlog and you will only be able to apply for the scholarship after 6 months. By then the entire fee structure for the scholarship program may increase*.
195 - 08 Mar 2024 11:05AM - Shubham Madhwal: Ideally, as you know, the tentative dates are: 1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the *15th or 16th of March 2024* for $200 and the *15th or 16th of April 2024* for the remaining $150.  2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the *15th or 16th of March 2024*  Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?
