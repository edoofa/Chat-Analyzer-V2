01/12/23, 12:31 pm - Arshita: Do you have any past experience of learning in the field of biotechnology?
01/12/23, 12:40 pm - +263 77 233 3752: I don't have
01/12/23, 12:41 pm - Arshita: That is fine. 

To take your evaluation forward can you please share your O level and A level results? 

Pictures will be better
01/12/23, 12:43 pm - +263 77 233 3752: A level results are not yet out
01/12/23, 12:44 pm - +263 77 233 3752: O level is it possible if l sent later the picture because l am not home at the moment
01/12/23, 12:52 pm - Arshita: That is well noted.
01/12/23, 12:52 pm - Arshita: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is 2 A level passes, we always encourage our students to aim for maximum so that they get a higher quantum of scholarship. 

I hope you are confident about achieving it.
01/12/23, 1:04 pm - +263 77 233 3752: Its okay,noted
01/12/23, 1:05 pm - Arshita: As your evaluation progress, I would like to appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country. In this process did you make any prior research on foreign education or applied to any University abroad?
01/12/23, 1:27 pm - +263 77 233 3752: No I didnt research
No i didnt apply
01/12/23, 2:04 pm - Arshita: I understand ! 
Foreign education is just one challenge in this challenging world. I hope you agree that the major problem that the youth is facing is employability.
We want you to understand the difference between a Scholarship Program that has an end goal of making you individually employment-ready, and agents luring you for University Admissions abroad.
Let me share an article that is part of an awareness initiative for students interested in Studying Abroad.
01/12/23, 2:04 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
01/12/23, 2:04 pm - Arshita: Let me know once you are done
01/12/23, 2:26 pm - +263 77 233 3752: Im done
01/12/23, 2:27 pm - Arshita: Can you please confirm me your subjects in A level ?
01/12/23, 2:28 pm - +263 77 233 3752: Pure Maths 
Biology 
Crop science
01/12/23, 2:38 pm - Arshita: With your interest in engineering why didn't you opt for engineering at A level?
01/12/23, 2:40 pm - +263 77 233 3752: My school didnt offer it
01/12/23, 2:59 pm - Arshita: That is well noted
01/12/23, 2:59 pm - Arshita: Since Medical Education and Engineering are two aspects for which the Indian Education System is known, both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level: Physics, Chemistry, and Biology. If they want to study any Engineering Course, they should have Physics and Mathematics at their A level mandatorily.
01/12/23, 3:00 pm - Arshita: Since you do not have physics , you are not eligible for engineering. 

At the same time do you have any alternate career aspirations?
01/12/23, 3:04 pm - +263 77 233 3752: This message was deleted
01/12/23, 3:13 pm - +263 77 233 3752: No 
But do you have any suggestions
01/12/23, 3:19 pm - Arshita: May I know is there any particular field that you are interested?
01/12/23, 3:27 pm - +263 77 233 3752: Biology
01/12/23, 3:34 pm - Arshita: That is well noted.
01/12/23, 3:35 pm - +263 77 233 3752: Okay
01/12/23, 3:36 pm - Arshita: Since you are not having Physics and Chemistry, I regret to inform you that you are not eligible for Medicine, but considering your interest there are better courses from Medical Field itself that you are eligible for and which can help fulfil your dreams of working in this field

*Physiotherapy*

*Bachelor of Science in Cardiovascular Technology*

01/12/23, 4:36 pm - +263 77 233 3752: Working on my career as a physiotherapist as I would have completed my studies with your help
01/12/23, 4:36 pm - Arshita: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career.I believe you will be researching more about the course in detail.
 
So now as you know Edoofa Recommends India as a Higher Education Platform
May I know what is your knowledge or what have you researched about India and the Indian Education System?
01/12/23, 4:43 pm - +263 77 233 3752: The system has four levels lower primary upper primary and high to higher secondary  
The best education in india is Kerala
01/12/23, 4:44 pm - Arshita: Good to know about your knowledge
01/12/23, 4:44 pm - Arshita: Let me tell you why Edoofa recommends India for higher education.
01/12/23, 4:44 pm - Arshita: *1. It’s Home to the World’s Second-Largest Higher Education System*- The Indian Education system is the world's second largest Higher Education System with more than 1000+ universities, 39,931 colleges and a capacity of enrolling more than a whopping 20 million students. Higher Education Institutions in India offer courses/degrees that are competitive in the world market in terms of quality but are delivered at one fourth the cost, hence guaranteeing value-for-money education and has led to a robust placement oriented education as about 200 of the Fortune 500 companies hire regularly from Indian campuses.
01/12/23, 4:44 pm - Arshita: *2. Its Universities Are Well-Ranked and Climbing*- From politics/law to philosophy and biology to business and media/journalism there’s something for everyone in India’s massive higher education system. Indian education ranges from exposure to the latest advancements of science and technology like Virtual and Augmented Reality, Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive Computing to Yoga, Ayurveda, Sanskrit and classical dances.
01/12/23, 4:44 pm - Arshita: *3. It’ Affordable*- Compared to many of the world’s finest institutions, India’s low cost of education is a bargain. Additionally, various scholarships, loans, and financial schemes are available to offset the cost.
01/12/23, 4:44 pm - Arshita: *4. It’s the fastest growing Economy in the World*- India’s economy continues to surge. Not only do experts predict that it will be the world’s third-largest economy by 2030.India is also well known for Comprehensive Tax System,Business Friendly Laws,Low Operational Costs for Corporates and Industries,Vast trade Network,International Alliances and Work Ethics
01/12/23, 4:44 pm - Arshita: *5.Global Recognition of Indian Education*- Did you know that the CEOs of Google, Microsoft,IBM,Adobe are all Indians? 18 % of doctors in the US are Indians, as are 36 % of the scientists at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) are Indians and 34 % of Microsoft employees are Indians as well, all of this is possible because of the education system in India.
01/12/23, 4:44 pm - Arshita: *6 Cultural Harmony and inclusiveness*- India is a country with diversities in Caste,creed,colour,culture,costume,convictions and cuisines.People come from different backgrounds and there is a Unity in this Diversity that makes India Unique. India ranks second in terms of the Number of English Speaking people in the world making India the most preferred destination for higher education for International Students
01/12/23, 4:44 pm - Arshita: Let me also show you some facts about India and global leaders who are the product of Indian Education.
01/12/23, 4:44 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>

01/12/23, 4:44 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
01/12/23, 4:47 pm - +263 77 233 3752: Okay
01/12/23, 4:49 pm - Arshita: Well I am sure after seeing all these amazing facts, you are intrigued to study in India.So can you now tell me,How would studying in India implement a positive impact on your career and How do you aim to achieve your career aspirations by studying in India?
01/12/23, 4:54 pm - +263 77 233 3752: I believe studying in Indian will help me have a career I can never have in Zimbabwe
01/12/23, 4:56 pm - Arshita: As I can see,you have understood the quality of higher education which Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead.

By any chance are you familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship?
01/12/23, 5:00 pm - +263 77 233 3752: No I am not familiar
01/12/23, 5:03 pm - Arshita: Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth! 

In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc,it is still beyond the reach of many.
With the Edoofa Scholarship Program,the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library,Wifi,Laundry,etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
01/12/23, 5:04 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
01/12/23, 5:04 pm - Arshita: Looking at the reduced cost of education, do you feel it is affordable to your family?
01/12/23, 5:11 pm - +263 77 233 3752: It isnt affordable
01/12/23, 5:13 pm - Arshita: I can understand that! 

So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians.Looking at this cost of education also, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits and which can help you in reducing their fees further.

And do you know how that is done?
01/12/23, 5:15 pm - +263 77 233 3752: No I do not
01/12/23, 6:07 pm - Arshita: Let me tell you how Edoofa helps Edoofians bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the
*Earn While You Learn Program*
01/12/23, 6:07 pm - Arshita: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
 Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.
01/12/23, 6:07 pm - Arshita: The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
01/12/23, 6:07 pm - Arshita: *Projects with Brands and Companies:* -
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:
Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.
Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
01/12/23, 6:07 pm - Arshita: *Recruitment Partners:* -
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics
These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.
These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases.

How are you doing?
04/12/23, 2:19 pm - +263 77 233 3752: I am fine
04/12/23, 2:19 pm - +263 77 233 3752: Hw are you
04/12/23, 2:52 pm - Arshita: Good to hear that! 

I am doing well , thank you!

04/12/23, 4:01 pm - +263 77 233 3752: Yes if work is manageable
04/12/23, 4:19 pm - Arshita: If I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $3000 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1800 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $150-$180 a month.
 
*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly*
04/12/23, 4:19 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
04/12/23, 4:33 pm - +263 77 233 3752: Okay
04/12/23, 4:35 pm - Arshita: Great,Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :
04/12/23, 4:35 pm - Arshita: *1. Expert Career Counselling*: We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counselors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.
04/12/23, 4:35 pm - Arshita: *2. Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off
04/12/23, 4:35 pm - Arshita: *3. Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. Whats more, students earn
04/12/23, 4:35 pm - Arshita: *4 Higher Education Concierge*: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.
04/12/23, 4:35 pm - Arshita: So after going through the facts that make Edoofa different,
Let me know which point out of the 4 you like the most.
04/12/23, 5:18 pm - +263 77 233 3752: Expert Career Counselling

*“Experience is not what happens to you; it is what you do with what happens to you.”*

On this positive note, shall we begin with your session?
05/12/23, 1:54 pm - +263 77 233 3752: How are you?
05/12/23, 1:54 pm - +263 77 233 3752: We can begin
05/12/23, 1:55 pm - Arshita: Greetings! 
I am doing well, thank you! 

How are you doing?
05/12/23, 2:03 pm - +263 77 233 3752: I am fine
05/12/23, 2:05 pm - Arshita: Good to hear that!
05/12/23, 2:05 pm - Arshita: There is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it depends upon his/her hard work.
However, may I know, who will be helping you with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
05/12/23, 2:14 pm - Arshita: Please answer this
05/12/23, 2:22 pm - +263 77 233 3752: My mother
05/12/23, 2:22 pm - Arshita: That's completely understandable,

So I believe you'll be discussing everything with her after we complete today's session. Also after our counselling session, I would connect to some of our Beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know the proceedings well.
So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
05/12/23, 2:28 pm - Arshita: Please answer this
05/12/23, 3:50 pm - +263 77 233 3752: They don't mind as long as the funds permits
05/12/23, 3:51 pm - Arshita: Good to hear that!
05/12/23, 3:51 pm - Arshita: studying Internationally would make your career advance at an even greater pace, as you will be transformed into a professional with a Greater Paying Job, which would actually help you in uplifting your family there by yourself, and provide a peaceful and hassle-free life to your parents.
05/12/23, 3:51 pm - Arshita: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be

*1) Application Form*

*2) Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

*3) Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university, isn't it?
05/12/23, 4:03 pm - +263 77 233 3752: Thats great
05/12/23, 4:03 pm - +263 77 233 3752: Yes
05/12/23, 4:03 pm - Arshita: *When a student applies alone for an international University* , on an average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose of the students costs higher between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it. 
Now this basically means, for a student to apply to just 5 Universities the average cost incurred by him/her would be* somewhere between $1350-1750 (Application Form + Statement of Purpose). *without even recieving a guarantee to be selected on not*
05/12/23, 4:03 pm - Arshita: And do you know this is one reason which Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurity of what would happen, and just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.
So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create the statement of purpose but also helps you with the *Visa Documentation Assistance,University Selection and sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than $1350-$1750 without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only $750. This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
05/12/23, 4:03 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
05/12/23, 4:04 pm - Arshita: *So shall I sum up, why and when the enrollment fee is paid?*
05/12/23, 7:06 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
06/12/23, 11:31 am - +263 77 233 3752: Today she wont be available

06/12/23, 7:21 pm - Arshita: Let us connect at  *11:30 am CAT on Thursday(07/12/23) to resume your session (In case you have any challenges or lessons, you can let me know and we will plan accordingly)*

Please note that your participation and activeness an important parameters of evaluation. If the applicant is occupied with lessons, parents can initiate on their behalf.

*“Keep your face always toward the sunshine, and shadows will fall behind you.”*

On this positive note, shall we begin with your session?
07/12/23, 5:10 pm - +263 77 233 3752: Sorry for late reply was busy today
07/12/23, 5:10 pm - Arshita: Greetings! 

How are you doing?
07/12/23, 5:13 pm - +263 77 233 3752: I am fine
07/12/23, 5:14 pm - +263 77 233 3752: Is it okay if we can reschedule
07/12/23, 5:19 pm - Arshita: We are just left with 10 minutes of the session. 

Shall we finish today?
07/12/23, 5:22 pm - +263 77 233 3752: Its okay
07/12/23, 5:23 pm - Arshita: So shall I sum up?
07/12/23, 5:34 pm - +263 77 233 3752: Yes
07/12/23, 5:34 pm - Arshita: The enrollment fee is to be paid if a child is found eligible for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, it includes your

-Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team
-Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities
-Earn While You Learn Program and training
-University sessions and interactions
-A guaranteed scholarship seat 
-Visa Documentation Assistance 
-The Foster and Care throughout your course
07/12/23, 5:34 pm - Arshita: However , as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein *if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
07/12/23, 5:44 pm - +263 77 233 3752: Okay
07/12/23, 5:44 pm - Arshita: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process.
 
*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation
If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.
*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).
*Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa , then their final university evaluation and Admission would continued. However if the student wouldn’t have met the necessary requirements as per the university and Edoofa , then the paid $350 will be refunded to the parent.
*Amount of credit earned by the student in phase 2 can be used for the student’s first year’s annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
07/12/23, 5:46 pm - +263 77 233 3752: Okay
07/12/23, 5:48 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
07/12/23, 6:26 pm - +263 77 233 3752: Stage 1
07/12/23, 6:36 pm - Arshita: Though we are still at stage 1 but we have discussed about eligibility, Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.

In Step 1:Connect with a counsellor- As your counselor, now we are going through the counseling process discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

In Step 2:Eligibility Check- The eligibility check includes the interviews with Academic Board and Test

Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa- If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program- This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.

We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
07/12/23, 6:53 pm - +263 77 233 3752: Yes
07/12/23, 6:53 pm - Arshita: *Step 5* After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by making a payment of the registration fee within a few weeks.
07/12/23, 6:53 pm - Arshita: This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself and after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).
07/12/23, 6:53 pm - Arshita: *Step 6:* Once you are done with the registration fee payment, you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.
07/12/23, 6:53 pm - Arshita: I hope you are clear with the process.
07/12/23, 6:57 pm - +263 77 233 3752: Yes
07/12/23, 7:23 pm - Arshita: Alright , we have come to the end of your counselling session, now before I guide you for Step 2 which is the Eligibility Check.
I want you to have a full-fledged discussion about the same with your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family -
*1. About the EDOOFA Program and its vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*
*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*
*3. Also, the financial aspects involved*
*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee if you are found eligible for the program*

18/12/23, 2:45 pm - Arshita: Greetings @263772333752 ! 

How are you doing?
18/12/23, 3:09 pm - +263 77 233 3752: Im alright
18/12/23, 3:12 pm - Arshita: I believe you have been following the sessions on the group regarding the program. What are your thoughts on the Edoofa Scholarship Program and do you have any questions for me, please?
18/12/23, 3:16 pm - +263 77 233 3752: I think that the program helps young people achieve their dreams
18/12/23, 3:16 pm - +263 77 233 3752: So how do we get the scholarship
18/12/23, 3:17 pm - +263 77 233 3752: And what are the points needed at Alevel
18/12/23, 3:18 pm - Arshita: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is 2 A level passes, we always encourage our students to aim for maximum so that they get a higher quantum of scholarship. 

I hope you are confident about achieving it.
18/12/23, 3:43 pm - +263 77 233 3752: Okay

Is there anything you would like to ask me regarding the program now?
18/12/23, 3:44 pm - +263 77 233 3752: No
18/12/23, 3:45 pm - Arshita: This is well noted, 
May I know your thoughts regarding the financial aspects such as enrollment fees and cost of education, please
18/12/23, 3:48 pm - +263 77 233 3752: The enrollment fee is expensive
19/12/23, 8:08 am - Arshita: May I know as per your understanding how much is the enrollment fee?
19/12/23, 11:58 am - +263 77 233 3752: $350
19/12/23, 11:58 am - Arshita: Yes, have you considered the payment plan for the same?
19/12/23, 12:00 pm - +263 77 233 3752: Yes
19/12/23, 12:00 pm - Arshita: May I know as per your understanding what is the payment plan?
19/12/23, 12:01 pm - +263 77 233 3752: Paying in installments
19/12/23, 12:02 pm - Arshita: However , as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein *if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
19/12/23, 12:03 pm - +263 77 233 3752: Ojay
19/12/23, 12:03 pm - +263 77 233 3752: Okay
19/12/23, 12:03 pm - Arshita: Will it be feasible for you?
19/12/23, 12:05 pm - +263 77 233 3752: Will see when the time comes but its challenging
19/12/23, 12:09 pm - Arshita: May I know how much time will you require to raise the same amount?
19/12/23, 12:14 pm - +263 77 233 3752: 4 months
19/12/23, 2:02 pm - Arshita: That would be a long time frame by which the scholarship seats will be fully occupied. 

Will your family be able to assist you here if your child qualifies now?
