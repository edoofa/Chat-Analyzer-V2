12/12/23, 10:29 am - Harmehak: That's great, Nonkosi
12/12/23, 10:29 am - Harmehak: Now, let me share more about the program with you.

You see, *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4000 students from different African countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
12/12/23, 10:29 am - Harmehak: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program. 
We are associated with more than 200 schools in Zimbabwe. Some of the most elite Schools in Zimbabawe example in Harare we are collaborated with St. Dominic’s Chishawasha, Dominican Convent, Christ Ministries and many others. In Manicaland we have a total of 18 Schools to name a few St. David’s Girls Bonda, Hartzell High, First Class, First Choice and so on.  Chipinge we have Chibuwe High School, you would be happy to know that the DEO’s of Mutare and Chipinge have their kids under the Edoofa Scholarship. Masvingo we have 24 Schools collaborated with over 300 students from some of the best schools example Pamushana, St. Antony’s, Reformed Church Gutu, Zaka High and many others. The program is also appreciated by the Education Inspector of Bikita Madam Makomeke.We have more than 500 students from Mashonaland (West, Central and East) Province, Midlands Province.  Last but not the Least we also have Schools from Bulawayo and Matebaland South associated with Edoofa. 

Our collaborations with the UCE College Bulawayo adds a feather to the Cap of trust that Edoofa has built in a span of 14 years. 

The Schools, Institutions and Educationists who have made efforts to train the students for this prestigious Scholarship Program are also the Authorized Designatories of EDOOFA in Zimbabawe. 
We have Mr. Shorwi Kawadza (Retd. Headmaster Hartzell), Mr. Charles Jerera (Retd. Ministry of Education), Ms. Christina Rockson (Founder and Principal of Hilltop Christian College in SA) who have shown relentless efforts to guide students on the right path to success.EDOOFA boasts a proud students and parents community of more than 2000 from Zimbabwe who are happy with the quality of education and the employability outcomes.
12/12/23, 10:34 am - +263 78 896 9497: So what is required for one to be part of your program because it seems like a very good program with nothing but pure intentions of providing education to our young youth
12/12/23, 10:37 am - Harmehak: I shall discuss the entire details in the Counseling session today itself.
12/12/23, 10:37 am - Harmehak: *Alright so Nonkosi, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.*

I would like to know you better as a student so please go ahead, tell me a bit about yourself, your education, along with what do you wish to study, your strengths and weaknesses, and your hobbies, since I honestly don't know a lot about you?

And with that a detailed description of your family background, what do your parents do *(Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work)?*, what is their highest education level along with if you have any siblings, please?
12/12/23, 10:45 am - +263 78 896 9497: Iam Nonkosi Babongile Mdladla
Iam 18 years old.
I come from a family of 3 girls and 2 boys me being the 4th child 
My mum is an entrepreneur she buys and resells goods especially clothes 
Then my dad work in the humanitarian sector he’s a driver at World Vision Zimbabwe and has worked with world vision for over 10 years now
One of my elder sisters is a health care assistant and the other studied Development Studies 
My brother is a waiter then my little brother is still in school 


Academically I would describe myself as a hard worker someone who studies very hard and iam a highly dedicated person . 
I did Maths, Geography and Computer Science hence I wish to be a Software Engineer or Computer Engineeer 
My other passion lies with being a Mining Engineer 
I want to be part of the few percent of women in Engineering
12/12/23, 10:53 am - Harmehak: Well received and well expressed Nonkosi, Its a pleasure to know about you and your family!

I appreciate the honesty and transparency you have shown in expressing yourself!
12/12/23, 10:54 am - +263 78 896 9497: Thank you mam
12/12/23, 11:00 am - Harmehak: I can see your parents are leading a great family with dedicated children.
12/12/23, 11:00 am - Harmehak: Well Nonkosi now as we proceed ahead, I would like to your thoughts on higher education abroad!

Do you believe it's a life changing decision?
12/12/23, 11:11 am - +263 78 896 9497: I will take that as a compliment
12/12/23, 11:17 am - +263 78 896 9497: I think studying abroad has many opportunities and advantages one of the biggest advantages of studying abroad is the chance to experience another culture that's entirely different from my own. This enriching experience will help me to see things in a different perspective. I will get to try new food, visit new places, listen to traditional music and lots more and honestly that’s hilarious 
And yes I believe it’s a life changing , I think it helps me experience international methods of instructing and deal with a cosmopolitan crowd. This in turn also helps to increase my acumen on the subject and life, in general. <This message was edited>
12/12/23, 11:34 am - Harmehak: Very well expressed, Nonkosi.

So would you also add that you are mentally prepared for a life abroad too?
12/12/23, 11:35 am - +263 78 896 9497: Yes I am prepared mentally for the life abroad
12/12/23, 11:50 am - Harmehak: Nonkosi, I am delighted to see your dedication and I believe you would agree with me that commitment from your parents is equally important!

So now could you please share, if your family members are aware of your plans to study abroad and if they are willing to support your higher education abroad mentally and financially?
12/12/23, 12:00 pm - +263 78 896 9497: Yes they are aware of my plans to study abroad and they are willing to support me each and every step of my  higher life education abroad including mentally and financially
12/12/23, 12:05 pm - Harmehak: I am glad they are supportive.
12/12/23, 12:05 pm - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!
12/12/23, 12:07 pm - +263 78 896 9497: Yes I am super confident and I will keep on updating you as I am still waiting for my A level result
12/12/23, 12:16 pm - Harmehak: Sure please
12/12/23, 12:17 pm - Harmehak: Okay, can you share your O Level results with me for evaluation along with what motivates you to study Software Engineering?
12/12/23, 12:18 pm - +263 78 896 9497: Okay mam
12/12/23, 12:28 pm - Harmehak: Yes please?
12/12/23, 12:31 pm - +263 78 896 9497: Sorry for the delay am still looking for the documents
12/12/23, 12:36 pm - Harmehak: You can type the results for now, Nonkosi.
12/12/23, 12:42 pm - +263 78 896 9497: <Media omitted>
12/12/23, 12:42 pm - Harmehak: Duly received please,

Yes, it's clear.
12/12/23, 12:49 pm - +263 78 896 9497: Thank you
12/12/23, 12:59 pm - Harmehak: I await the response to the remaining part, Nonkosi.
12/12/23, 1:05 pm - +263 78 896 9497: Let me just say that I  enjoy puzzles, logic problems, and finding creative solutions to complex challenges therefore I figured it out that software engineering maybe my right career path. And I enjoy resolving complex issues in Software systems.
12/12/23, 1:18 pm - Harmehak: That's great, Nonkosi 

So did you ever happen to research about the requirements for engineering?
12/12/23, 1:19 pm - +263 78 896 9497: Yes I have already searched
12/12/23, 1:22 pm - +263 78 896 9497: It requires a pass in Mathematics and Computer Science
12/12/23, 1:30 pm - Harmehak: Well, if you would have researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*. whereas if they want to study any Engineering Course then they should have *Physics and Maths* in their A level mandatorily.
12/12/23, 1:30 pm - Harmehak: Physics is a mandatory requirement to pursue Engineering even in Zimbabwe please.
12/12/23, 1:33 pm - +263 78 896 9497: I guess I didn’t do my research pretty well then sorry for that
12/12/23, 1:33 pm - Harmehak: I do understand please
12/12/23, 1:34 pm - Harmehak: Now considering your interests and subject combination, you are eligible to pursue the following:

*Bachelor of science in Computer science*
*Bachelor in computer application*
12/12/23, 1:35 pm - +263 78 896 9497: So when you want to study computer engineering physics is required too?
12/12/23, 1:39 pm - Harmehak: Yes please, Nonkosi.

However you can pursue either of these courses as they cater for same interests.
12/12/23, 1:40 pm - +263 78 896 9497: Thank you so much for guiding me and since I love and enjoy logic problems I think Bachelor of Science in computer science will do
12/12/23, 1:49 pm - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the same.
12/12/23, 1:50 pm - Harmehak: *B.Sc. Computer Science* is a 3 year undergraduate program which deals with subjects and topics related to computer application and services.Technological implementation of computer systems is the main agenda of the program.The program ranges widely from creating quality professionals and research fellows who are working in every sector of the world today.

12/12/23, 1:59 pm - Harmehak: You're welcome Nonkosi
12/12/23, 1:59 pm - Harmehak: Alright Nonkosi, since you have understood the course, can you please tell me, if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself in 5 years and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
12/12/23, 2:07 pm - +263 78 896 9497: I can  see myself in this post five years from now, but I know with this career it will help me to develop my skills, so I expect my capabilities to have been more advanced substantially. I hope to be able to tackle much more challenging projects.and I think I can find more on how to program and develop or add some of my thoughts and skills on how to deal with any computer problems
12/12/23, 2:08 pm - +263 78 896 9497: And definitely that can enable me to archive my dreams of having skills and more knowledge in computers and solving logic problems
12/12/23, 2:09 pm - Harmehak: That is really great Nonkosi, I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations!

Now, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
12/12/23, 2:19 pm - +263 78 896 9497: The question I have been waiting for
So mam the reason I want to study abroad is for independency you know, I want to escape my comfort zone I may describe it as an exciting challenge you know where I have the opportunity to pick up new skills i may not have had whilst  studying at my home country , and besides it all the other reason is that I feel good and I think I would love navigating a new city, communicating in a different language, and budgeting with an unfamiliar currency.Honestly I think that’s hilarious <This message was edited>
12/12/23, 2:26 pm - Harmehak: That is wonderful Nonkosi, well expressed, I can see you are aiming at maximum exposure and willing to put efforts for a great future, Nonkosi.

Now as you know Edoofa Recommends India as a Higher Education destination.

*May I know what is your knowledge or what have you researched about India and Indian Education System which makes you feel that studying in India would help you achieve your dreams?*
12/12/23, 2:42 pm - +263 78 896 9497: Okay so I have seen that there are strong emphasis on science and technology in India. I have seen that India has a long history of higher education meaning it has a very good education background that would definitely help me in archiving my dreams.And it is great and            mesmerizing that Indian Schooling has achieved worldwide acknowledgment with its recognized decent variety of character.Honestly India seems like a pretty great country also in terms of its incredibly diverse with a wide   range of languages ,religions and cultures.And I think I have stated a lot on education last but not least I haven’t forgotten that india is also regarded as A home for great food sorry I had to include that although at first I thought it wasn’t related to the question but I think it is one of the great things about India
12/12/23, 2:51 pm - Harmehak: I am delighted to see that you have thorough awareness and knowledge, Nonkosi.
12/12/23, 2:51 pm - Harmehak: Alright please, let me add to it, you see over the past 6 years, the Edoofa Scholarship Program is only focused in India, because of the following reasons:

12/12/23, 2:52 pm - +263 78 896 9497: I will take that as a compliment thank you mam
12/12/23, 2:55 pm - Harmehak: Yes please!
12/12/23, 2:56 pm - Harmehak: You can go through the shared resources and inform me once done please
12/12/23, 2:59 pm - +263 78 896 9497: Ooh i see mam and I am very pleased that there is gender equality many women are very successful that’s very good
12/12/23, 3:01 pm - +263 78 896 9497: Am very overwhelmed to also learn that Indian has the second largest number of scientists and engineers in the world that’s very good
12/12/23, 3:02 pm - Harmehak: I am glad this intrigued you and you found it helpful, Nonkosi.

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
12/12/23, 3:02 pm - +263 78 896 9497: And I think after today I can proudly say that I know a lot about India
12/12/23, 3:03 pm - +263 78 896 9497: No I do not know about that one but I would be very glad to know
12/12/23, 3:05 pm - Harmehak: Each day offers new learnings and I am glad you could learn more.
12/12/23, 3:06 pm - Harmehak: Sure please, Nonkosi.
12/12/23, 3:06 pm - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
12/12/23, 3:07 pm - +263 78 896 9497: That’s affirmative mam and I am glad to learn and willing to learn more too
12/12/23, 3:08 pm - Harmehak: Wonderful
12/12/23, 3:09 pm - +263 78 896 9497: Wow It looks like one could really survive in India compared to other countries that is what I had noticed
12/12/23, 3:10 pm - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 13 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 5 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
12/12/23, 3:10 pm - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
12/12/23, 3:10 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
12/12/23, 3:10 pm - +263 78 896 9497: That’s incredible and affordable am starting to like the country even more now
12/12/23, 3:11 pm - Harmehak: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well.

However as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2000, simply after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
12/12/23, 3:13 pm - +263 78 896 9497: That’s wonderful thank you for providing me with such information.
12/12/23, 3:15 pm - Harmehak: You're very welcome
12/12/23, 3:15 pm - Harmehak: Nonkosi, Senior Academician Mr Piyush were in Zimbabwe for about 90 days, from his experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,

While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time. 

This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year. 

Wouldn't you agree to the same?
12/12/23, 3:20 pm - +263 78 896 9497: Honestly that’s true mam costs of necessities is increasing day by day and for most our families it is hard to survive with such economies as you have stated that staple meal and curry costs a dollar imagine having to remove a dollar each day Honestly it’s  expensive <This message was edited>
12/12/23, 3:20 pm - Harmehak: Indeed, Nonkosi,

So now are you now in a better position to relate how Edoofa is making higher education affordable and accessible for international students in India, Nonkosi?
12/12/23, 3:22 pm - +263 78 896 9497: Yes mam after this counseling with you I can confidently say that indeed Edoof is making higher education affordable
12/12/23, 3:22 pm - Harmehak: That's great

Now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program and how it would be assisting you further.
12/12/23, 3:22 pm - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
12/12/23, 3:22 pm - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
12/12/23, 3:22 pm - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

12/12/23, 3:22 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
12/12/23, 3:30 pm - +263 78 896 9497: Okay I just went trough the information and I think it is indeed wonderful to be Edoofian with all those opportunities am pretty sure one can definitely archive his or her dream without any doubts
12/12/23, 3:33 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate your words, Nonkosi.
12/12/23, 3:33 pm - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
12/12/23, 3:41 pm - +263 78 896 9497: so basically one can pay for his or her annual fee through earning
12/12/23, 3:41 pm - Harmehak: Surely, Nonkosi.
12/12/23, 3:42 pm - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

12/12/23, 3:43 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
12/12/23, 3:44 pm - +263 78 896 9497: Yeah mam it is a very good program
12/12/23, 3:46 pm - Harmehak: Did you go through the shared video and pictures as well, Nonkosi?
12/12/23, 3:47 pm - +263 78 896 9497: I haven’t I just read the document the video is still loading sorry I have poor network
12/12/23, 3:48 pm - +263 78 896 9497: It had just finished loading let me go through it
12/12/23, 3:50 pm - +263 78 896 9497: I just went through the video so it is possible for one to pay for his or her fees for the whole 3years wow that’s incredible honestly
12/12/23, 3:53 pm - Harmehak: I am glad you are thoroughly following, and yes like you just heard a testimonial.
12/12/23, 3:53 pm - Harmehak: That is great, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes. 

Are you ready?
12/12/23, 3:54 pm - +263 78 896 9497: Yes am ready
12/12/23, 3:55 pm - Harmehak: Nonkosi, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
12/12/23, 3:55 pm - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
12/12/23, 3:58 pm - +263 78 896 9497: If it’s 300 for five university that would be  1500 and if it’s 450 for five university it will be 2250
12/12/23, 4:00 pm - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
12/12/23, 4:00 pm - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
12/12/23, 4:00 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
12/12/23, 4:01 pm - Harmehak: You see Nonkosi, Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
12/12/23, 4:03 pm - +263 78 896 9497: Yes that is true I mean one has to pay for about 350 only and that’s so incredible compared to applying to  almost 5 universities
12/12/23, 4:04 pm - Harmehak: That's amazing, so now that you have understood how Edoofa makes the application process affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
12/12/23, 4:04 pm - Harmehak: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

Phase 3: Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.
12/12/23, 4:04 pm - Harmehak: *However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
12/12/23, 4:07 pm - +263 78 896 9497: Wow the Edoof program is also considerate tooo that’s amazing
12/12/23, 4:07 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate, Nonkosi.
12/12/23, 4:07 pm - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
12/12/23, 4:07 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
12/12/23, 4:07 pm - +263 78 896 9497: Okay I think I understood really well there
12/12/23, 4:08 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in their country itself.
12/12/23, 4:08 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
12/12/23, 4:09 pm - +263 78 896 9497: Yes it is well understood
12/12/23, 4:10 pm - Harmehak: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
12/12/23, 4:10 pm - Harmehak: Basically, this registration fee ($500-$1000) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024-2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
12/12/23, 4:10 pm - Harmehak: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*

Here is a picture of the Visa of one of the Edoofian who arrived in India, for 2023 Academic Intake.

12/12/23, 4:11 pm - +263 78 896 9497: Okay well understood mam
12/12/23, 4:12 pm - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
12/12/23, 4:12 pm - Harmehak: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)
12/12/23, 4:12 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>

12/12/23, 4:20 pm - +263 78 896 9497: On what I had gained from Mrs Magwaza thank again mam
12/12/23, 4:24 pm - Harmehak: Surely please, Nonkosi.

Do connect your parents with Mrs Ruth as well.
12/12/23, 4:24 pm - +263 78 896 9497: Okay mam
12/12/23, 4:32 pm - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
12/12/23, 4:32 pm - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
12/12/23, 4:32 pm - Harmehak: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

16/12/23, 1:14 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Can you please elaborate your questions?

18/12/23, 11:40 am - +263 78 896 9497: Am doing good
18/12/23, 12:15 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
18/12/23, 12:15 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
18/12/23, 12:15 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.
18/12/23, 12:15 pm - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>
18/12/23, 12:15 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Ideally as you know, the tentative dates:
1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 23rd   or 24th December 2023 for $200 and the 23rd   or 24th of January  for the remaining $150.
2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 23rd   or 24th December 2023. Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?
18/12/23, 12:30 pm - +263 78 896 9497: 1
18/12/23, 12:31 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Can parents answers using voice notes ?

18/12/23, 12:39 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Did you discuss of early application benefits with your counselor ?
18/12/23, 12:42 pm - +263 71 256 0675: This message was deleted
18/12/23, 12:43 pm - +263 71 256 0675: <Media omitted>
18/12/23, 12:53 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Please did you go through ? as Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents accounts immediately .
18/12/23, 1:06 pm - +263 71 256 0675: But how possible in this world this can happen ,refunding ?
18/12/23, 1:10 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Please we are a government registered organization and our processes are transparent this refund policy will also be mentioned in your official acceptance letter.
18/12/23, 1:11 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Due to these transparent policies we are appreciated by government bodies as well.
18/12/23, 1:11 pm - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>
18/12/23, 1:33 pm - +263 71 256 0675: Okay i do understand ,let us put our ideas together as a family .we will then come back to you where we need clarifications ,thank you.
18/12/23, 2:10 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Do you want to guide you about the early benefits in depth ?
18/12/23, 2:12 pm - +263 78 896 9497: Yes Sir
18/12/23, 2:39 pm - Sahil Edoofa: When will you get your A level results ?
18/12/23, 3:06 pm - +263 71 256 0675: Early January there about
18/12/23, 5:11 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Please note that the intake for 2024 is already open and Form 6 students are reserving their seats for the same if qualified for the Edoofa Scholarship Program. The major reason for opening the Seat Reservation opportunity for Zimbabwean students is that they receive the results very late compared to other African Nations. The WAEC results of Ghana, Nigeria and other Western African Nations were declared on *7th August this year*, Malawians received their MSCE results in September, Zambians receive the results this year itself when compared to Zimsec A level results(January-February 2024), and they are declared much earlier and the students from other nations will be occupying the majority of the scholarship seats. This is the reason, we evaluate the O level and term results, interests and passion, career goals, extracurriculars, achievements, roles of responsibilities etc to evaluate the form 6 students for the Edoofa scholarship program. We also give the opportunity to parents to take part in the sessions on behalf of applicants so that deserving applicants do not miss the golden opportunity. *So we already have 700+ Zimbabwean students who have qualified for the next intake.*
18/12/23, 5:12 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Also,  do you feel a few months after the results will be sufficient for you to plan and prepare for this huge decision of your child's higher education abroad considering the economic crisis and hyperinflation in Zimbabwe?
18/12/23, 9:48 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I was expecting your response, but it seems you are occupied at the moment, so I will have to schedule your session tomorrow at 11:00 AM CAT as my working hours are over for the day.

Stay Blessed!
