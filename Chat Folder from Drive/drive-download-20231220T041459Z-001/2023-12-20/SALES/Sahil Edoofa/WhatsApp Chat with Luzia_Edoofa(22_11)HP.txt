22/11/23, 12:16 pm - Harmehak: So Mr Casey, as we proceed ahead,

I would like to know Luzia better as a student, how she is at school, her interests and hobbies?

What exactly would she like to pursue for her higher education in India?
22/11/23, 12:30 pm - +260 96 7268026: In terms of discipline,luzia is a well disciplined,focused and humble girl she got motivation from the sister and brother that completed higher education from abroad and now in employment.
Her interest is equally to aim higher in education and get her a job that will make her not struggle in life.
Her hobbies are swimming, reading, writing, playing games like basketball and hokey so as love for children 
First choice is medicine with speciality in paediatrics and second choice to be a pharmacist.
22/11/23, 12:45 pm - Harmehak: Duly received please, Its a pleasure to know about her Mr Casey!

It's intriguing to know of her interests and her hobbies.
22/11/23, 12:46 pm - Harmehak: May I know of her subjects in Grade 12 please?
22/11/23, 12:52 pm - +260 96 7268026: She studied English, Biology, Science (Physics & Chemistry), Mathematics, Civic education, Accounts, Commerce & Religious Education.
22/11/23, 1:15 pm - Harmehak: Duly noted please.
22/11/23, 1:26 pm - Harmehak: You see, it is very unfortunate that we don't offer medicine as a course because of the following reasons:

*1. Affordability:* Medicine is one of the most expensive course everywhere in the world, as it requires high-class facilities and great doctors and mentors to teach that.

*2. Eligibility:* As you would have seen from the video, that India is a great place to study for higher education as it has both qualities of education and affordability, but for medicine in India, you need to give an entrance exam named NEEt, which is very competitive and only 1000 students are selected from millions each year .

*3. Length of the program:* Medicine is 6-8years course including the internships that are mandatory, so it also contributes to the affordability issue.
22/11/23, 1:27 pm - Harmehak: But I realize that she wants to do a course that makes you, the parent proud and also align with her passion. So she can go ahead with the courses like:

*1. Bachelor of Science in Cardiovascular Technology*
*2. Bachelors in  Pharmacy*
*3. Bachelors in Physiotherapy*
*4. Bachelors in Optometry*
*5. Bachelors of Science in Medical Lab Technology* 

These courses have lesser duration than Medicine and are more affordable for students.
22/11/23, 1:35 pm - +260 96 7268026: Noted.. She has no problem with Bachelor in Pharmacy or Physiotherapy.
22/11/23, 1:47 pm - Harmehak: That's wonderful,

Which one shall I brief you about first?
22/11/23, 2:01 pm - +260 96 7268026: Physiotherapy
22/11/23, 2:01 pm - +260 96 7268026: Bachelor in Physiotherapy
22/11/23, 2:05 pm - Harmehak: *Physiotherapy* is a branch of healthcare that applies modes of physical movement such as exercise, massage, besides education, advice, and counselling services to circumstances where movement and function are threatened by ageing, pain, injury, diseases, disorders, conditions, or other environmental factors.

22/11/23, 2:16 pm - +260 96 7268026: Well understood
22/11/23, 2:18 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

22/11/23, 2:40 pm - Harmehak: Did you happen to discuss regarding Pharmacy and Physiotherapy with her please?

22/11/23, 3:29 pm - Harmehak: That's completely alright please.

She can choose whichever she wishes to pursue.
22/11/23, 3:29 pm - Harmehak: Mr Casey, Now as we proceed ahead, I am sure you might have a question in mind, what exactly are the reasons due to which Edoofa Recommends India as a higher education platform?
22/11/23, 3:52 pm - +260 96 7268026: It is about the quality that comes of India's education standards. Besides that the Pharmacological industry is mostly dominated by India.Therefore , with my daughter's qualification from India she can mentor others in Pharmacy, a fast growing profession.
22/11/23, 3:59 pm - Harmehak: That's very correct, Mr Casey!
22/11/23, 3:59 pm - Harmehak: Alright please, let me add to it, you see over the past 6 years, the Edoofa Scholarship Program is only focused in India, because of the following reasons:

22/11/23, 4:39 pm - Harmehak: Have you been able to follow, Mr Casey?
22/11/23, 4:40 pm - +260 96 7268026: Following...
22/11/23, 4:40 pm - Harmehak: I am glad you did, Mr Casey.

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
22/11/23, 5:29 pm - +260 96 7268026: Am not familiar, I can be enlightened on the cost with or without scholarship.
22/11/23, 5:32 pm - Harmehak: Sure please.
22/11/23, 5:32 pm - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
22/11/23, 5:32 pm - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 13 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 5 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
22/11/23, 5:32 pm - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
22/11/23, 5:32 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
22/11/23, 5:49 pm - +260 96 7268026: Following...
22/11/23, 5:50 pm - Harmehak: In simple words Mr Casey, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $2000-3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, 

Now *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

What are you thoughts on the same please?
22/11/23, 5:55 pm - +260 96 7268026: Sounds reasonable
22/11/23, 5:55 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

Now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program in detail and how it would assist you.
22/11/23, 5:55 pm - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
22/11/23, 5:55 pm - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
22/11/23, 5:55 pm - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

22/11/23, 5:55 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
22/11/23, 8:10 pm - Harmehak: I was hoping we could continue, however I would be scheduling your session for *Tomorrow at 9 AM CAT*, as my working hours are over and it's already been a long day, If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
22/11/23, 10:30 pm - +260 96 7268026: Will definitely be available for tomorrow at 9 AM.
23/11/23, 9:05 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
23/11/23, 9:17 am - +260 96 7268026: We may start
23/11/23, 9:21 am - Harmehak: Mr Casey, have you been able to follow the discussion so far please?
23/11/23, 9:21 am - +260 96 7268026: Yes I have
23/11/23, 9:22 am - Harmehak: That's great
23/11/23, 9:22 am - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
23/11/23, 9:24 am - +260 96 7268026: That's how much u pay per month scholarship
23/11/23, 9:34 am - Harmehak: That's how the Earn While You Learn Program works please.

It's just to explain you with the help of an example.
23/11/23, 9:35 am - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

23/11/23, 9:49 am - +260 96 7268026: Following.
23/11/23, 9:50 am - Harmehak: That is great, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 10-15 minutes only. 

Are you ready?
23/11/23, 9:51 am - +260 96 7268026: Yes
23/11/23, 9:52 am - Harmehak: Mr Casey, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
23/11/23, 9:52 am - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
23/11/23, 9:55 am - +260 96 7268026: Of course more.
23/11/23, 9:56 am - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
23/11/23, 9:56 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
23/11/23, 9:56 am - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
23/11/23, 9:56 am - Harmehak: You see Mr Casey, Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
23/11/23, 9:59 am - +260 96 7268026: Correct!
23/11/23, 10:04 am - Harmehak: That's amazing, so now that you have understood how Edoofa makes the application process affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
23/11/23, 10:04 am - Harmehak: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

Phase 3: Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.
23/11/23, 10:04 am - Harmehak: *However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
23/11/23, 10:13 am - +260 96 7268026: You have the heart for Africa... Continue!
23/11/23, 10:15 am - Harmehak: I appreciate please.
23/11/23, 10:15 am - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
23/11/23, 10:16 am - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in their country itself.
23/11/23, 10:16 am - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
23/11/23, 10:18 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
23/11/23, 10:23 am - +260 96 7268026: Yes I do.
23/11/23, 10:26 am - Harmehak: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
23/11/23, 10:26 am - Harmehak: Basically, this registration fee ($500-$1000) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024-2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
23/11/23, 10:26 am - Harmehak: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*

Here is a picture of the Visa of one of the Edoofian who arrived in India, for 2023 Academic Intake.

23/11/23, 11:24 am - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
23/11/23, 11:24 am - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
23/11/23, 11:24 am - Harmehak: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

As the results have been officially conveyed by the Academic Board via email, it is essential to acknowledge them. Furthermore, for your convenience, we have attached the Acceptance Letter from the Board to this group.

You are supposed to acknowledge the result via Email , and go through your Acceptance Letter properly. Did you do the same?

11/12/23, 10:43 pm - +260 96 2424401: We are happy and appreciate our daughter's acceptance letter (Luzia).However,as earlier noted in our introductory counselling session,we indicated that our source of income is from monthly rentals and a teachers salary which comes at the end of the month too.
So whatever we collected at the end of November has already  been utilised as per budget.
Therefore,we are kindly asking if you can allow us pay the mentioned amount of 200 USD on 30th December,2023 then the 150 USD be paid as you indicated,13 th January,2024.
We would also like to make you aware that our income from whtever source normally comes at the end of each month.
Waiting to hearing from you soon and consideration of our humble request.
12/12/23, 11:56 am - Sahil Edoofa: Good morning
How are you doing today?
12/12/23, 11:58 am - +260 96 2424401: Morning.
We are fine thank you and you?
12/12/23, 12:43 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Please did you manage to go through the acceptance letter and understand the deadlines offered by the academic board to reserve your seat ?
13/12/23, 12:26 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Good afternoon
How are you doing today?
13/12/23, 12:33 pm - +260 96 2424401: Fine thank you and you?
13/12/23, 12:57 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I am fine thank you
13/12/23, 12:59 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Please can you share when is your deadline date ?
13/12/23, 12:59 pm - Sahil Edoofa: To pay first part of enrollment fees in order to reserve your seat .
13/12/23, 1:03 pm - +260 96 2424401: 30th December,2023.
13/12/23, 1:04 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Please deadline to reserve the seat is 18 December
13/12/23, 1:05 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I wanted to have a word regarding the formality completion of Luzia, since you shared with me that because of recent completion of Luzia's fee formalities it is a bit challenging for you to complete the enrollment formalities within the stipulated timeline. I did happen to discuss the same with the Academic Board and I did get an appropriate solution for the same. so are we good to have a word regarding the same please?
13/12/23, 1:06 pm - +260 96 2424401: Yes please.
13/12/23, 1:50 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I did discuss about Luzia's application and your challenges with the Academic Board, but you see as per the acting policies and standards the Academic Board is not viable to change the 7 day deadline period. However, the Academic Board has mentioned that they are willing to consider Luzia's Application, if the family faces a challenge in completing the required $200 within the stipulated timeline. As a remedial you can complete a part fee of $100 within the first 7 days, then $100 by next 21 days and finally the remaining $150 would be completed in next 30 days. All in all for $350 you will have time of 58 days.

Looking at the current situation, I feel this would be convenient to you and your family, isn't it
