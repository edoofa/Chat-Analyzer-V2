1. Your understanding of the Edoofa program?

07/12/23, 9:13 am - +263 78 038 1173: Edoofa program offers  50 to 100 percent scholarships. Edoofa is not like a charity and it is rare to find a 100 percent scholarship. Edoofa may help students to have access to higher education since nowadays tertiary education is more dearer
07/12/23, 9:16 am - Harmehak: Alright please,

What else did you learn?
07/12/23, 9:21 am - +263 78 038 1173: Edoofa offers scholarships for all countries in the world especially for African nations. Edoofa will help students to achieve their goals and start new life abroad
07/12/23, 9:21 am - +263 78 038 1173: Edoofa also have access to many institutions such as colleges, universities and schools in India. The expenses for international students were very high but due to the contribution of the Edoofa it is now affordable
07/12/23, 9:28 am - +263 78 038 1173: Tuition fees can be reduced by doing tasks and projects. A student cannot work and earn. The living expenses after scholarships is 2000-3000 per annum. Edoofa does not offer scholarships to students considering that they are poor or their family backgrounds but they offer scholarships to well behaved students who always participate marvellously
07/12/23, 9:31 am - +263 78 038 1173: Edoofa also helps students to apply for their visas through the embassy and the Indian ministry of home affairs. A student should have to pay for the visa at the Indian embassy.
07/12/23, 9:47 am - Harmehak: I am glad you thoroughly followed the document, Munyaradzi.

So did you happen to discuss everything with your parents?
07/12/23, 9:47 am - +263 78 038 1173: Yes I have read everything for them
07/12/23, 9:53 am - Harmehak: That's wonderful,

So I believe you understand the following too?
07/12/23, 9:53 am - Harmehak: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $2000-3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, 

Now *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
07/12/23, 10:12 am - +263 78 038 1173: Yes I have understood
07/12/23, 10:21 am - Harmehak: That's good,

So are they willing to support you financially, Munyaradzi?

07/12/23, 11:33 am - Harmehak: Duly noted please
07/12/23, 11:34 am - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!
07/12/23, 11:50 am - +263 78 038 1173: I'm confident
07/12/23, 12:15 pm - Harmehak: That's wonderful

07/12/23, 12:40 pm - +263 78 038 1173: When I was young I used to construct homemade bridges and electric trains so I have discovered that I should carry on with my task
07/12/23, 12:41 pm - Harmehak: Well that's great,

However did you happen to research about the requirements for Engineering, Munyaradzi?
07/12/23, 12:42 pm - +263 78 038 1173: I was fully motivated to be an engineer when I had stories of collapsed bridges which destroyed many peoples lives
07/12/23, 12:43 pm - +263 78 038 1173: Yes there is need for A level physics but unfortunately I didn't have a chance to scoop that combination at A level
07/12/23, 12:45 pm - Harmehak: Very correct.
07/12/23, 12:45 pm - Harmehak: I can see in your student file that you opted for Business Administration,

07/12/23, 2:45 pm - +263 78 038 1173: I'm now having a zeal to study abroad Ms Harmehak
07/12/23, 3:10 pm - Harmehak: I am glad this intrigued you and you found it helpful, Munyaradzi 

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
07/12/23, 4:32 pm - Harmehak: Are we connected please?
07/12/23, 6:01 pm - Harmehak: I was expecting your response, however it seems you are occupied, I would be scheduling your session for *Tomorrow at 9 AM CAT*, as my working hours for the day are over, If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
07/12/23, 7:27 pm - +263 78 038 1173: Yes we are now connected I was facing network problem
07/12/23, 7:28 pm - +263 78 038 1173: Yes they are familiar with the cost
08/12/23, 9:01 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
08/12/23, 9:02 am - +263 78 038 1173: Morning how are Ms Harmehak
08/12/23, 9:11 am - Harmehak: Alright please
08/12/23, 9:11 am - Harmehak: Let me add about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
08/12/23, 9:11 am - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 13 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 5 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
08/12/23, 9:11 am - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
08/12/23, 9:11 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
08/12/23, 9:16 am - +263 78 038 1173: Ohhhh this is great news India is offering higher education at affordable cost
08/12/23, 9:18 am - Harmehak: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well.

However as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2000, simply after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
08/12/23, 9:18 am - Harmehak: Indeed please
08/12/23, 9:19 am - +263 78 038 1173: Ok this is great I will work hard to achieve my dreams
08/12/23, 9:27 am - Harmehak: I am glad, Munyaradzi.
08/12/23, 9:28 am - Harmehak: Munyaradzi, Senior Academician Mr Piyush were in Zimbabwe for about 90 days, from his experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,

While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time. 

This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year. 

Wouldn't you agree to the same?
08/12/23, 9:29 am - +263 78 038 1173: Yes I agree
08/12/23, 9:36 am - Harmehak: So now are you in a better position to relate how Edoofa is making higher education affordable and accessible for international students, Munyaradzi?
08/12/23, 9:37 am - +263 78 038 1173: Yes I am now in a better position
08/12/23, 9:39 am - Harmehak: That's great,

Now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program in detail and how it would assist you.
08/12/23, 9:39 am - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
08/12/23, 9:39 am - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
08/12/23, 9:39 am - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

08/12/23, 9:39 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
08/12/23, 9:40 am - +263 78 038 1173: It will reduce my tuition fee through credits
08/12/23, 9:42 am - Harmehak: Yes please, Munyaradzi
08/12/23, 9:42 am - +263 78 038 1173: I get it thanks
08/12/23, 9:42 am - Harmehak: I am glad you are thoroughly following!
08/12/23, 9:43 am - +263 78 038 1173: Me too I am glad to have this program
08/12/23, 9:46 am - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $1800 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$600 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $50-$60 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
08/12/23, 9:52 am - +263 78 038 1173: I'm glad to hear that I can earn while I learn to sponsor my higher education
08/12/23, 9:56 am - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

08/12/23, 10:15 am - +263 78 038 1173: This is a good program I am interested Ms Harmehak. Earn while you learn program may fund my high education to a greater extent
08/12/23, 10:17 am - Harmehak: That is great, Munyaradzi.

So now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes. 

Are you ready?
08/12/23, 10:19 am - +263 78 038 1173: Yes I am ready
08/12/23, 10:20 am - Harmehak: Munyaradzi, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
08/12/23, 10:21 am - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
08/12/23, 10:36 am - +263 78 038 1173: Almost 1500-2500
08/12/23, 10:37 am - +263 78 038 1173: Ok ok it's fine then
08/12/23, 10:38 am - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
08/12/23, 10:39 am - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
08/12/23, 10:39 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
08/12/23, 10:39 am - Harmehak: You see, Munyaradzi, Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
08/12/23, 10:42 am - +263 78 038 1173: Edoofa program is making the process cheap
08/12/23, 10:43 am - +263 78 038 1173: Yes I think so
08/12/23, 10:46 am - Harmehak: That's amazing, so now that you have understood how Edoofa makes the application process affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
08/12/23, 10:47 am - Harmehak: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

Phase 3: Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.
08/12/23, 10:47 am - Harmehak: *However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
08/12/23, 10:57 am - +263 78 038 1173: Good news
08/12/23, 10:57 am - +263 78 038 1173: Great news
08/12/23, 10:59 am - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
08/12/23, 10:59 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
08/12/23, 10:59 am - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in their country itself.
08/12/23, 10:59 am - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
08/12/23, 11:03 am - +263 78 038 1173: Ok I get it
08/12/23, 11:04 am - Harmehak: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
08/12/23, 11:04 am - Harmehak: Basically, this registration fee ($500-$1000) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024-2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
08/12/23, 11:04 am - Harmehak: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*

Here is a picture of the Visa of one of the Edoofian who arrived in India, for 2023 Academic Intake.

08/12/23, 11:09 am - +263 78 038 1173: Ok I get it it's good
08/12/23, 11:10 am - +263 78 038 1173: Ohhhh great news
08/12/23, 11:11 am - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
08/12/23, 11:11 am - Harmehak: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)

08/12/23, 11:20 am - Harmehak: Do connect her with your parents too.
08/12/23, 11:21 am - +263 78 038 1173: Ok I will do so
08/12/23, 11:21 am - Harmehak: Thats great, 

So far, do you have any any queries?
08/12/23, 11:25 am - +263 78 038 1173: No I don't have any one
08/12/23, 11:29 am - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
08/12/23, 11:29 am - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
08/12/23, 11:29 am - Harmehak: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

Mrs. Ruth's experience with Edoofa is a testament to the transformative impact our programs can have. She not only managed her family's needs but also seized the opportunity for her daughters to achieve higher education.

*Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage.*
A fact that draws our attention is that, according to his position in life, an extravagant man is either admired or loathed. A successful business man does nothing to increase his popularity by being prudent with his money. A person who is wealthy is expected to lead a luxurious life and to be lavish with his hospitality. If he is not so, he is considered mean, and his reputation in business may even suffer in consequence. The paradox remains that he had not been careful with his money in the first place; he would never have achieved his present wealth.
Among the low income group, a different set of values exists. The young clerk, who makes his wife a present of a new dress when he has not paid his house rent, is condemned as extravagant. Carefulness with money to the point of meanness is applauded as a virtue. Nothing in his life is considered more worthy than paying his bills. The ideal wife for such a man separates her housekeeping money into joyless little piles – so much for rent, for food, for the children’s shoes, she is able to face the milkman with equanimity every, month satisfied with her economizing ways , and never knows the guilt of buying something she can’t really afford .
As for myself, I fall neither of these categories. If I have money to spare I can be extravagant, but when, as is usually the case, I am hard up and then I am the meanest man imaginable.

1. Which of the following would be the most appropriate title for the passage
a)The cause of poverty is extravagance.
b)Stingy habits of the poor.
c)Being extravagant is always condemnable.
d)Extravagance is a part of the rich as well as of the poor.

2.According to the passage the person, who is a successful businessman and wealthy
a)Is more popular if he appears to be wasting away his time.
b)Is expected to have lavish lifestyle.
c)Must be extravagant before achieving success.
d)Should not bother about popularity.

3. The phrase ‘lavish with his hospitality’ in the third sentence of the first paragraph means
a)Extravagance in entertaining guest.
b)Unconcerned in treating his friends and relatives.
c)Thoughtful in spending only on guests and strangers.
d)Stinginess in dealing with his relatives.

4.The word ‘paradox’ in the last sentence of the first paragraph means
a)A word that brings out the hidden meaning
b)Statement based on facts
c)a statement that seems self-contradictory but in reality expresses a possible truth.
d)Statement based on the popular opinion

5.What is the meaning of the word “equanimity”?
a)Calmness
b)Discomposure
c)Equivocal
d)Dubious

Whey to Go Greek yogurt—a strained form of cultured yogurt—has grown enormously in popularity in the United States since it was first introduced in the country in the late 1980s. From 2011 to 2012 alone, sales of Greek yogurt in the US increased by 50 percent. The resulting increase in Greek yogurt production has forced those involved in the business to address the detrimental effects that the yogurt-making process may be having on the environment. Fortunately, farmers and others in the Greek yogurt business have found many methods of controlling and eliminating most environmental threats. Given these solutions as well as the many health benefits of the food, the advantages of Greek yogurt Q5. outdo the potential drawbacks of its production.Sentence [1] The main environmental problem caused by the production of Greek yogurt is the creation of acid whey as a by-product.Sentence [2] Because it requires up to four times more milk to make than conventional yogurt does, Greek yogurt produces larger amounts of acid whey, which is difficult to dispose of.Sentence [3] To address the problem of disposal, farmers have found a number of uses for acid whey. Sentence[4] They can add it to livestock feed as a protein Q.6. supplement, and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt.Sentence[5] If it is improperly introduced into the environment, acid-whey runoff Q.7. can pollute waterways, depleting the oxygen content of streams and rivers as it decomposes. Sentence [6] Yogurt manufacturers, food Q.8. scientists; and government officials are also working together to develop additional solutions for reusing whey.

It is true that many Africans have poor diets because their farms are stagnant and inefficient to a greater extent. 
The writer seeks to evaluate that mamny Africans have poor diets because their farms are stagnant and inefficient. 

Firstly, the writer insist that the majority if not the minority of African countries use outdated machinery. A typical example that may fully explain the use of outdated machinery is the use of ox-drawn ploughs in a country like Zimbabwe. The use of these ox-drawn ploughs has resulted in productive and allocative inefficiency. On the same note the writer insist that most  African people fail to enjoy a balanced diet due to the issue of poverty 

In addition to that, most African countries are affected by the problem of inflation. Inflation refers to a persistent increase in the price of general goods and services. This may lead to low purchasing power of the country's currency leading to high cost of purchasing inputs for agricultural purposes 

Furthermore, most African countries are affected by political instability. This is a major cause of wastage of resources in the sense that people will invest in arms and ammunition instead of investing in Agriculture which may be the source of the balanced diet. 

However, the writer may argue that some African countries may be able to afford good diets through the implementation of national agricultural projects such as command agriculture in Zimbabwe were farmers are given inputs and machinery to cultivate their farms

In conclusion, the writer argues that the majority of the African countries have poor diets because their farms are stagnant and inefficient.

11/12/23, 9:31 am - Harmehak: Hello Mrs Tarisai!

I am delighted to know that please.

So far, do you have any queries?
11/12/23, 9:40 am - +263 78 346 3459: Can you explain for on the issue of tuition fee
11/12/23, 9:41 am - Harmehak: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well.
11/12/23, 9:41 am - Harmehak: However as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2000, simply after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
11/12/23, 9:43 am - +263 78 346 3459: Ok thank you I have understand
11/12/23, 9:43 am - Harmehak: Mrs Tarisai, see you willing to support Munyaradzi for the same?

If so, can you please acknowledge using a voice note?
11/12/23, 9:55 am - +263 78 346 3459: <Media omitted>
11/12/23, 10:10 am - Harmehak: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
11/12/23, 10:10 am - Harmehak: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
11/12/23, 10:10 am - Harmehak: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.
11/12/23, 10:10 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
11/12/23, 10:12 am - Harmehak: Ideally as you know, the tentative dates:

1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 17th  or 18th December 2023 for $200 and the  17th  or 18th of January for the remaining $150.
2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 17th  or 18th December 2023. 

Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?
11/12/23, 10:31 am - +263 78 038 1173: I will try to work hard to fund my son
11/12/23, 10:33 am - Harmehak: Mrs Tarisai, can you please acknowledge using a voice note?

Which option would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?
11/12/23, 10:34 am - +263 78 346 3459: I'm glad to hear this good news about the Edoofa scholarship program
11/12/23, 10:35 am - Harmehak: I appreciate
11/12/23, 10:59 am - Harmehak: I await your response, Mrs Tarisai.

13/12/23, 11:00 am - Sahil Edoofa: Greeting to you *Mr. Mailos Musa and Mrs. Tarisai Gibson Musa and Munyaradzi T Musa’s*,

*I am Sahil, the Senior Career Counselor at Edoofa* 

I have been actively involved in evaluating your application since the beginning of your sessions with our dedicated counselor. I must express my admiration for your commitment to supporting your child's higher education, a sentiment echoed not only in your application but also in the positive feedback received from your school authorities.

Having closely followed your journey, I am pleased to inform you that your interview was impressive, and I personally advocated for your selection during discussions with the Academic Board. Your dedication and enthusiasm have played a significant role in securing your eligibility for the scholarship.
13/12/23, 11:01 am - Sahil Edoofa: Heartiest congratulations to you and your family, *Mr. Mailos Musa and Mrs. Tarisai Gibson Musa as Munyaradzi T Musa’s* application was found eligible for the Edoofa Scholarship Program. I have been so happy and excited myself when I saw you passed the eligibility check stage 👏🏽👏🏽.

As the results have been officially conveyed by the Academic Board via email, it is essential to acknowledge them. Furthermore, for your convenience, we have attached the Acceptance Letter from the Board to this group.

You are supposed to acknowledge the result via Email and go through your Acceptance Letter properly. Did you do the same?
13/12/23, 11:01 am - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>
13/12/23, 12:39 pm - +263 78 038 1173: Thank you my counselor
13/12/23, 1:10 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Congratulations! Please take your time to thoroughly review the letter and discuss it with your family. Afterward, we can schedule a discussion to address any questions or concerns you may have.
13/12/23, 1:15 pm - +263 78 346 3459: Thank you sir.the Edoofa program is great since  it may Lower my son tuition fee for higher tertiary Education
13/12/23, 1:42 pm - +263 78 038 1173: I didn't acknowledge my results via Email
13/12/23, 1:44 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Can you please elaborate your concern ?
13/12/23, 1:47 pm - +263 78 038 1173: Where can we pay cash to Mr Jerera
13/12/23, 1:48 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Okay so basically you see in the first mode, the Direct Bank Transfer Mode, the transfer charges which are to be borne by the parents of the student ranges between $100 to $120 which become quite high for a lot of parents considering the economic situation in Zimbabwe itself. So as not every student is in a position to cater for an additional $100 to $120 just as transfer charge, the second mode was introduced, wherein, it is the Bank deposit in Mr. Charles's Account, in this the transfer charges get divided amongst 10 students resulting in an equivalent bearing of 12.5% at the end.

So as you can see in the letter that there is a Bank deposit in, Mr. Charles Jerera (Retired Education Officer)'s account as he is our Associated Partner there in Zimbabwe, Since 2020 there have been over 1400+ students who have been assisted by Mr Charles inorder to complete their enrollment formalities as well as university fee payments after arriving in India.
13/12/23, 1:48 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Therefore the fee can also be paid through him. Since his account is a NOSTRO Account which only holds USD itself, therefore the necessary amount including the transfer charges in this mode itself would be $394 ($350 + $44 transfer charges), and the same details are as below:-

BANK NAME: FBC

SWIFT CODE: FBCPZWHA

ACC NAME: CHARLES JERERA
