But it's now ok
15/12/23, 12:26 pm - Gurvinder: Noted.
15/12/23, 12:26 pm - Gurvinder: Okay, so can you tell me what all did you learn about the Edoofa Program from Ropafadzo, also do tell me whether you learnt about Ropafadzo’s Journey and Experience with the Edoofa Program?
15/12/23, 12:54 pm - +263 77 614 0897: This message was deleted
15/12/23, 12:56 pm - +263 77 614 0897: I was also told Edoofa also helps to shape students preparing them for future jobs in the Economy. In Zimbabwe nowadays  it is very difficult to get a job without connections but by join Edoofa wen I  graduate they will help me to look for a job and you also get better chances of working abroad
15/12/23, 12:58 pm - +263 77 614 0897: Was told  Edoofa is a scholarship programme that offers 50-100% scholarships to students in Africa. The fees is very affordable because Edoofa offers scholarship credits in which you will he given tasks to do and if you complete those tasks you are given scholarship credits that is in the form of money which will be used to pay ur tuition fees.
15/12/23, 1:32 pm - Gurvinder: That is correct, let me also brief you about the program.
15/12/23, 1:32 pm - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
15/12/23, 1:32 pm - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
15/12/23, 1:32 pm - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
15/12/23, 1:32 pm - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
15/12/23, 1:50 pm - +263 77 614 0897: I would wanna be part of the program
15/12/23, 1:50 pm - +263 77 614 0897: I am an individual who really like being independent
So I would like such an opportunity since I would be able to reduce the financial burden
15/12/23, 2:39 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so Precious, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
15/12/23, 2:42 pm - +263 77 614 0897: I think I can meet the two significant metrices
15/12/23, 3:17 pm - Gurvinder: That is great.
15/12/23, 3:17 pm - Gurvinder: Now Precious, I would like to know you better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about yourself, your career aspiration do include sharing about:-

1. Your highest education level?
2. The course you would like to study?
3. What do your parents do?
4. What is your parent’s highest education level?
5. Who has been supporting you for your Education so far?

7. Do you have any siblings? if yes, what do they do?
8. May I know which school do you study at and in which province is it located along with that how much was your per-term fee in A level?

Please elaborate on your answers and answer them in points, so that I can understand your application more briefly and assist you in a better way

We make sure the opportunity is provided to deserving students who are well inclined to their career paths.
