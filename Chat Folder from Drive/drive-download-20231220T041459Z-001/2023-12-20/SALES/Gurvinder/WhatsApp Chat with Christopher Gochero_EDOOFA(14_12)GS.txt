16/12/23, 8:34 pm - Gurvinder: Hi Dear, I hope you are doing well.

I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons that I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship. 

I hope to get a positive response from you soon.
16/12/23, 9:49 pm - +263 71 597 4800: Mr Gurvinder, forgive my absence, the network reliability this side is poor so it's really tough to connect, and I really want to talk about the opportunity ahead of me with you, sir. I have relatives in Madokero who can make this easier so on Tuesday I'm going there and I will make sure that by ten I will start chatting with you, if you're comfortable we can even make a video call because they have wifi over there

18/12/23, 7:30 pm - Gurvinder: Hi Dear, I hope you are doing well

I was waiting for you to share your concerns with me but unfortunately, I didn’t hear from you and therefore I was asked to put your application on hold, but before doing the same, I was going through the form you submitted, I noticed that you come from a family background wherein you plan to pursue your higher education abroad and was looking for a scholarship. I am looking forward to hearing from you so that I can make your dream of higher education abroad come true through an affordable, accessible, and employment-oriented higher education program.

19/12/23, 10:17 am - +263 71 597 4800: Hi Sir, was my application complete or i need to do some things to complete it
19/12/23, 10:19 am - +263 71 597 4800: It was network disturbing me, now i can chat full time
19/12/23, 10:30 am - +263 71 597 4800: Mr Gurvinder, my concerns for tertiary education  I needed to secure a scholarship that can help me achieve to pursue a my career in aerospace engineering or mechanical which i can further narrow down to specialisation
19/12/23, 10:33 am - +263 71 597 4800: Im really concerned with my tuition and how I will be living I'm Willing to work to earn something for my residential expenses and anything i can cover thereof
19/12/23, 10:37 am - +263 71 597 4800: When you say affordable, meaning I have to pay , how much will I have to pay
19/12/23, 11:27 am - +263 71 597 4800: null
19/12/23, 11:58 am - Gurvinder: Please let us be patient and continue with your counselling session.
19/12/23, 11:59 am - Gurvinder: Okay, so can you tell me what all did you learn about the Edoofa Program from Auxillia, also do tell me whether you learnt about Auxillia’s Journey and Experience with the Edoofa Program?
19/12/23, 12:07 pm - +263 71 597 4800: She told me that there was a program that she wanted me to join which was helping her , because  it affordable to study abroad with a scholarship and a side job to earn while you are attending university
19/12/23, 12:10 pm - +263 71 597 4800: I haven't learnt much about her journey, though she said there are some huddles therein in the way which I'm yet to learn
19/12/23, 12:20 pm - +263 71 597 4800: But I have learnt about the steps to become an edoofian
19/12/23, 12:54 pm - Gurvinder: Noted, let me brief you about the program myself.
19/12/23, 12:55 pm - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
19/12/23, 12:55 pm - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
19/12/23, 12:55 pm - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
19/12/23, 12:55 pm - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
19/12/23, 1:01 pm - +263 71 597 4800: It can never be beautifully articulated
19/12/23, 1:07 pm - +263 71 597 4800: I do not wish to reduce the burden but to eliminate it from my mother's mind  and a lot of other people who , from since I graduated high school, have been asking me what I do I really want that seems to be not working at all, some have already begun encouraging that I find a job and start helping my mother and brother to continue his education whilst I'm working and probably get an on the job training which has also proven difficult in that qualified individuals are also looking for those opportunities, so the competition is stiff
19/12/23, 1:11 pm - +263 71 597 4800: So I wanted to sharpen my skills and make myself a competent individual who can be helpful to give back to at least my community, and then my country, probably make it up to the world, just to give back more than I consume , what some call a positive net contribution to the world , in short just to be helpful
19/12/23, 1:23 pm - Gurvinder: Noted.
19/12/23, 1:23 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so Christopher, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
19/12/23, 1:27 pm - +263 71 597 4800: Yes , number 1, I do not know if the other days count though, but my mom cannot be with me
19/12/23, 1:56 pm - Gurvinder: May I know the reason why?
19/12/23, 1:58 pm - +263 71 597 4800: My mom doesn't have a phone that can go on WhatsApp, and she's is in Bulawayo, I'm in Harare , maybe she can because her friend is on WhatsApp and if we ask her to let my mom join on her phone , I do not know if that works for you
19/12/23, 2:00 pm - +263 71 597 4800: And also , like I said I will be at Madokero where my mom's aunt stays , she said I can use her wifi for this counseling session so maybe I can ask her to join too
19/12/23, 2:12 pm - Gurvinder: Yes please, you can ask your aunt to join.
19/12/23, 2:12 pm - Gurvinder: Please add the family members and guardians who will play an important role for your higher education.
19/12/23, 2:13 pm - Gurvinder: And notify them to introduce themselves when they join the group.
19/12/23, 2:13 pm - +263 71 597 4800: Can I get the link of the group
19/12/23, 2:27 pm - +263 71 966 8310 joined using this group's invite link
