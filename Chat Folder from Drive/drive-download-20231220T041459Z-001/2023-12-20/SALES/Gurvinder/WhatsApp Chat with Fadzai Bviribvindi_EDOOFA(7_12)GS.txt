What did you learn about the Edoofa Program after interacting with a student beneficiary of the Edoofa Scholarship?From interacting with a student who benefited from a scholarship program, I learned that scholarships can have a huge impact on a person's life. They can help provide access to education and opportunities that might not otherwise be available, and they can give students the financial support they need to focus on their studies. The student I spoke with was very grateful for the support they received, and said that it made a huge difference in their life. They were able to pursue their dream of getting a college education and are now on track to have a successful career. It was inspiring to hear about their experience and how scholarships can change people's lives.

Why should you be accepted into the Edoofa Program (20-40 Words)?To be a successful candidate for the Edoofa scholarship program, I would emphasize my commitment to helping students succeed. I would highlight my ability to provide personalized support, including identifying and addressing individual learning needs, providing real-time feedback, and suggesting resources to help students master the material. I would also highlight my ability to identify and address gaps in a student's knowledge and skills, and to make recommendations for further study. Finally, I would showcase my ability to adapt and respond to changes in the educational landscape, and to support students as they navigate their educational journey.

*"Education is the passport to the future, for tomorrow belongs to those who prepare for it today."*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
11/12/23, 9:24 am - +263 78 441 2796: Good morning
11/12/23, 9:24 am - +263 78 441 2796: Present ✋🏻
11/12/23, 9:47 am - Gurvinder: Please address this.
11/12/23, 10:00 am - +263 78 441 2796: I have learned that Edoofa Program is a form of financial aid given to students to help them pursue their education.   The purpose of a Edoofa Program is to help students cover the costs of higher education, such as tuition, books, and other expenses.
11/12/23, 10:15 am - Gurvinder: Noted.
11/12/23, 10:15 am - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the program myself.
11/12/23, 10:15 am - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
11/12/23, 10:15 am - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
11/12/23, 10:15 am - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
11/12/23, 10:16 am - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
11/12/23, 11:19 am - +263 78 441 2796: Noted
11/12/23, 12:21 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so Fadzai, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.
11/12/23, 12:21 pm - Gurvinder: Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
11/12/23, 8:02 pm - Gurvinder: Dear, I was expecting your response in the counseling session, but you could not get back to me due to some reason so I am about to finish my second counseling slot for the day, I will have to schedule your session for *Tomorrow at 9 am CAT*. 

Please note that I have two counseling slots in a day which are during my working hours from *7:30 am to 4:30 pm CAT Monday to Friday*, so to complete your application you would have to be present during that time. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning. Therefore I would like you to be online at the above-mentioned time for a smooth conversation.

18/12/23, 9:41 pm - +263 78 441 2796: First off, l was   motivated by the desire to understand what makes organizations successful in today's competitive global business landscape. This includes gaining the knowledge and skills required to navigate and thrive in a saturated market.

Then there's the aspect of leadership development. Business management studies often involve the acquisition of leadership skills, which is all about the ability to motivate and inspire others to contribute towards the success of an organization.

Additionally, business management education can strengthen project management capabilities and provide insights into investment and finance, offering a comprehensive understanding of what drives the global economy.

For some, the appeal lies in the opportunity to develop personal leadership skills, manage and motivate people at work, and apply management principles in real-world scenarios. It's all about personal development and sociability in the workplace.

And of course, there are those who are motivated by a curiosity about what motivates people to buy goods or adopt certain behaviors. This curiosity can lead to a focus on people management, finance, marketplace analysis, and business planning.

These motivations collectively highlight the multifaceted appeal of studying business management, encompassing aspects such as leadership development, communication skills, understanding organizational success, and personal growth.

The above is what motivates me in the field of  business Management some of which l did not mention above.

19/12/23, 1:58 pm - Gurvinder: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.
19/12/23, 1:58 pm - Gurvinder: Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.
