19/12/23, 11:42 am - Gurvinder: It is a pleasure to connect with you today Kulela, and Mrs Changwe,

You can address me as Mr Gurvinder, we do have Mr Shubham, Senior Academician and  Mr Jyotishman, Head of Admissions who will be evaluating your responses for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
19/12/23, 11:43 am - +260 767735131: My pleasure to interact with you too
19/12/23, 12:19 pm - Gurvinder: So should I brief you about the program?
19/12/23, 12:31 pm - +260 767735131: Yes please
19/12/23, 1:06 pm - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
19/12/23, 1:06 pm - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
19/12/23, 1:06 pm - Gurvinder: EDOOFA has commended the new government for its dedicated efforts and positive changes in the education sector, including the elimination of school fees, an increase in the number of teachers, and a focus on protecting vulnerable learners, particularly adolescent girls. *Edoofa is proud to support the government in its mission to transform the education sector and achieve sustainable development, aimed at ensuring quality education that is inclusive and equitable for all by 2030.*
19/12/23, 1:07 pm - Gurvinder: With the influx of students from Zimbabwe, we recorded more than 1500 students to the program in each of the last two years. Having a strong network and grasp of more than 100 schools with a panel of Headmasters, teachers, parents, and other educators, we now look to replicate our success in Zambia as well where we have already begun enrolling students since the last 6 months and we have closed 2023 intake with over 1500 students.
19/12/23, 1:07 pm - Gurvinder: *Our strong relationships with educational institutions, such as Penmal Connect Ltd. and Trident College in Zambia, have led to numerous successful outcomes and partnerships with schools including Kamulanga High, Canisius Secondary, Sanjongo Secondary, The Copperbelt University, Chavuma Boarding Secondary, Mutanda Boarding Secondary, Chimwemwe Secondary, National Hillcrest, Matero Boys Secondary, and others. We are also connected with institutions like Njase, Ndola Girls, Fatima Secondary, Torbit, and Zambezi Boarding among others, to provide, expand and build upon the opportunities of the Edoofa Scholarship Program for deserving students throughout Zambia*

19/12/23, 1:07 pm - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
19/12/23, 1:14 pm - +260 767735131: Yes it would be a good opportunity for me personally because every good work has a procedure and one has to be determined and forcused
19/12/23, 1:28 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so Kulela, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
19/12/23, 1:30 pm - +260 767735131: Yes I do
19/12/23, 1:38 pm - +260 97 6262181: The pleasure is mine  Mr Gurivinder
19/12/23, 2:02 pm - Gurvinder: Now Kulela, I would like to know you better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about yourself, your career aspiration do include sharing about:-

1. Your highest education level?
2. The course you would like to study?
3. What do your parents do?
4. What is your parent’s highest education level?
5. Who has been supporting you for your Education so far?
6. Who will be supporting you financially for your higher education abroad?
7. Do you have any siblings? if yes, what do they do?
8. May I know which school do you study at and in which province is it located along with that how much was your per-term fee in Grade 12?

Please elaborate on your answers and answer them in points, so that I can understand your application more briefly and assist you in a better way
19/12/23, 2:17 pm - +260 767735131: -Am blessings kulela

-I was studying at Njase Girls Secondary School, in southern province, choma district where we paid two thousand, one hundred and fifty five kwacha per term.
19/12/23, 2:41 pm - Gurvinder: May I know what business do your parents do?
19/12/23, 3:18 pm - +260 767735131: My mom sales clothes and my dad is a carpenter
19/12/23, 3:26 pm - Gurvinder: Noted.
19/12/23, 3:26 pm - +260 767735131: Thank you
19/12/23, 3:27 pm - Gurvinder: So has your elder sister Mwila succeeded in getting employment after the degree?
19/12/23, 3:28 pm - +260 767735131: Not yet shes still waiting for employment

19/12/23, 3:33 pm - Gurvinder: So now as we proceed ahead, I have a question, during your introduction you mentioned you would like to study journalism and mass communication, could you please share what motivates you behind this field of study?
19/12/23, 3:38 pm - +260 767735131: Seeing that a lot of people these days go for these courses like nursing and at the end of their study they have struggles in getting jobs, I personally feel journalism is not taken that seriously in Zambia like a lot of people have no interest in studying it and if I was given an opportunity to study journalism abroad I can at least probably learn a lot of different things that here are not taught and when back I share the knowledge and encourage people on what I would learn from there
19/12/23, 4:02 pm - Gurvinder: Your perspective on journalism and mass communication in Zambia is quite true, Kulela. It's true that certain fields, like nursing, often attract many students, sometimes leading to challenges in job opportunities due to high competition. On the other hand, journalism might not be as popular, yet it holds immense potential and significance.
19/12/23, 4:02 pm - Gurvinder: So if I may ask from your family or known circle has anyone pursued a career in this field?
19/12/23, 4:10 pm - +260 767735131: No one has pursued a career in this field and if I do I'll be the first one and even encourage the others
19/12/23, 4:15 pm - Gurvinder: Alright so now can you share your Garde 10 and Grade 12 results for evaluation?
19/12/23, 4:34 pm - +260 767735131: So I'll have to re download my results again which am currently working on can we proceed and I send the results onwards??
19/12/23, 8:50 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
