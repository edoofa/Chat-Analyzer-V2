📅 *Date: 12th December 2023*
🕤 *Time: 11:30 AM CAT*

Please mark the time to ensure you're available for this important counseling session as your active participation is an important parameter for evaluation. To prepare for our session, we encourage you to explore our website at [www.edoofa.com], the video and document shared along. This will provide you with valuable insights into our programs and opportunities. In case the applicant isn't available, parents can initiate the session. Let me know if you have any challenges with the schedule. <This message was edited>

12/12/23, 12:11 pm - Kunal: As per the protocols of the program,the representation of your parents/guardians who will be supporting your education is necessary in the group so that they can follow the sessions and I can address their thoughts and queries directly. As you know higher education is a big decision that requires the support of your family. *So shall we add them to the group?*


In case they are not available right now, they can still be the part of a group and catch up with the conversations later
