*I am Ms. Harmehak, Career Counselor at Edoofa.*

I hope I have contacted the right person?
19/12/23, 3:39 pm - +27 64 981 6126: Yes ,yes
19/12/23, 3:40 pm - Harmehak: It is a pleasure to connect with you today, 

You can address me as *Ms. Harmehak and we do have with us, Mr. Sahil who is the Senior Career Counselor and Mr. Jyotishman who is the Head of Admissions* and will be evaluating your responses for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
19/12/23, 3:40 pm - +27 64 981 6126: I'm grateful for that.
19/12/23, 3:54 pm - Harmehak: So Atoness, I can see you got to know about the program from your friend Diana!

So now can you please tell me, what is your understanding of the Edoofa Scholarship Program and what all did you happen to learn from your friend?
19/12/23, 4:07 pm - +27 64 981 6126: I learnt that the Edoofa Scholarship is in India.

Under the Edoofa Scholarship programme you get to further your studies in an affordable manner.
It was put out to help potential students to study further and it covers
50-100% of studying costs
19/12/23, 4:17 pm - Harmehak: Well received, Atoness, let me share more about the program with you.

You see, *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4000 students from different African countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*

19/12/23, 4:20 pm - +27 64 981 6126: Okay 

I understand that there is high competition indeed.
19/12/23, 4:23 pm - Harmehak: Yes please!
19/12/23, 4:23 pm - Harmehak: I feel you too are looking for something like this, so that just like these students you can cater for your higher education by your own self and help your parents reduce their financial burden, isn't it?
19/12/23, 4:28 pm - +27 64 981 6126: Yes 
It is
19/12/23, 4:31 pm - Harmehak: *Alright so Atoness, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.*

I would like to know you better as a student so please go ahead, tell me a bit about yourself, your education, how much USD Dalpark Learning charges you every term, along with what do you wish to study, your strengths and weaknesses, and your hobbies, since I honestly don't know a lot about you?

And with that a detailed description of your family background, what do your parents do *(Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work)?*, what is their highest education level along with if you have any siblings, please?
19/12/23, 6:48 pm - Harmehak: I would have loved to continue, however, I would be scheduling your session for *tomorrow at 9 AM CAT*, as my working hours for the day are over and it's already been a long day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
