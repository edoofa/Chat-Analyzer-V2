19/12/23, 10:20 am - Pallika Edoofa: That's alright, I want to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*



Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it
19/12/23, 10:20 am - Pallika Edoofa: Also, As your evaluation progresses, I would like to appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country.

We have learnt a lot
Thank you once again
19/12/23, 11:07 am - Pallika Edoofa: Glad to know that, Ms. Hazvenei.
19/12/23, 11:09 am - Pallika Edoofa: Ms. Hazvenei, Proceeding further, I would like to know if he is interested in the Medical field and why he hasn't opted for Physics at A level?
19/12/23, 11:22 am - +263 77 686 2568: The desire to help the health of people and the world pushed him into medical field and it creates employment on its own self_ employed.
19/12/23, 11:22 am - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Ms. Hazvenei, Let me tell you that the requirements vary depending on the country Since Medical Education and Engineering are two aspects for which the Indian Education System is known, both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level: Physics, Chemistry, and Biology. If they want to study any Engineering Course, they should have Physics and Mathematics at their A level mandatorily.
19/12/23, 11:23 am - Pallika Edoofa: Since Taonga does not have Physics, I regret to inform you that he is not eligible for Medicine and Pharmacy, but considering your interest there are better courses from the Medical Field itself that you are eligible for and which can help fulfill your dreams of working in this field
