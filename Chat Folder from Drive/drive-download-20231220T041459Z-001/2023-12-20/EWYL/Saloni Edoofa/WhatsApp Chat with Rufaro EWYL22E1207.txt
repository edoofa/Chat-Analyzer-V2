10/08/23, 6:35 pm - +263 77 378 3220: Hello miss Saloni. Sorry for the late responses, I've been really busy lately.
Unfortunately I cannot proceed with my sessions this holiday because I'm always at school since we have regular classes daily as a way of preparing for our final exams in October. 
After the holiday, I will go back to boarding school aswell.

I deeply apologize for any drawbacks caused. Thank you.

16/12/23, 6:30 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Good evening,

I sincerely hope you're well. It's been a while since we last connected, and as I see many of my students eagerly resuming their EWYL journey after completing their exams, it brings back memories of your passion and enthusiasm when you started yours.

I can't help but wonder why we've lost touch. Your dedication to your goals was inspiring, and your journey holds a special place in my heart. As your mentor, I'm genuinely concerned about your well-being and progress. Please, if there's anything on your mind, don't hesitate to share. I'm here to support you in any way I can.
