18/08/23, 3:45 pm - +91 78273 08969: 2] ADD MENTOR:

Make sure that before you start interacting with the participants in the group that you created for the community-building project, YOU ADD ME.

The purpose of doing this is that:
- I will be able to track your progress and guide you through learning the networking skill
- I will be able to see the concerns raised by students and we can discuss them accordingly.
- I will be able to see whether the right information has been shared with all the students
18/08/23, 3:50 pm - +263 78 898 6662: Ok I will do so first thing when I create the group
18/08/23, 3:52 pm - +91 78273 08969: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about
 Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
18/08/23, 3:52 pm - +91 78273 08969: Hello Friends
I am _______ a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe. 
I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.*

You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I followed the *5’S which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship*.  Make sure you go through the Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached. 
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!
18/08/23, 3:57 pm - +263 78 898 6662: Ok maam  noted

18/08/23, 4:03 pm - +91 78273 08969: You know, Edoofa is also working closely in collaboration with the Zimbabwean Ambassador to India Dr. G.M Chipare. We have had meetings where Dr. Chipare has recommended the Program offer Scholarships to 10000 Zimbabweans within 3 years. Herewith I have attached the photo from our meetings with him.Now, After sharing the above information, Please make sure that you follow up with the student on his/her understanding of the discussion above. After you are satisfied with the student’s response, you will share about Edoofa’s Meet and Greet Session that happened in Harare. I am sharing the messages regarding that below:
 
I would like each one of you to take a look at the video that I am sharing below. The video is regarding Edoofa’s Meet and Greet session where Edoofa’s founders Mr. Angad Singh and Mr. Avreen Singh interacted with various School Principals, African students, and their parents in Harare, Zimbabwe last year.
Please have a look at it and share your thoughts with me.

18/08/23, 4:07 pm - +263 78 898 6662: Ok understood
18/08/23, 4:08 pm - +91 78273 08969: After this, You can interact with students by asking if they have any queries so far or not. Once all the queries have been dealt with, It is now time that we share the Student Application Form with the students and ask them to share it in the group.
Feel free to take my help if you have any doubts regarding the queries that you might get from the students.

18/08/23, 4:17 pm - +91 78273 08969: So Charlene, now comes the interesting part where you will be rewarded with scholarship credits for networking with your connection. 
After the student shares their referral and once they have a personalized counseling session with one of our career counselors just like how you have experienced, the counselor will ask some points of the student regarding how they got to know about Edoofa and if they understand our program structure. I hope you will explain to the student as we have discussed right?
18/08/23, 4:18 pm - +263 78 898 6662: Yes maam I will explain to them.
18/08/23, 4:19 pm - +91 78273 08969: That is all for today, This is the end of this project.

Greetings Mr./Mrs *School Head Name*!
Hope you are doing well.

I am *Your Name* and I am a beneficiary of the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
I stand obliged to get an opportunity to connect with you, I hope to have a result/conclusion-driven conversation with you today.

May I know at what time you will be available to connect via Whatsapp?
23/09/23, 8:56 am - +91 78273 08969: Now let me share some important resources with you that you can share with the School Head.

 Let me introduce you to the scholarship program that is providing me an opportunity to fulfill all my dreams related to higher education - *EDOOFA -Education For All*

To give you an insight about Edoofa, it is a scholarship program initiated by *Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd., INDIA*. Edoofa believes quality education should be accessible to all and not just the privilege of a few. Through our scholarship program that is based on a work-study model, Edoofa solves both problems, that of *a lack of affordability and employability in higher education.* Edoofa stays with the students throughout their academic life as a mentor and caretaker, right from building the application, applying to colleges, training, and making them job-ready. This is an experience that I acknowledge as being a Proud Edoofian!🎉

Edoofa is a *social-for-profit organization* that aims to help deserving students with life-changing opportunities to further their careers through affordable higher education as well as internship opportunities✨.

In short, Edoofa is an embedded higher education program. They stay with the student throughout their academic life as mentors and caretakers, right from building the application, applying to colleges, training, and making them job-ready. This is an experience that I acknowledge being a Proud Edoofian!




Edoofa scholarship program is currently helping over *100 schools in Africa*, and over *3000 African students* are benefiting from our scholarship program. The school principals and teachers who are playing a significant role in our program are enjoying exclusive access to part-time Ph.D. programs. Now, to help the students reduce the financial burden of food and accommodation, Edoofa has its own Earn While You Learn Program, which helps the students to learn skills and earn money in the form of scholarship credits to reduce their expenses.🙌


_Over the past 5 years, after counseling tens of thousands of students, Edoofa has gone in-depth in understanding the problems that students face.

18/10/23, 3:42 pm - +263 78 898 6662: Yes
18/10/23, 3:45 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Can you share any specific ways you think ChatGPT AI might be useful in your studies or future projects based on what we discussed in the last class?
18/10/23, 3:51 pm - +263 78 898 6662: Helps simplify the things im not able to understand. Let's say I can't understand the classification of amino acids in biochem ChatGPT puts it in an understandable way

18/10/23, 4:18 pm - +263 78 898 6662: I hope so
18/10/23, 4:18 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now, I believe you must be aware that three of my students have successfully earned more than $200 in 2 months through this $300 plan.

When I asked them about their progress, they mentioned that sharing their personal experience with the students through a video really helped. Therefore, I think I should share this with my other students as well.
18/10/23, 4:24 pm - +263 78 898 6662: I don't really understand the last part
18/10/23, 4:25 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, so they have created a video. Let me share the highlights with you.

e) Discuss the advantages of being an Edoofian compared to applying through an agent and struggling with the process independently.

18/10/23, 4:40 pm - Ananya Edoofa: So, now I hope you will be able to create a video by Friday evening. Now, let's conclude today's session. We will connect according to our timetable.

- *Eligibility Criteria for an Applicant*
01/11/23, 3:56 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
01/11/23, 3:56 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I guess 3 minutes should be enough to read the first step!

01/11/23, 4:13 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Great, let me share a few more then!
01/11/23, 4:14 pm - Ananya Edoofa: To effectively help students apply for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, we can leverage various channels of communication:

*Facebook Student Community Building Group:*
We recommend creating a dedicated Facebook group exclusively for Edoofa scholarship applicants.
Encourage your peers to join and actively engage with fellow applicants.
Use this group to share important scholarship updates, application tips, and guidance to support one another in the application process.
*Juniors Connect:*
Consider reaching out and mentoring prospective scholarship applicants.
Junior scholars who have successfully navigated the process can share their experiences and offer guidance by answering questions from potential candidates.
*School Friends Juniors Connect:*
Encourage students from your school to connect with junior students who are interested in pursuing higher education through the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
Your school can play a role in facilitating these connections and providing information about the scholarship program.
*Utilize Extracurricular Clubs and Societies/Sports Groups:*
Leverage the existing school clubs, societies, or sports groups to spread the word about the scholarship program.
Leaders of these clubs or coaches can inform their members about this valuable opportunity.
*Parents' Friends/Colleagues:*
Encourage your parents to inform their friends and colleagues who have eligible students about the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
Word-of-mouth recommendations can be incredibly powerful in reaching potential applicants.
*Church Friends (if applicable):*
If you are part of a religious community, consider engaging with your church to reach out to potential scholarship applicants.
Church leaders can assist in sharing information about the scholarship program with their congregations.
*Relatives, Friends of Friends:*
It's essential to encourage students and their families to tap into their extended networks.
Friends of friends, distant relatives, and acquaintances can be informed about the scholarship opportunity.
01/11/23, 4:16 pm - +263 78 898 6662: Understood
01/11/23, 4:17 pm - Ananya Edoofa: In each of these communication channels, it's crucial to provide clear and concise information about the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Ensure that potential applicants are well-informed about eligibility criteria, application deadlines, and the benefits of the scholarship. Additionally, sharing success stories of past scholarship recipients can serve as a source of inspiration and motivation for those considering applying. The ultimate goal is to make the application process accessible and well-informed for all interested students.
01/11/23, 4:17 pm - +263 78 898 6662: Ok noted
01/11/23, 4:20 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now, You know, there have been many instances when you share information about the Edoofa scholarship program; however, students tend to skip it. Later, when counselors inquire, they claim they don't know anything about it. This can lead to a waste of time and a decrease in the quality of your application forms.

Therefore, to avoid this, you have the authority to double-check the information you've shared with the students and ensure they have a clear understanding of it. This will help you guarantee that you have effectively communicated your information. For this, we have another step  *"International Student Admission Eligibility Check"*
01/11/23, 4:23 pm - +263 78 898 6662: yes maam
01/11/23, 4:24 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Let us conclude today's session here. In the next session, we will be discussing this Eligibility check.

As you move forward, you will read the 'International Student Admission Eligibility Check' and some sample questions for verification. I would like you to frame 4-5 questions for yourself by this weekend. I will read them and approve them!
01/11/23, 4:25 pm - +263 78 898 6662: Ok maam noted, thank you
08/11/23, 4:48 pm - Ananya Edoofa: _*Wednesday Wisdom and Saturday activity are back!*_

Well, I understand that it has been a while since we last connected for your Wednesday lesson and Saturday Activity. I realize that all of you had just arrived and were busy settling down, managing your timetables, attending the EWYL sessions, and handling administrative tasks such as processing FRRO and fee-related matters, in addition to your regular classes.

However, starting from now, we will resume our Wednesday Wisdom and weekend activities!
08/11/23, 4:48 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Here is your wednesday lesson!

Today's lesson will revolve around one of the most celebrated festivals in India - Diwali. This vibrant and joyous occasion holds immense significance in the Indian cultural landscape, and it is essential for us to understand its importance and the profound lessons it imparts.

Diwali, also known as the Festival of Lights, is not merely a festival; it is a celebration of light triumphing over darkness, of good prevailing over evil.

09/11/23, 2:53 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings!

I want to inform you that I'll be away from *10th to 13th Nov*, immersed in the vibrant celebrations of Diwali, the festival of lights and triumph of good over evil. Diwali is a time for family, friends, and the warm glow of diyas (traditional lamps). 🪔✨

During this festive break, I won't be available, but fear not! We can catch up on *Tuesday* once the echoes of fireworks settle down. 

Wishing you a Diwali filled with laughter, love, and the sweet taste of festive treats. May the coming days be as colorful and bright as the festival itself! See you soon!✨
09/11/23, 2:53 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well, Diwali is all about celebrating the triumph of light over darkness and good over evil. It's a time when homes are adorned with vibrant decorations, and the air is filled with the sweet scent of festivities.

Now, here's where it gets exciting—I'd love for you to join in on the cultural blend! Imagine this as a global celebration, bringing together the spirit of Diwali with a touch of your own uniqueness. Embrace the lights, colors, and positive vibes that Diwali brings.

Here's a little something for you: Light a candle, even if it's just one, and let it be a symbol of the light that shines within you. Capture the moment by snapping a photo of your candlelit celebration. Share that photograph with me—it's a wonderful way for us to connect across cultures and celebrate the diversity that makes our mentorship journey so special.

Looking forward to witnessing your Diwali celebration, even from afar! 🪔✨ If you have any questions about the festival or just want to share your experience, feel free to drop a message.

Wishing you a Diwali filled with joy, light, and memorable moments! 🎉

25/11/23, 8:27 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Charlene!

Over the past few weeks, I have observed that, due to your classes, exams, and other events, it has been difficult for you to manage calls in the evening. Keeping this in mind, I thought of extending my working hours for you and have changed the timing for the call today.

Time: *7:00 PM*
Video call link: *https://meet.google.com/vwr-sezp-ixr*

25/11/23, 3:34 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Kindly join the call!
25/11/23, 5:36 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *_URGENT_*

Even after many messages and reminders, you have not been able to complete your $300 training session with me. However, since this means a lot to me, and I believe in the impact it will have on your journey, I am here sharing the grant document with you and something discussed during the training.

So, I would like you to read and provide a step-by-step summary of how to proceed with the community-building project. Only after this will you be provided with the "Certified Student Leader" certificate.
25/11/23, 5:36 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
25/11/23, 5:36 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *1. Different channels for finding potential students*

*Facebook Student Community Building Group:*
We recommend creating a dedicated Facebook group exclusively for Edoofa scholarship applicants.
Encourage your peers to join and actively engage with fellow applicants.
Use this group to share important scholarship updates, application tips, and guidance to support one another in the application process.
*Juniors Connect:*
Consider reaching out and mentoring prospective scholarship applicants.
Junior scholars who have successfully navigated the process can share their experiences and offer guidance by answering questions from potential candidates.
*School Friends Juniors Connect:*
Encourage students from your school to connect with junior students who are interested in pursuing higher education through the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
Your school can play a role in facilitating these connections and providing information about the scholarship program.
*Utilize Extracurricular Clubs and Societies/Sports Groups:*
Leverage the existing school clubs, societies, or sports groups to spread the word about the scholarship program.
Leaders of these clubs or coaches can inform their members about this valuable opportunity.
*Parents' Friends/Colleagues:*
Encourage your parents to inform their friends and colleagues who have eligible students about the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
Word-of-mouth recommendations can be incredibly powerful in reaching potential applicants.
*Church Friends (if applicable):*
If you are part of a religious community, consider engaging with your church to reach out to potential scholarship applicants.
Church leaders can assist in sharing information about the scholarship program with their congregations.
*Relatives, Friends of Friends:*
It's essential to encourage students and their families to tap into their extended networks.
Friends of friends, distant relatives, and acquaintances can be informed about the scholarship opportunity.
25/11/23, 5:36 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *2.  As you move forward, you will read the 'International Student Admission Eligibility Check' and some sample questions for verification.*

You know, there have been many instances when you share information about the Edoofa scholarship program; however, students tend to skip it. Later, when counselors inquire, they claim they don't know anything about it. This can lead to a waste of time and a decrease in the quality of your application forms.

Therefore, to avoid this, you have the authority to double-check the information you've shared with the students and ensure they have a clear understanding of it. This will help you guarantee that you have effectively communicated your information. For this, we have another step "International Student Admission Eligibility Check"

Now, as an Edoofa Certified Student Leader, your responsibility is to share these questions with the student, evaluate their answers, and check the student's eligibility.
If you notice any discrepancies, you should guide them to make the necessary corrections before sharing the form with me.

Arthur, This is to remind you that we have our session scheduled for *today at 7:00 PM*

As you move ahead in your academic journey, I am sure you realize the financial responsibility that comes along with it. I can understand how overwhelming it can it initially but let me assure you that without constant discussions we can manage to work to the fullest in the $300 plan. 

Remember that I have set some goals for you and now it has become my personal agenda to see you achieve that.
So, let's make the most of the session so that we can maximize our impact on our progress📈
29/11/23, 1:12 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good evening, Charlene!

After scheduling multiple sessions with you for your $300 training, you could not attend those sessions. Being your mentor, I was concerned about you getting a certificate for student leadership. I even shared the pointers with you without you asking for them. Even after that, you could not share a 4-5 step summary with me?

It breaks my heart to see that even after so many efforts, you never reciprocate, even if these things are for your own benefit. After giving you a lot of days and considering everything, today I will be finalizing the list for Certified Student Leaders at 8:00 PM. If you can, submit your understanding before that.
29/11/23, 1:15 pm - +27 72 686 7018: Good day. She requested that you add her new number on the groups. Kindly assist so that she be part of the conversations.

In our quest for academic excellence and personal growth, understanding and embodying these virtues are fundamental. Honesty, as the bedrock of integrity, plays a pivotal role in shaping our character and building trust within our academic community. We will explore its significance not only in academic pursuits but also in fostering open communication and self-awareness.

I encourage you to come prepared for an engaging discussion, ready to share your insights and experiences related to these virtues. Let's create an environment where we can learn from each other and inspire one another to embody these virtues in our academic and personal lives.

14/12/23, 2:41 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good evening, Charlene!

I understand that you are occupied with your exams and other preparations. However, would it be difficult for you to connect with your mentor for about 15 minutes?

If you have informed me beforehand, that's absolutely fine. But if you have not, don't you think it's basic decency to either inform your mentor or just attend the call for about 15 minutes? That way, I won't be waiting for you during the call.
14/12/23, 6:29 pm - +91 88470 59384: Hello. Sorry but it's been a very tough week from practical exams to tons of make up lectures and CAs. I barely opened my whatsapp this week due to the pressure

You still have not shared your $300 training summary with me, can I know if you are facing any challenges?
15/12/23, 3:57 pm - +91 88470 59384: To be honest it's not really easy to reach out to people in Zimbabwe due to the economic challenges therefore it's hard to get feedback from them
