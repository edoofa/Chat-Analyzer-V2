Let's begin with our session.
01/08/23, 2:28 pm - +263 78 743 3924: Good afternoon Ms Sharda, I am ready for the session.
01/08/23, 2:33 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
01/08/23, 2:38 pm - +263 78 743 3924: No ma'am I don't have any idea.
01/08/23, 2:41 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
01/08/23, 2:42 pm - Sharda Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
01/08/23, 2:43 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*
01/08/23, 2:43 pm - Sharda Edoofa: *Ms. Deepali* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students.

Both Ms. Deepali and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skillset through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts
01/08/23, 2:44 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Before we move forward, I wanted to know about the progress of your arrival to India. Have you already initiated the Visa process, or is it already completed?

09/08/23, 2:41 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Now, Typically, at this stage, we would delve into discussing the projects that you will undertake to earn credits. However, considering your ongoing VISA process and the additional documentation you'll be occupied with, I can totally understand your situation that you will be heavily busy and also you would have to travel a lot due to the documentation, so as your mentor, I would not want to overburden you with the projects at this time as I want your full focus and dedication towards EWYL journey so to ensure your thorough understanding of the projects, it would be more convenient to commence your EWYL journey after you arrive in India.
09/08/23, 2:41 pm - Sharda Edoofa: By adopting this approach, we guarantee that you will have a lot of time and unwavering focus to work on the projects, enabling you to extract the utmost value from your EWYL experience. Moreover, I am thrilled to inform you that I eagerly anticipate your arrival, as it promises to enhance the overall excitement and success of your journey. Rest assured, we are committed to ensuring that your EWYL experience is flawlessly executed, convenient, and maximally efficient.
09/08/23, 2:44 pm - +263 78 743 3924: OK man Sharda, I understand.
09/08/23, 2:45 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Imagine that you are a wizard, and you possess a magical spell that can transform your life and empower you to achieve your dreams. This spell is simple yet powerful, and all you have to do is recite a few words every day. By chanting "I am a proud Edoofian" on the EWYL group, you will activate this spell and unlock a world of possibilities.
09/08/23, 2:45 pm - Sharda Edoofa: As an Edoofian, you are part of a special community of people who share a common goal - to achieve success and advance in life. By repeating this affirmation every day, you are reminding yourself of your purpose, your mission, and your identity as an ambitious and driven individual. You are telling the universe that you are proud of who you are, and that you are ready to take on any challenge that comes your way.
But this affirmation is more than just words. It is a symbol of your commitment to your dreams, your passion for learning, and your desire to make a difference in the world. It is a way to connect with your fellow Edoofians, to share your struggles and your triumphs, and to support each other on your journey to success.
09/08/23, 2:48 pm - +263 78 743 3924: Well said, I will start shouting now "I am a proud EDOOFIAN".
09/08/23, 2:51 pm - +263 78 743 3924: I am very happy happy that very soon  I will be able to meet with other fellow Edoofians in India, so that we will commence our journey together as a team.
09/08/23, 2:51 pm - Sharda Edoofa: So every day, when you recite these words, feel the power and the magic that they contain. Visualize yourself as a proud Edoofian, standing tall and strong, with the world at your feet. Let this affirmation fill you with confidence, hope, and with the knowledge that you are part of something special. And watch as your life transforms before your eyes, as you become the best version of yourself, and as you achieve everything you have ever wanted.
09/08/23, 2:52 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Indeed, you should definitely be happy
09/08/23, 2:52 pm - +263 78 743 3924: Thank you.

23/08/23, 3:19 pm - +263 78 743 3924: It is a task whereby I should be looking for companies that must be student centric. These companies  must not be too big or small in scale. The founder of the company must have a strong background for example how successful he is.
There are platforms to be used to look for such companies for example LinkedIn and Google.
When using Google for searching, I can look for startup news so I get links for many platforms. Moreover, using LinkedIn I will begin connection with founders of few startups.

The central theme of Rakhi is the unbreakable bond between brothers and sisters.

In return, brothers shower their sisters with gifts and a promise to stand by them through thick and thin.
29/08/23, 4:47 pm - Sharda Edoofa: As a result, there will be no sessions tomorrow, allowing me to fully engage in this special occasion with my loved ones. I encourage you all to take this time to learn more about Rakhi, its traditions, and the values it promotes.

It's quite disheartening to observe that you haven't managed to spare *enough time to share your Facebook and Google reviews* with me. I see only two conceivable explanations for this:

2. You're *postponing it*, intending to do it at your leisure.

If there is any other reason, I am happy to understand that. If neither of these reasons applies, I expect you to submit them by *12 PM tomorrow!*

25/11/23, 3:35 pm - Sharda Edoofa: As we navigate through the academic year, I believe it's crucial for us to reflect on the values that drive our individual and collective growth. One such value that plays a significant role in our personal and academic development is the "Spirit of Competition."

As part of your Saturday activity you are required to share your understanding of the Spirit of Competition. What does it mean to you? How has it influenced your approach to challenges and goals? 

Additionally, I encourage you to accompany your thoughts with a real-life example where your Spirit of Competition played a pivotal role in achieving success. Whether it's an academic accomplishment, a personal goal, or an extracurricular pursuit.

Please submit your reflections and success stories before our upcoming session. Thank you for your participation, and I look forward to reading your valuable insights.

29/11/23, 2:59 pm - Sharda Edoofa: I understand that engaging students can be challenging, but let's view this as an opportunity for creative problem-solving. To address their disinterest, consider incorporating more interactive elements into your outreach. Perhaps organize a Q&A session, share success stories, or even host a virtual event to generate curiosity. Tailoring your approach to their interests and concerns can make a significant impact. Remember, education is not just about delivering information but also about creating an environment that sparks curiosity and engagement. Let's strategize together to make your outreach more compelling and effective.
