Thank you so much asking wonderful questions.

Excuse me for the delay in reply as it was a holiday yesterday.
21/08/23, 9:03 am - Sharda Edoofa: Yes, you can work elseehere like do internships or some other work to earn money.

It is completely up to you how often you want to visit your parents.But, it is advised that you visit them during semester breaks so that you do not miss your classes and balance your academics as well. 
Keep in mind the calculation of travel costs and other finances. Yes, your parents can visit you anytime, it's just you have to free.

No, it is not compulsory to stay on campus. If you want you can choose off campus accommodation. And a lot of our students stay off campus because it is comparatively cheaper as well.

If you stay on Campus your mess fees will be included and you will get the meals like breakfast, lunch, dinner and if you stay off campus it is totally up to you how you want your meals to be like. For example, you can choose to cook on your own, you can avail tiffin services, and go and dine in restaurants.
Again, it is completely up to you.

If you have any further questions do let me know and I will be more than happy to answer.

For the time being, *Our sessions will be held every day from 2:00 pm to 3:00 pm from Monday to Friday*
23/08/23, 2:30 pm - Sharda Edoofa: So, During your EWYL Journey
23/08/23, 2:30 pm - Sharda Edoofa: 1. You will be meeting me two days a week. It can be either Monday and Thursday or Tuesday and Friday.

23/08/23, 2:31 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Now what you learn through the theory of Wednesday wisdom, you will be implementing the same in our Saturday Activities, these will be simple yet testing tasks that you are required to complete.

A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you.

On this day, sisters tie a colorful thread (the rakhi) around their brothers' wrists as a symbol of their love, protection, and lifelong commitment to each other. In return, brothers shower their sisters with gifts and a promise to stand by them through thick and thin.
29/08/23, 4:46 pm - Sharda Edoofa: As a result, there will be no sessions tomorrow, allowing me to fully engage in this special occasion with my loved ones. I encourage you all to take this time to learn more about Rakhi, its traditions, and the values it promotes.

15/09/23, 9:20 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Kudzai

I hope you are doing well. You know, in order to proceed with further arrangements like admissions and scholarship credits, every student should complete these initial sessions where we discuss the session outline, credits, and projects. If we put these sessions on hold, you might lag behind.

I understand your situation, and I know you have your exams coming up. I definitely want you to not compromise on your studies and give your best. Therefore, in order to help you and prevent you from falling behind, I am willing to extend my working hours.
15/09/23, 9:21 pm - +27 68 201 6689: Good evening
15/09/23, 9:22 pm - +27 68 201 6689: Since Kudzai is in school can l stand for her as l did in the first sessions
15/09/23, 9:28 pm - Sharda Edoofa: I am considering two options:

1)  Your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days. You can choose your slot.
*Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: 8:30 am to 9:30 am*
OR
*Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: 2:00 pm to 3:00 pm* 

2) You can attend a session on Saturday yourself. Please be regular because we don't usually have sessions on Saturdays at:
*8:30 am to 9:30 am*

This way, I will be able to mark your attendance, and all your further proceedings will be secure and smooth. Please let me know your thoughts on this.
15/09/23, 9:28 pm - Sharda Edoofa: okay noted.
17/09/23, 8:51 am - +27 68 201 6689: Morning
17/09/23, 8:52 am - +27 68 201 6689: The afternoon session will be fine

I hope you are doing well

Kindly text me five minutes prior to our sesssion saying you are reday for the session.
18/09/23, 2:26 pm - Sharda Edoofa: I am doing good. Thank you so much for asking.
18/09/23, 2:26 pm - +27 68 201 6689: Welcome
18/09/23, 2:31 pm - Sharda Edoofa: For the most part of the EWYL journey, the students would work uopn three major projects to learn & earn as many scholarship credits as they can and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects that Kudzai will be a part of. Let me know once you have gone through the same.
18/09/23, 2:31 pm - Sharda Edoofa: <Media omitted>
18/09/23, 2:36 pm - +27 68 201 6689: Okay thanks

19/09/23, 2:49 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how Kudzai can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-
19/09/23, 2:49 pm - Sharda Edoofa: 1. Give your best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss your EWYL sessions without informing your mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share your challenges and the things you’re good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make your mentor trust you fully
19/09/23, 2:49 pm - Sharda Edoofa: I hope we are on the same page?
19/09/23, 2:50 pm - +27 68 201 6689: Yes we're.  Thanks

19/09/23, 2:51 pm - Sharda Edoofa: FIRST- To choose a batch for his/her sessions. Either it has to be 
*MONDAY and THURSDAY*
or 
*TUESDAY and FRIDAY*
19/09/23, 2:52 pm - +27 68 201 6689: Okay thank you
19/09/23, 2:53 pm - Sharda Edoofa: SECOND- In our sessions (that will be happening on the days Kudzai will choose), we will discuss the weekend activity or the Wednesday lesson plus the projects and the newsletter.
19/09/23, 2:57 pm - +27 68 201 6689: Oh OK
19/09/23, 3:00 pm - Sharda Edoofa: THIRD- All our conversations from now on will take forward in the EWYL Line.
Edoofa EWYL (contact)
19/09/23, 3:00 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Either you can make the decision on behalf of Kudzai, or he/she can be active for a few minutes in the session tomorrow and let us know what timetable would be most suited for him/her to proceed with once he is back from school.
19/09/23, 3:09 pm - +27 68 201 6689: I will check with her but the chances are slim because she will be in class
20/09/23, 2:16 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Greetings!

By the way, Dussehra, a significant Hindu festival, just happened recently. It's a celebration of good triumphing over evil, and it's a time for joy and reflection. I'd appreciate your insights if you were already familiar with this festival.
Wishing you all the best in your exams.

I have noticed your unresponsiveness in the group. I would like to understand if everything is alright at your end. 

We're delighted to share that some of our students have been actively engaging in extracurricular activities, such as a recent basketball tournament, where they showcased their skills and teamwork.

Additionally, I am excited to inform you that after our students come to India, we also host regular gatherings where students come together, enjoy conversations, and even sing together. These events provide a warm sense of community, and our *Edoofa Welfare officer* joins in to make them even more special.

I am keen to know about your preferences as well. What kind of activities would you like to get involved in after coming to India? Whether it's sports, cultural events, or any other interests, please share your thoughts.

As we embark on today's session, let's kick-start our journey with a dose of inspiration from Jeff Bezos, the visionary founder of Amazon:

Your brand is what other people say about you when you're not in the room
Now, what does this mean to you?
Imagine you're creating your personal brand every day. It's not just about how you see yourself; it's about the impression you leave on others. Whether you're in the classroom, chatting with friends, or pursuing your hobbies, you're shaping your brand—the way people perceive you.

So, let's dive into today's session with the mindset of crafting a brand that reflects your strengths, values, and aspirations. Together, we'll explore ways to amplify your unique qualities and set the stage for success, not just academically, but in every aspect of your lives.

Remember, each interaction, each achievement, contributes to your brand. Let's make it a story of growth, resilience, and positive impact!
