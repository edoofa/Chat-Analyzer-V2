You have won the *Grant challenge*! Your dedication, hard work, and innovative thinking have truly paid off, and I couldn't be happier for you.🌟

I believe this accomplishment calls for a dedicated session to delve deeper into the details. I would like to offer you the opportunity to have a focused discussion about the grant and its implications. Let's set up a session on *Wednesday 16th of August at 10:00am CAT AND 1:30PM Indian Time.* to go over everything in more detail.

To prepare for our discussion, I have attached a copy of the *grant letter* for your review. It outlines the terms and conditions of the grant, and having a solid understanding of its contents will allow us to have a productive conversation.

Please take some time to read through the grant letter before our session so that we can address any questions or concerns you may have. During our meeting, we can explore the next steps, expectations, and how this grant aligns with your broader goals.🚀

17/08/23, 8:47 am - +91 78273 08969: The reasons behind Edoofa's creation of the Grant Challenge and its importance in students' development is that numerous students are putting in a lot of effort and commitment, but unfortunately, their hard work doesn't always lead to success. This is why we introduced the Grants – to support those students whom we believe possess remarkable potential and can achieve remarkable accomplishments

They are designed to spark a flame within you. This flame should drive you to exceed your boundaries and attain remarkable progress within the Earn While You Learn Program.
Moreover, these grants also act as a source of encouragement for many people who have hidden talents. Your amazing progress and changes show others how they can do great things by leaving their comfort zones. In simple words, you become a role model who inspires others to overcome their limits and make the most of their abilities.
17/08/23, 8:51 am - +263 78 660 1672: That is great, very encouraging.

17/08/23, 9:02 am - +263 78 660 1672: The Grant Challenge serves as a helping hand to students are believed to be able to achieve remarkable accomplishments which is seen through their hard work.

You have proved your mettle, and it is now with great pride that we entrust you with this responsibility.

As your mentor, I want you to know that I truly understand the challenges posed by your classes, tests, and other assignments, which can make it difficult for you to attend our calls on weekdays.

In light of this, I'm excited to share some adjustments to our schedule.

 *Week 1*: Whatsapp session on Wednesday 
📍EWYL Group
⏳06:00-06:45 PM

 *Week 2*: Call on Saturday
📅: 21/10/2023

📍EWYL Group
⏳06:00-06:45 PM

I understand that as a mentor, I might have to go through the extra mile, but I want you to know that your progress is of utmost importance to me, and if you are willing to meet me midway,  I believe this new schedule will be more manageable for you and we can proceed with our journey of EWYL for you to become a successful professional!

25/10/23, 3:21 pm - Sharda Edoofa: You know, *Takunda*, it has been a while since we introduced the $300 plan to you.

whatsapp...instagram and facebook...
25/10/23, 3:45 pm - Sharda Edoofa: To effectively help students apply for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, we can leverage various channels of communication:
*Facebook Student Community Building Group:*

Encourage your peers to join and actively engage with fellow applicants.
Use this group to share important scholarship updates, application tips, and guidance to support one another in the application process.

Consider reaching out and mentoring prospective scholarship applicants.
Junior scholars who have successfully navigated the process can share their experiences and offer guidance by answering questions from potential candidates.

25/10/23, 3:48 pm - +263 78 660 1672: yes ma'am...

Your school can play a role in facilitating these connections and providing information about the scholarship program.

*Utilize Extracurricular Clubs and Societies/Sports Groups:*
Leverage the existing school clubs, societies, or sports groups to spread the word about the scholarship program.
Leaders of these clubs or coaches can inform their members about this valuable opportunity.
25/10/23, 3:59 pm - Sharda Edoofa: *Parents' Friends/Colleagues:*
Encourage your parents to inform their friends and colleagues who have eligible students about the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
Word-of-mouth recommendations can be incredibly powerful in reaching potential applicants.

*Church Friends (if applicable):*
If you are part of a religious community, consider engaging with your church to reach out to potential scholarship applicants.
Church leaders can assist in sharing information about the scholarship program with their congregations.
25/10/23, 3:59 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Is everything clear until now, Takunda?
25/10/23, 4:05 pm - +263 78 660 1672: yes ma'am...
25/10/23, 4:42 pm - Sharda Edoofa: *Relatives, Friends of Friends:*
It's essential to encourage students and their families to tap into their extended networks.

25/10/23, 4:47 pm - Sharda Edoofa: In each of these communication channels, it's crucial to provide clear and concise information about the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Ensure that potential applicants are well-informed about eligibility criteria, application deadlines, and the benefits of the scholarship. Additionally, sharing success stories of past scholarship recipients can serve as a source of inspiration and motivation for those considering applying. The ultimate goal is to make the application process accessible and well-informed for all interested students.

26/10/23, 4:32 pm - +263 78 660 1672: Good evening ma'am...

a) Your journey so far with the Edoofa Scholarship Program,
b) Initial apprehensions that you had during the counseling stage.

d) Your initial feedback on how life is different in India, how their basic amenities are cheaper as compared to their homeland (For example - Cheap Internet and unlimited calls).
e) Advantages of being an Edoofian as compared to applying on your own through an agent and struggling with the process.

26/10/23, 4:36 pm - +263 78 660 1672: Okay ma'am...I will record it and share it with you...

I hope you are doing well.

 it has been while since I have been constantly reminding of the due video that was supposed to be done long time ago.
I hope you understand that I take extra time out of my schedule just to check your performance and share reminders to you so that you do not miss out on opportunities that other students are receiving by completing the assigned tasks to them on a regular and timely basis. 

I hope you consider this a priority and share your video latest by tomorrow. If you feel that this task is not important, I encourage you to share your concerns transparently with me so that I can explain the objective of it in the first place.

I'd like to kick off this session with a motivating quote by Robert Frost: "Two roads diverged in a wood, and I took the one less traveled by, and that has made all the difference."

08/11/23, 3:25 pm - +263 78 660 1672: Basically the PDF is teaching me on the ways to be able to convince and communicate with students for example Transparency, honesty and having authentic conversations with the students. While doing so I can even share my stories and experiences with Edoofa on how it helped me and still is. I am also supposed to check if they are really eligible for the scholarship and how serious and determined they are. I will also inform them on why I chose Edoofa scholarship over other Scholarships and how they are taken care of from arrival and till the last day of their course...

Also the reason of choosing India being that India has many similarities with Zimbabwe as they were both British colonies...
08/11/23, 3:26 pm - Sharda Edoofa: This is a very appropriate understanding, Takunda.
08/11/23, 3:27 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Let me explain the four steps that you have to follow that have also been discussed in the document.
08/11/23, 3:27 pm - Sharda Edoofa: *Step 1: Outreach*

08/11/23, 3:27 pm - Sharda Edoofa: *Step 2: Information Sharing* 
Once we've identified potential candidates, This will be crucial in helping candidates understand what Edoofa is all about.
08/11/23, 3:27 pm - Sharda Edoofa: *Step 3: Eligibility Check*
Now, here's where you'll play a pivotal role. After sharing program information, you'll ask potential candidates to answer specific questions to ensure they truly understand what Edoofa offers.

Please add any additional questions you think might help in assessing the candidates' understanding.
08/11/23, 3:27 pm - Sharda Edoofa: *Step 4: Evaluation and Sharing* 
After collecting the answers, you'll evaluate them. Only those who show a clear understanding of the program will be eligible to receive the Edoofa Application form. If any candidate needs further clarification or has misconceptions, please guide them and share the right information.
Your role is crucial in ensuring that we're reaching out to the most deserving and informed applicants. Let's work together to make this process smooth and successful.
08/11/23, 3:29 pm - +263 78 660 1672: Okay ma'am...I will definitely use those above mentioned steps...I will carefully look out for other students who deserve to be part of the Edoofa family.
08/11/23, 3:31 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Now, as an *Edoofa Certified Student Leader*, your responsibility is to share these questions with the student, evaluate their answers, and check the student's eligibility.
If you notice any discrepancies, you should guide them to make the necessary corrections before sharing the form with me.
As you proceed with the document, you should have also reviewed the available resources that provide quality answers to frequently asked questions. You can use these resources to enhance your conversations.
08/11/23, 3:31 pm - Sharda Edoofa: 1) How to apply and fast-track your application process in the Edoofa Scholarship Program? 

2) Why did I choose the Edoofa Program over other agents and consultants? 

3) Before you ask me what the Earn While You Learn Program (EWYL) is, let me explain to you the uniqueness of the Edoofa Program. The Edoofa Program is the only International Education?

4) Why INDIA is a dream destination for Education for Africans?
08/11/23, 3:31 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Now that I have shared the basic protocols to be followed within the training program, I would like you to provide a step-by-step summary of how to proceed with the community-building project. I expect that you can do this in 5-6 minutes or less.
08/11/23, 3:34 pm - +263 78 660 1672: Okay ma'am...
08/11/23, 3:47 pm - +263 78 660 1672: Firstly, I have advertise the Edoofa scholarship and scout for those who look interested. 
Further, I will share with them the information about Edoofa and Educate them about it...in this I can use my own personal story and experiences with Edoofa.
Furthermore, I will have to ask them questions to see if they really understood what I was sharing with them and also this servers as a way to see if they are paying attention and serious about the Scholarship. If they seem lost I will explain to them again to make sure they do understand what is the purpose, the services and the advantages of being under Edoofa scholarship.
Also, I evaluate the answers of the students to see it it makes them to qualify to be part of the Edoofa family. If so I will share their form with you and if there is any further clarification I will have to make sure the student fully understands what the Edoofa scholarship is about and the services...

As we navigate through the academic year, I believe it's crucial for us to reflect on the values that drive our individual and collective growth. One such value that plays a significant role in our personal and academic development is the "Spirit of Competition."

As part of your Saturday activity you are required to share your understanding of the Spirit of Competition. What does it mean to you? How has it influenced your approach to challenges and goals? 

Additionally, I encourage you to accompany your thoughts with a real-life example where your Spirit of Competition played a pivotal role in achieving success. Whether it's an academic accomplishment, a personal goal, or an extracurricular pursuit.

Please submit your reflections and success stories before our upcoming session. Thank you for your participation, and I look forward to reading your valuable insights.

I hope this message finds you well. Today's Saturday activity is designed to help us get familiar with Microsoft Excel, a powerful tool for data organization and analysis. We'll begin with a simple yet practical exercise: creating a Weekly Activity Log and Time Tracker.

Activity Instructions:

Open Microsoft Excel:

Launch Microsoft Excel on your computer or phone. If you don't have it installed, you can use any spreadsheet software available to you.
Set Up Columns:

Create three columns with the following headers: "Activity," "Day of the Week," and "Time Spent (in minutes)."
Record Your Activities:

Think about the activities you engaged in during the past week, such as studying, exercising, or socializing.
In the "Activity" column, list each activity separately.
Specify Days:

In the "Day of the Week" column, record the corresponding day for each activity.
Log Time:

In the "Time Spent" column, record the amount of time (in minutes) you spent on each activity.
Calculate Average Time:

Utilize Excel functions to calculate the average time spent per activity and the overall average time for the week.
Reflect:

In a designated area, jot down a brief reflection on your insights from tracking activities and time spent.
Save and Submit:

Save the file with an appropriate name (e.g., "WeeklyActivityLog_YourName.xlsx").
Submit the completed spreadsheet following the instructions provided.

Remember, this activity serves as an introduction to Microsoft Excel, and we'll build on these skills in future sessions. Feel free to reach out if you encounter any challenges during the activity.

Let's dive in and make the most of today's exploration of Excel!

I hope you are doing well

Let's kick off today's session with a quote from the tech maestro, Sundar Pichai:
*"Success is not about the destination. It's about the journey."*

🌟 What it Means:
Imagine your favorite video game. Sure, finishing a level is awesome, but the real joy? It's in navigating the challenges, learning new skills, and enjoying the process.

Similarly, Sundar Pichai's quote reminds us that success isn't just reaching goals—it's about embracing the adventure, learning, and growing along the way. So, let's dive into today's lesson with the spirit of enjoying the journey!
12/12/23, 2:39 pm - +263 78 660 1672: good evening ma'am...
12/12/23, 2:40 pm - Sharda Edoofa: How are you doing Takunda?
12/12/23, 2:40 pm - +263 78 660 1672: I am fine ma'am...I hope you are also doing great,,,
12/12/23, 2:41 pm - Sharda Edoofa: I am glad to know this. I am good too, thank you so much for asking.
12/12/23, 2:42 pm - +263 78 660 1672: my pleasure...
12/12/23, 2:43 pm - Sharda Edoofa: I am so excited to finally bring out the much-awaited opportunity that you have been waiting for! This is a wonderful time for me as a mentor as a lot of my students are in the process of making use of the Edoofa Grant that was allocated before the start of this academic year and I am sure that you would be curious too.
12/12/23, 2:43 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Before I get into the details of the grant and the process of its redemption, I would like to talk about the 21-day Grant challenge (or the moment when the Grant was allocated to you by the founders of Edoofa - Mr. Angad & Mr. Avreen Singh); that was conducted when you were back home. I trust that you recall participating in this challenge, where you were awarded a grant of $200 annually. 
Do you remember this?
12/12/23, 2:44 pm - +263 78 660 1672: yes I am ma'am...
12/12/23, 2:45 pm - +263 78 660 1672: I remember it ma'am...
12/12/23, 2:45 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Excellent Takunda, on the same lines, do you remember the guidelines that were mentioned in the Grant Letter? I hope you recall that to make the most of the grant money and redeem it, it was important to satisfy a few guidelines that were stated obediently and thoroughly. 
Can you recall what they were?
12/12/23, 2:47 pm - +263 78 660 1672: not really...
12/12/23, 2:47 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Don’t worry, let me help you out on this, 

1. You can redeem either the Edoofa Grant or the scholarship credits earned by you during the year, whichever is higher. You cannot redeem both amounts. 

2. You are required to maintain a minimum of 75% attendance in the respective university classes.
12/12/23, 2:47 pm - Sharda Edoofa: 3. The University fee is to be strictly paid within the timeline prescribed by the university. The Grant would only be disbursed to the University only if the remaining fee (Total Fee for the semester minus Grant Amount) for that semester is cleared as per the deadline shared by the University.

4. A Minimum of 75% attendance in the Earn While You Learn Program during the year, including submission/participation rate in EWYL weekly activities/lessons, webinars, orientation & project submissions.
12/12/23, 2:48 pm - +263 78 660 1672: okay...yea I recall...
12/12/23, 2:49 pm - +263 78 660 1672: thank you ma'am...
12/12/23, 3:06 pm - Sharda Edoofa: You are welcome please.
12/12/23, 3:06 pm - Sharda Edoofa: I've been your mentor for the past few months, and it's been a pleasure watching your progress every week since your arrival in India. I've been keeping tabs on your weekly calls, sessions, and webinars, making sure you're staying on top of the tasks I've assigned, like submitting reviews, attending the orientation, and testimonial videos, etc. It's all part of making sure you make the most out of this fantastic opportunity.
12/12/23, 3:06 pm - Sharda Edoofa: The students who are doing well are the ones who consistently attend these sessions, basically, those who stay in touch with their mentors regularly. *And, remember, these are the only students who would be on the winning side of this opportunity this semester!*
12/12/23, 3:08 pm - +263 78 660 1672: yeah sure ma'am...
12/12/23, 3:11 pm - +263 78 660 1672: and it's nice having you as my mentor...you've been guiding me along the correct path...and encouraging me which has really been very helpful...I appreciate you very much...
12/12/23, 3:11 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Let’s get the ball rolling, I actually wanted to draw comparisons on where you currently stand in terms of attending your sessions regularly and showing up on various activities that our Edoofians are supposed to perform in order to avail the benefits of the Grant, however, that being said, it is essential that you understand of the core belief behind the grant - to perform on the projects and earn as many scholarship credits as possible.
12/12/23, 3:12 pm - Sharda Edoofa: As you must be aware you are expected to attend all the sessions, webinars, and physical orientation sessions that take place, the eligibility criteria for all of them is merely 75% as per your grant letter.
12/12/23, 3:12 pm - +263 78 660 1672: I am aware ma'am...
12/12/23, 3:15 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Great!
12/12/23, 3:19 pm - Sharda Edoofa: To make it simple for you to understand - considering a total of 10 sessions have taken place with me (2 in September & 4 in October& 4 in November), 8 webinars (4 in September & 2 in October& 2 in November), positive attendance in the orientation session that took place at your University, you currently stand at:
12/12/23, 3:28 pm - Sharda Edoofa: <Media omitted>
12/12/23, 3:28 pm - +263 78 660 1672: okay ma'am...
12/12/23, 3:38 pm - Sharda Edoofa: This message was deleted
12/12/23, 3:38 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Now that we are on the same page, as of Sept & Oct, you are not eligible to make use of your grant amount. However, that does not mean that you don't get to be eligible anymore. With our collaborative efforts, we can bridge this gap very easily and I have full faith in you.  I hope you have realized from our conversations earlier that the only aspect required here is your engagement with me and following the path that I am directing you to. Do you believe that you are ready to put your 100% effort into this?
12/12/23, 3:38 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Also, I can completely understand that you would have been occupied in University classes, assignments, and exams but let me highlight the story of our student Nicassio Simbarashe, who was given the grant opportunity and without compromising any call, any day, he worked on the projects with his utmost attention, attended all the webinars and session with his mentor without fail. For him, it was not an added responsibility, but he considered Edoofa and the time given by his mentor crucial for his personal and professional growth. Making him one of our top earners and best performers.
12/12/23, 3:39 pm - Sharda Edoofa: My aim is not to compare you with any other student but to help build a benchmark for you that we have a big scope for improvement and to showcase our best performance.
12/12/23, 3:42 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Are you there in the session, Takunda?
12/12/23, 4:26 pm - +263 78 660 1672: I am ma'am...
12/12/23, 4:28 pm - +263 78 660 1672: Sorry ma'am had left for dinner the dinning was closing early today...
12/12/23, 4:37 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Are you available now?
12/12/23, 4:38 pm - Sharda Edoofa: I also want to highlight a special case -  one of our students has earned 600 as scholarship credits and I sincerely want to appreciate Tadiwanashe for the same. Isn’t it amazing?

 Do you know why I shared this with you? Because I want you to think of the long-term picture, you might be in a position to use these credits for the coming term, but what about next year, next to next year?
I have planned the best way by which you can perform well and make the most of this opportunity. Remember again, our objective will always be with us to _self-finance our studies and reduce the financial burden from our parents to the fullest_
12/12/23, 4:39 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Have a look at this so that we can discuss how you can achieve it
12/12/23, 4:39 pm - Sharda Edoofa: <Media omitted>
12/12/23, 4:40 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Witnessing your current progress and the credits you're earning is truly inspiring. It gives me confidence that you have untapped potential that can truly turn the tables in their favor. I firmly believe in your ability to reach greater heights.
12/12/23, 4:41 pm - Sharda Edoofa: By actively engaging with the mentor through sessions and calls, you have the potential to earn more with every coming academic year. You have the capability not only to alleviate the current financial load but also to pave the way for a future where education becomes a self-financed journey. This isn't just about credits; it's about empowering you to shape a brighter educational and financial future and that I believe, is incomplete without consistent communication and consistency.

13/12/23, 1:22 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Happy Wednesday, Takunda🌻

I hope this message finds you well. As we gear up for another enriching session this Wednesday, I wanted to inform you of the exciting topic we will be delving into – the virtues of honesty and hard work.

In our quest for academic excellence and personal growth, understanding and embodying these virtues are fundamental. Honesty, as the bedrock of integrity, plays a pivotal role in shaping our character and building trust within our academic community. We will explore its significance not only in academic pursuits but also in fostering open communication and self-awareness.

Additionally, we will dive into the realm of hard work – a virtue that propels us towards success. From setting realistic goals to managing our time efficiently, the commitment to hard work is a key ingredient in the recipe for achievement.🌟

I encourage you to come prepared for an engaging discussion, ready to share your insights and experiences related to these virtues. Let's create an environment where we can learn from each other and inspire one another to embody these virtues in our academic and personal lives.

Looking forward to our Wednesday session and the insightful conversations that are sure to unfold.🤝

Best regards,
Team EWYL
