15/09/23, 9:23 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Morning
I hope you are doing well. You know, in order to proceed with further arrangements like admissions and scholarship credits, every student should complete these initial sessions where we discuss the session outline, credits, and projects. If we put these sessions on hold, you might lag behind.

I understand your situation, and I know you have your exams coming up. I definitely want you to not compromise on your studies and give your best. Therefore, in order to help you and prevent you from falling behind, I am willing to extend my working hours.
15/09/23, 9:36 am - Jasmine Edoofa: I am considering two options:

1)  Your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days. You can choose your slot.
*Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday: 8:30 am to 9:30 am*
OR
*Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday: 1:30 pm to 2:30 pm* 

2) You can attend a session on Saturday yourself. Please be regular because we don't usually have sessions on Saturdays at:
*8:30 am to 9:30 am*

This way, I will be able to mark your attendance, and all your further proceedings will be secure and smooth. Please let me know your thoughts on this.
15/09/23, 5:38 pm - +263 77 432 3043: We are fine how are you
15/09/23, 5:38 pm - +263 77 432 3043: As parents  let us have the sessions on Monday  Tuesday and  Wednesday  from 130 pm to 2: 30 pm
18/09/23, 4:45 pm - +263 77 341 5211: Yes  ma'am.  My parents  will  do it  on my behalf  then I will join  over the  weekend
19/09/23, 11:08 am - Jasmine Edoofa: *Good Morning* 
I hope you are in great spirits. *I would like to remind you that you have your session scheduled at 1:30 p.m* So are you ready for the session?
19/09/23, 11:51 am - +263 77 341 5211: Morning  ma'am.  Ok  I will be  connected on the said time
19/09/23, 12:51 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Afternoon, 
How are you doing?
19/09/23, 1:10 pm - +263 77 341 5211: Iam fine ma'am
19/09/23, 1:13 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Great,  I'd like to tell you about the EWYL team. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our two key objectives are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
19/09/23, 1:17 pm - +263 77 341 5211: I guess the objectives are of admissions and  credits
19/09/23, 1:18 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Okay, let me elaborate
19/09/23, 1:18 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the first goal is to ensure that all Edoofians have an equal opportunity to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a systematic program/curriculum in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring that Tanaka is prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach her professional goals.
19/09/23, 1:20 pm - +263 77 341 5211: Okay thanks.  Understood
19/09/23, 1:26 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: The second goal is to help all our edoofians self-finance their education, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of the student’s tuition fees.
19/09/23, 1:29 pm - +263 77 341 5211: Noted
19/09/23, 1:31 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the EWYL team. 
Ms.Sanjana is the Head of the Department and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students.
19/09/23, 1:37 pm - +263 77 341 5211: Great thanks. Noted
19/09/23, 1:39 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: We also have Ms. Davi, the Head coach is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
19/09/23, 1:43 pm - +263 77 341 5211: Okay ma'am.  I appreciate their assistance and  presence
19/09/23, 1:44 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates you to connect with us over a minimum of 4 times a week i.eThe student will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that the students practically execute what they learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
19/09/23, 1:50 pm - +263 77 341 5211: Clear and  understood  ma'am
19/09/23, 1:52 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly newsletters as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, Mr. Angad Singh connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once NAME forms a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 05 minutes should be enough.
19/09/23, 1:52 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
19/09/23, 2:05 pm - +263 77 341 5211: Iam through with the reading ma'am
19/09/23, 2:09 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for Tanaka’s  EWYL journey:

1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound, tanaka?
19/09/23, 2:15 pm - +263 77 341 5211: It sounds good.  Can't wait for  the proclamation to the  day I will be  a successful Edoofian
19/09/23, 2:18 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: For the most part of the EWYL journey, the students would work on three major projects to learn & earn as many scholarship credits as they can and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. You can take today’s time and go through the document and answer these questions for me. 
Will that be okay?
19/09/23, 2:19 pm - +263 77 341 5211: It's okay  ma'am
19/09/23, 2:19 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
19/09/23, 2:19 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Here are the questions
1. Name all three projects.
2. What do you understand from Project 1?
3. What do you understand from Project 2?
4. What do you understand from Project 3?
You can read the document and answer the questions before our session tomorrow. May I now is it clear?
19/09/23, 2:20 pm - +263 77 341 5211: Thanks  I will go through the work
19/09/23, 2:21 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how Tanaka can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-

1. Give your best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss your EWYL sessions without informing your mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share your challenges and the things you’re good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc., and make your mentor trust you fully
I hope we are on the same page?
19/09/23, 2:32 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, it is time to wrap up the session. It was lovely talking to you. Have a wonderful day ahead!

07/12/23, 1:51 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Before we start, I want you to answer the questions that I am sharing below:

Q1. Please mention the name of your school. Is your school connected with Edoofa?
Q2. Please share the messages that you will use when you reach out to the School Heads.
Q3. Name of the Province where your school is located.
07/12/23, 2:04 pm - +263 77 924 8140: Answers 
1. My school is St Anthony's High School and  it is connected with Edoofa
2.Firstly l have to introduce myself to the school Heads then after that lm going to give them a message written.. Greetings to you the school Head, Your school is very lucky because I have chosen it to be one of the schools which will be connected with Edoofa . I hope and trust that you will allow your students to be part of the program 
3. Masvingo Province
07/12/23, 2:07 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: It is good to see that your school is already a part of our family. Now, I believe it would be beneficial for other schools to establish a connection with Edoofa. By doing so, you can ensure that students have access to a wider range of educational opportunities and experiences that extend beyond the boundaries of the local education system. Do you agree?
07/12/23, 2:09 pm - +263 77 924 8140: Yes l agree with you ma'am
07/12/23, 2:10 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, Now our first task is to get the number of the School headmaster. There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to your Headmaster at School with whom you were close and ask him/her for the School Head’s Contact.
Even before that, you can ask your schoolmates peers, or neighbors if they have their School Head’s Contact.
07/12/23, 2:11 pm - +263 77 924 8140: Noted ma'am
07/12/23, 2:14 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Once you get the headmaster’s number, it is time for us to reach out to the school head in a professional manner. With poor communication, it's easy for messages to get misunderstood. By mastering the professional touch, the potential for misunderstandings occurring can be minimized.

The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career. So are you ready?
07/12/23, 2:16 pm - +263 77 924 8140: Yes I am ready ma'am
07/12/23, 2:18 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: _So, This is what the First message should look like_

I hope this message finds you well. Allow me to introduce myself as a student of your esteemed institution. I am writing to share some exciting news.
I have been honored with the privilege of being selected for the Edoofa scholarship program. Through this incredible opportunity, I have been granted the chance to pursue my higher education in India, and what makes it even more remarkable is that this scholarship covers 50-100% of my educational expenses.
I would greatly appreciate the chance to discuss this further with you. Could you please let me know when it would be convenient for you to connect via WhatsApp?
07/12/23, 2:20 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, it's time to conclude our session. I hope you enjoyed our conversation.

Now, I will meet you tomorrow at 1:30 pm for another wonderful session. Make sure you come on time.

08/12/23, 2:31 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: When the school’s per-term fees are less than $100, we do not get a school call done by Edoofa's Program Director.
08/12/23, 2:31 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: The reason behind this is that there is very much doubt that the students from this school will or will not be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education.
So in such a case, we insist that students form a WhatsApp where they add me, Mr. Jyotishman, Ms. Deepali, Mr. Abhinav, and the Headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact from that school. After forming the group they:
