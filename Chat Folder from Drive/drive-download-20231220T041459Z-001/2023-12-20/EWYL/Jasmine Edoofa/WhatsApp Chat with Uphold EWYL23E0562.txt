As you step into the weekend, seize this opportunity to recharge and empower yourself for the week ahead. Your commitment to preparation and growth will set the tone for the coming days.
Happy Weekend!

29/08/23, 9:34 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Morning, 
I want to share with you a beautiful aspect of Indian culture – *the festival of Rakhi.* The central theme of Rakhi is the unbreakable bond between brothers and sisters. On this day, sisters tie a colorful thread (the rakhi) around their brothers' wrists as a symbol of their love, protection, and lifelong commitment to each other. In return, brothers shower their sisters with gifts and a promise to stand by them through thick and thin.
29/08/23, 9:36 am - Jasmine Edoofa: As a result, there will be *no sessions tomorrow*, allowing me to fully engage in this special occasion with my loved ones. I encourage you all to take this time to learn more about Rakhi, its traditions, and the values it promotes.
I look forward to our continued journey of cultural exploration and learning together.

Wishing you all joy, unity, and growth ☺️
29/08/23, 12:50 pm - +263 78 231 8634: Thank you

I encountered power cuts in my vicinity
01/09/23, 2:59 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for the inconvenience caused, but I must request your understanding for today. We have scheduled visits to several universities in the coming days, and an unexpected urgent meeting has arisen that requires my immediate attention. I assure you that we will make up for the missed session during our next meeting, which is scheduled for *Monday at 8:30 a.m.*

Until then, please take good care, and I hope you have a wonderful weekend ahead.

I am delighted to share some exciting news with you. Tomorrow, we embark on a journey to visit our esteemed universities for the orientation event, a momentous occasion that fills me with great anticipation. 

As we prepare for this enriching experience, *I want to inform you that our regular sessions for the next two days will be temporarily suspended.* However, fret not; we shall resume our engaging discussions and learning on *_Thursday, the 7th of September, 2023._*
During our visit, I promise to capture moments to share with you through pictures and updates. Until then, have a splendid and productive time, dear student!
04/09/23, 2:32 pm - +263 78 231 8634: It’s alright Ma’am 
Thank you
08/09/23, 8:29 am - Jasmine Edoofa: *Good morning*
I hope this message finds you in high spirits. I want to begin by sharing my excitement about the recent orientation program we organised. Meeting all the students in person was a truly delightful experience. It's been a journey of 7-8 months of staying in touch, and finally having the opportunity to meet face-to-face added a whole new dimension to our connection.
_*I can't express how much I'm looking forward to the day when we can meet in person as well. That moment will surely be something special.*_

Now, let's seize the day and dive into our session. Are you all ready?

How are you doing? It has been quite a while since we have had a proper detailed conversation. I am bothered that you will be left behind from the rest of the students so if you are facing any challenges then I would really appreciate it if you come to me and let me know. 

I am here to help you and take out the solution in the best way possible. So, what is actually stopping you from taking one hour in a day out for your sessions? Please feel free to discuss them with me.
17/09/23, 3:27 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: *_Good Afternoon,_*  @263775889777 @263782318634

17/09/23, 3:43 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Please go through this message
17/09/23, 3:45 pm - +263 78 231 8634: Ok then 
My name is Uphold Munashe Chiodza, a guy to be promptly aged 20 in October. I’m born of Charles Chiodza and Mercy Dokora who are communal farmers in Zimbabwe with no proffesion in that field. My parents indeed managed to get me to school from ordinary to advanced level yet they are no longer affording to get me to tertiary level because fees in tertiary level are quite expensive.However, this accelerated me to look for scholarship schemes like Edoofa to help me meet my goals.
I’ve always dreamed of being a doctor hence I want to stretch my dream in MBBS up to when I’m indescribable to the world at large and moreover, I would like to work hard until I implement something in my name into that field 
More so, I’m a indulgent and hardworking student upon my career
In accord to Ellis Robins school, they were charging USD$90 per term in which I was there during the course from 2022 to 2023. I did sciences that are Pure mathematics,Physics and Chemistry to be specific where I scooped grades that are A , D and D respectively 
Furthermore, I have managed to be a leader at Ellis Robins school in which I was sworn to be a kind prefect( to confirm from S.Muradzikwa the Head at Ellis Robins-0774 441 518/Email:admin@ellisrobins.ac.zw)
As per my ordinary level course , I took the course at Domboramwari High in Epworth in which I scooped 5A’s and 5B’s in sciences, commercials and arts (to confirm from RUBHABHA M (Ms.) The School Head -0776907679)
I do wish to study Medicine that is MBBS as already stated above until renowned to the world due to implementation of great notions in this specific field at large 
More so, I do also go for basketball, chess and rugby as my hobbies if you can confirm this from Ellis Robins school with the contact provided above 
Apart from the above, my family is constituted of four boys and I being the first born , the second born named Craig Chiodza is facing challenges -since my parents are not affording at all
In addition, my parents do not have any qualifications with them in which as I retrospect my father dropped school when he was in grade 9 (my apology in saying this Dad).However, they are communal farmers in the rural areas in Mt Darwin.
17/09/23, 3:46 pm - +263 78 231 8634: So indeed the earn while you learn program will provide me with a chance to study abroad in India
17/09/23, 3:46 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Uphold, did you wrote it just now?
17/09/23, 3:48 pm - +263 78 231 8634: I had the same question with my counselor before
17/09/23, 3:48 pm - +263 78 231 8634: So this  from mystatement of purpose
17/09/23, 3:49 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Okay, Your dedication and passion for your future are truly remarkable, Uphold. I'm excited to be a part of your journey and help you turn your dreams into reality.
17/09/23, 3:50 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: So, you are already aware of the EWYL Program. If so, can you provide me with some information about it?
So that I can ensure that we both are on the same page.

I hope you are doing well. I wanted to reach out to you regarding an important matter related to Uphold, where I have been serving as a mentor since August 24th.  Unfortunately, we haven't even initiated discussions about the projects yet. Moreover, there have been instances where Uphold has missed several sessions.
19/09/23, 8:10 am - Jasmine Edoofa: I truly believe in Uphold's potential, and I am committed to providing guidance and support. *However, I would like to kindly request your involvement and cooperation as well*. I believe that your input and encouragement would greatly benefit Uphold's progress and development. I expect acknowledgement and cooperation.
