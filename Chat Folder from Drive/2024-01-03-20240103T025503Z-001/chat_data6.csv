202 - 02 Jan 2024 10:56AM - Garima Edoofa: The Earn While You Learn Program or the *EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program*. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

203 - 02 Jan 2024 10:56AM - Garima Edoofa: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.  The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
204 - 02 Jan 2024 10:57AM - +263 71 523 9347: Ok
205 - 02 Jan 2024 11:17AM - Garima Edoofa: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.   1. *Projects with Brands and Companies*: -  The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:  -Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4DAP24ZuY4&authuser=0 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0  -Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
206 - 02 Jan 2024 11:18AM - Garima Edoofa: 2. *Recruitment Partners*: -  Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:- -Nigenuis -Skooqs -Success Magazine -TIA Organics
207 - 02 Jan 2024 11:18AM - Garima Edoofa: 3. *Webinars*: -  We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: - Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade. How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi How to be industry ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje Decoding the science of personal branding by Mr, Simon Maingi

214 - 02 Jan 2024 11:18AM - Garima Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.  These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases.  What are your views on the same? Do you think this will be benefiting you?
215 - 02 Jan 2024 11:18AM - +263 71 523 9347: Yes
216 - 02 Jan 2024 12:06PM - Garima Edoofa: That is great to know, so now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food, and accommodation*, which means for the monthly family cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.  _*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
217 - 02 Jan 2024 12:06PM - Garima Edoofa: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

178 - 02 Jan 2024 11:38AM - +263 77 278 9814: She is at work but she promised to send a voice note as soon as she gets off today
179 - 02 Jan 2024 11:42AM - Garima Edoofa: Alright Jerome.
180 - 02 Jan 2024 11:43AM - Garima Edoofa: Alright Jerome, basically once we complete your counseling session I would give you time to properly discuss about your entire application once again with your family members so that they too could have much better clarity regarding the same. Meanwhile, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.  Are you ready?
181 - 02 Jan 2024 11:48AM - +263 77 278 9814: Yes I am
182 - 02 Jan 2024 12:42PM - Garima Edoofa: Jerome as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.  *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
183 - 02 Jan 2024 12:52PM - +263 77 278 9814: So are they any chances that I can be denied
184 - 02 Jan 2024 12:53PM - Garima Edoofa: Jerome I would like you to answer this question that I just asked you?
185 - 02 Jan 2024 01:03PM - +263 77 278 9814: Oky sorry … let’s say a student applies I 5 universities at the cost of 450 he will be paying 2250 usd  But if the same student pays 300 per application he will only use 1500
186 - 02 Jan 2024 01:05PM - Garima Edoofa: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
190 - 02 Jan 2024 01:06PM - Garima Edoofa: We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education.  Don’t you think so?
191 - 02 Jan 2024 01:16PM - +263 77 278 9814: I really appreciate the program
192 - 02 Jan 2024 01:18PM - +263 77 278 9814: That’s good
193 - 02 Jan 2024 01:18PM - +263 77 278 9814: So is this done on the internet?
194 - 02 Jan 2024 01:18PM - +263 77 278 9814: Yaa and it also sounds safe
195 - 02 Jan 2024 01:36PM - Garima Edoofa: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
196 - 02 Jan 2024 01:36PM - Garima Edoofa: Jerome basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process.  *Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation  If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.  *Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).  *Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents.  *The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
197 - 02 Jan 2024 01:37PM - Garima Edoofa: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
198 - 02 Jan 2024 01:39PM - +263 77 278 9814: Oky that’s sounds fantastic

10 - 02 Jan 2024 01:51PM - Garima Edoofa: You see, Edoofa Scholarship Program is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4000 students from different African countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!
11 - 02 Jan 2024 01:51PM - Garima Edoofa: EDOOFA has praised the new government for its strong commitment and positive reforms in the education sector.  The elimination of school fees, increase in the number of teachers, and keeping vulnerable learners, especially adolescent girls, in school are some of the notable positive reforms.  EDOOFA is deeply honored to support the government in its endeavor to transform the education sector to achieve Sustainable Development which seeks to ensure inclusive and equitable quality education between now and 2030.  After our successful visit to Zambia and meetings at the Ministries, we have already begun conducting Scholarship Tests and Counseling Sessions at eminent schools in Zambia.  Also, Edoofa is looking for deserving candidates who are meritorious and seek affordable education in the world’s second-largest higher education space.  Our strong partnerships with educational institutions like Penmal Connect Ltd., and Trident College from Zambia have paved the way for numerous success stories along with various institutions like Kamulanga High, Canisius Secondary, National Hillcrest, Matero Boys Secondary, etc! We are also connected with the likes of Njase, Ndola Girls, Fatima Secondary, Torbit, and Zambezi Boarding among many others to offer, build and extend the opportunity of the Edoofa Scholarship Program to more and more deserving students across Zambia.

206 - 02 Jan 2024 11:14AM - Garima Edoofa: Alright Melisa, basically once we complete your counseling session I would give you time to properly discuss about your entire application once again with your family members so that they too could have much better clarity regarding the same. Meanwhile, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.  Are you ready?
207 - 02 Jan 2024 12:05PM - +263 77 170 1656: Yes l am
208 - 02 Jan 2024 12:07PM - Garima Edoofa: Melisa as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.  *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
209 - 02 Jan 2024 12:09PM - +263 77 170 1656: About 2250
210 - 02 Jan 2024 12:09PM - Garima Edoofa: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.",No,Yes

A few key skills that are of paramount importance in the field of law are: *Good Written Communication*– Writing forms a major part of the work in in the legal profession. The written communication involves letters, documents, notices, and so on. The documents must be grammatically correct and error free. This requires a good level of English proficiency. *Good Verbal Communication*– A lot depends on how well the legal professional can express his or her case, arguments and generally converse with clients and authorities. Good verbal communication ensures good expression and understanding which are crucial for a successful career in law. *Good Time Management*– In the legal profession, time management is very crucial. The art of delegating tasks, working within deadlines, and prioritizing tasks to achieve success is very essential. *A great degree of self-confidence*– This profession needs a high degree of self-confidence to win the clients’ trust. A strong belief in yourself will go a long way in winning arguments and cases. *An analytical mind and good research skills*– A case with proper research and well-reasoned out and evaluated argument stands a very high chance of success. *High EQ (Emotional Quotient)*– Individuals in the legal profession, especially lawyers, must learn to be empathetic. *Tech Savvy*– In the rapidly developing and evolving technological world, they must be abreast of the latest technology to understand and use it, as and when needed. They need to use technology to their advantage to improve their efficiency and chances of success. *Good Commercial awareness*– This is not only restricted to being aware of the current trends and technology, prevalent in the world of business and law, but also being aware of the developments in the world of business and law, both nationally and globally. *A high degree of patience*– This is a much needed skill, since you deal with different types of people and some cases and procedures stretch over a period of time which need a lot of patience and careful handling. *Team player skills*– Since a legal professional will deal with a lot of people therefore to be effective they need to bond with people. The art of getting work done and obtaining information though networking and working with people helps in attaining the objectives.

If a person suddenly encounters any terrible danger, the change of nature one undergoes is equally great. Sometimes fear numbs our senses. Like animals, one stands still, powerless to move a step in fright or to lift a hand in defense of our lives, and sometimes one is seized with panic, and again, act more like the inferior animals than rational beings. On the other hand, frequently in cases of sudden extreme peril, which cannot be escaped by flight, and must be instantly faced, even the most timid men at once as if by miracle, become possessed of the necessary courage, sharp quick apprehension and swift decision. This is a miracle very common in nature. Man and the inferior animals alike, when confronted with almost certain death ‘ gather resolution from despair’ but there can really be no trace of so debilitating a feeling in the person fighting, or prepare d to fight for dear life. At such times the mind is clearer than it has ever been; the nerves are steel, there is nothing felt but a wonderful strength and daring. Looking back at certain perilous moments in my own life, I remember them with a kind of joy, not that there was any joyful excitement then, but because they broadened my horizon, lifted me for a time above myself.  1. The title that best suits the passage would be: a) The Change of Nature b) The Will to Fight c) Courage and Panic d) The Miracle of Confronting Danger  2.A man may react to sudden danger in three different ways . What are they? a) He may be paralyzed with fear, run away or fight. b) He may flee in panic, or fight back or stand still. c) He may be paralyzed with fear, or seized with panic, or as if by miracle, become possessed of the necessary courage, and face the danger. d) He may be paralyzed with fear, seized with panic or act like an inferior animal.  3.What is the meaning of the word debilitating ? a) enfeeble b) thriving c) strengthen d) debase  4. Explain the phrase ‘gather resolution from danger’. a) Find peace in times of difficulty. b) To remain calm and not to lose hope. c) A state of utter hopelessness makes one determined to face the difficulty. d) To be enthusiastic and brave the odds.  5. The author feels happy in the recollection of dangers faced and overcome because a) He felt elated as he was alive. b) They added a new perspective and lifted him above himself for a time. c) They brought him a new experience. d) These experiences boosted his confidence.

Whey to Go Greek yogurt—a strained form of cultured yogurt—has grown enormously in popularity in the United States since it was first introduced in the country in the late 1980s. From 2011 to 2012 alone, sales of Greek yogurt in the US increased by 50 percent. The resulting increase in Greek yogurt production has forced those involved in the business to address the detrimental effects that the yogurt-making process may be having on the environment.

D 11.A 12.B 13.C 14.B 15.A 16.B  SECTION 5  Life in Rwanda, 16 years after the genocide, reflects a complex narrative of resilience, reconciliation, and reconstruction. The aftermath of the 1994 genocide left an indelible mark on the nation, its people, and the global conscience. The subsequent years have witnessed remarkable transformations, challenging perceptions of the country and inspiring hope for a better future.  Rwanda's journey from the depths of despair to its present state is a testament to the strength of its people and visionary leadership. The genocide, which claimed nearly a million lives in just 100 days, shattered the social fabric of the nation. Families were torn apart, communities devastated, and trust obliterated. However, the post-genocide era has been defined by a collective commitment to healing and rebuilding.  One of the most striking aspects of life in Rwanda today is the emphasis on unity and reconciliation. The government, under the leadership of President Paul Kagame, has implemented policies that prioritize national unity over ethnic divisions. The divisive ethnic identities of Hutu, Tutsi, and Twa have been downplayed in favor of a more inclusive Rwandan identity. This deliberate effort to foster unity has played a crucial role in rebuilding trust among the population.  The Gacaca courts, a community-based justice system, were established to address the overwhelming number of genocide-related cases. This innovative approach sought not only to bring perpetrators to justice but also to promote truth-telling and reconciliation. While the Gacaca courts faced challenges and criticisms, they represented a unique attempt to navigate the complexities of justice and reconciliation in the aftermath of such a traumatic event.  Economically, Rwanda has experienced significant growth and development. The government has implemented policies to attract foreign investment, promote entrepreneurship, and diversify the economy. The capital, Kigali, has transformed into a hub of innovation and technology, earning the nickname ""the Singapore of Africa."" Infrastructure development, including the construction of roads and the expansion of the Kigali International Airport, has further facilitated economic progress.  Education has been a focal point for the government, recognizing the role it plays in shaping the future of the nation. Efforts to improve access to education and promote inclusivity have resulted in increased enrollment and literacy rates. The emphasis on education also extends to the remembrance and understanding of the genocide, ensuring that younger generations are aware of their history.  Despite these positive changes, challenges persist. The psychological scars of the genocide run deep, and the process of reconciliation is ongoing. Many survivors and perpetrators continue to grapple with the trauma, and the need for mental health support remains a critical aspect of the healing process. Additionally, issues of justice, accountability, and the reintegration of former combatants into society pose ongoing challenges.  In conclusion, life in Rwanda 16 years after the genocide reflects a nation's determined effort to rise from the ashes of tragedy. The emphasis on unity, reconciliation, and economic development has paved the way for a more hopeful future. However, the journey is far from over, and Rwanda continues to navigate the complexities of post-genocide recovery. The story of Rwanda serves as a reminder of the human capacity for resilience and transformation, offering lessons for the global community on the possibilities of healing and rebuilding even in the face of unimaginable adversity.  SECTION 6  Journey of Zambia's President  In the heart of Southern Africa, a nation emerged from the shadows of adversity, guided by the visionary leadership of Zambia's President. His journey from a grassroots activist to the highest office in the land is an inspirational narrative that has revitalized the spirit of the Zambian people.  Born into humble beginnings, the president's early life mirrored the challenges faced by many in his nation. However, his insatiable thirst for knowledge became the compass guiding him through the maze of hardships. With a scholarship in hand, he pursued higher education, recognizing that education was not just a personal pursuit but a key to unlocking the potential of an entire nation.  As a young activist, he stood on the frontlines, advocating for social justice and economic empowerment. His unwavering commitment to the welfare of the people earned him the trust of communities grappling with poverty and inequality. It was this grassroots connection that would later define his presidency.  Assuming office during a period of economic uncertainty, the president faced a daunting task. Undeterred, he embarked on a mission to transform Zambia into a beacon of progress and inclusivity. His economic policies aimed at fostering growth while ensuring that the benefits reached even the remotest corners of the country.  One of the president's hallmark achievements was a comprehensive healthcare reform, recognizing that a healthy nation is a productive nation. Under his leadership, healthcare infrastructure saw unprecedented development, and initiatives were launched to address endemic diseases. The president's commitment to the well-being of every Zambian became a rallying cry for a healthier and more resilient nation.  In the realm of education, the president championed initiatives to increase access and improve the quality of learning. Recognizing that education is the cornerstone of progress, he implemented policies that encouraged innovation, technology adoption, and global collaboration. Schools became hubs of inspiration, nurturing the next generation of leaders and visionaries.  Yet, perhaps the most transformative aspect of the president's tenure was his dedication to fostering unity and inclusivity. He recognized the strength in diversity and tirelessly worked to bridge gaps, ensuring that every citizen, regardless of background, had a stake in Zambia's journey toward prosperity.  As the nation navigated global challenges, the president stood tall, a symbol of resilience and forward-thinking leadership. His ability to steer Zambia through turbulent waters, coupled with a commitment to ethical governance, earned him not just respect within the nation but admiration on the international stage.  The story of Zambia's president is a testament to the belief that transformative leadership is born from a deep understanding of the people's needs and an unwavering commitment to a shared vision. His journey inspires not just Zambians but serves as a beacon of hope for nations seeking progress, unity, and a brighter future under the guidance of visionary leadership.  This story inspires me greatly and makes me to believe that where there's a will, they'll always be a way.

24 - 02 Jan 2024 12:47PM - Gurvinder: Okay so Chiedza, as we start your counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship.  In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics.  *1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation.  *2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.  Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
25 - 02 Jan 2024 12:51PM - +263 77 488 4699: Yes I do have what it takes
26 - 02 Jan 2024 01:09PM - Gurvinder: Now Chiedza, I would like to know you better as a student.

If a person suddenly encounters any terrible danger, the change of nature one undergoes is equally great. Sometimes fear numbs our senses. Like animals, one stands still, powerless to move a step in fright or to lift a hand in defense of our lives, and sometimes one is seized with panic, and again, act more like the inferior animals than rational beings. On the other hand, frequently in cases of sudden extreme peril, which cannot be escaped by flight, and must be instantly faced, even the most timid men at once as if by miracle, become possessed of the necessary courage, sharp quick apprehension and swift decision. This is a miracle very common in nature. Man and the inferior animals alike, when confronted with almost certain death ‘ gather resolution from despair’ but there can really be no trace of so debilitating a feeling in the person fighting, or prepare d to fight for dear life. At such times the mind is clearer than it has ever been; the nerves are steel, there is nothing felt but a wonderful strength and daring. Looking back at certain perilous moments in my own life, I remember them with a kind of joy, not that there was any joyful excitement then, but because they broadened my horizon, lifted me for a time above myself.  1. The title that best suits the passage would be: a) The Change of Nature b) The Will to Fight c) Courage and Panic d) The Miracle of Confronting Danger  2.A man may react to sudden danger in three different ways . What are they? a) He may be paralyzed with fear, run away or fight. b) He may flee in panic, or fight back or stand still. c) He may be paralyzed with fear, or seized with panic, or as if by miracle, become possessed of the necessary courage, and face the danger. d) He may be paralyzed with fear, seized with panic or act like an inferior animal.  3.What is the meaning of the word debilitating ? a) enfeeble b) thriving c) strengthen d) debase  4. Explain the phrase ‘gather resolution from danger’. a) Find peace in times of difficulty. b) To remain calm and not to lose hope. c) A state of utter hopelessness makes one determined to face the difficulty. d) To be enthusiastic and brave the odds.  5. The author feels happy in the recollection of dangers faced and overcome because a) He felt elated as he was alive. b) They added a new perspective and lifted him above himself for a time. c) They brought him a new experience. d) These experiences boosted his confidence.  SECTION 3 LANGUAGE TEST  Each passage below is accompanied by a number of questions. For some questions, you will consider how the passage might be revised to improve the expression of ideas. For other questions, you will consider how the passage might be edited to correct errors in sentence structure, usage, or punctuation. A passage or a question may be accompanied by one or more graphics (such as a table or graph) that you will consider as you make revising and editing decisions. Some questions will direct you to an underlined portion of a passage. Other questions will direct you to a location in a passage or ask you to think about the passage as a whole. After reading each passage, choose the answer to each question that most effectively improves the quality of writing in the passage or that makes the passage conform to the conventions of standard written English. Many questions include a “NO CHANGE” option. Choose that option if you think the best choice is to leave the relevant portion of the passage as it is.

Given these solutions as well as the many health benefits of the food, the advantages of Greek yogurt Q5. outdo the potential drawbacks of its production. Sentence [1] The main environmental problem caused by the production of Greek yogurt is the creation of acid whey as a by-product. Sentence [2] Because it requires up to four times more milk to make than conventional yogurt does, Greek yogurt produces larger amounts of acid whey, which is difficult to dispose of. Sentence [3] To address the problem of disposal, farmers have found a number of uses for acid whey. Sentence[4] They can add it to livestock feed as a protein Q.6. supplement and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt. Sentence[5] If it is improperly introduced into the environment, acid-whey runoff Q.7. can pollute waterways, depleting the oxygen content of streams and rivers as it decomposes. Sentence [6] Yogurt manufacturers, food Q.8. scientists; and government officials are also working together to develop additional solutions for reusing whey.  6. outdo  D) outweigh  7.can pollute waterways A) NO CHANGE   8.scientists; and  C) scientists, and  9.To make this paragraph most logical, Sentence 5 should be placed C) after sentence 2.

B) 2       SECTION 5 ESSAY WRITING Write a short essay in about 500 words  TOPIC: What is life in Rwanda like 16 years after the genocide there?  16 years following the Rwandan genocide, survivors and their families continue to present with considerable rates of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and substantial depressive and anxiety symptoms.   A study undertaken clearly showed that, genocide survivors showed high rates of mental health and psychosocial problems due to the inconceivable, dehumanized brutality that the majority of them had been exposed or witnessed. Entire family systems as well as the general social fabric that formerly provided support were destroyed due to losses of family members and growing mistrust and fear following the genocide. A great majority of the survivors were female and woman-headed households proved to be especially vulnerable, suffering from the effects of economic deprivation, which included a lack of food, housing and money for the education of their children. Apart from general population samples, studies analyzing the mental health situation in Rwanda following the genocide have mainly focused on groups of widows and orphans or children living in child-headed households. An elevated level of depressive and anxious symptoms as well as PTSD was found in each of these groups.  On the other hand, little to nothing is known about the mental health situation of former prisoners in Rwanda, many of which spent several years in refugee camps. It is assumed that former prisoners that is, accused perpetrators and their respective families also present mental health problems, due to their participation in or to the exposure to violence, genocide and their refugee status. A  comparison of the physical and mental healthof the survivorsand the prisonersis necessary, as prisoners constitute important stakeholders within the post-conflict Rwandansociety and assumingly present with different mentalhealth and socioeconomic profiles. This also assumed that a neutral, unaffected group would be near impossible to find owing to the pervasive effects of violence on the Rwandan population as a whole. As the primary targets of genocidal acts were men and boys, genocide survivors proved to be mainly women, whereas genocide-related crimes were mainly committed by men hence a gender imbalance is therefore assumed in the present population. A further hypothesis points out that families of genocide survivors had been exposed to more traumatic events and that they were more affected in terms of mental and physical health.  A current study revealed data that showed  a strong association betweenhealth problems and psychosocial factors such as socialintegration. A high level of PTSD in the group of formerprisoners, and thus the likely genocide perpetrators thatdemonstrated that psychological suffering affected thepopulation at large, although the nature of traumaticstressors may have varied. By challenging the question ofwho “owns” trauma discourses in a post-conflict societysuch as Rwanda, mental health services should take theneeds of the entire population into consideration when offering care. An idea that is still not mainstream in Rwanda.  Overally, the descendants of genocide survivors showed a higher risk for mental health problems than descendants of former prisoners. A high trauma load as well as missing family integration and support characterizes their specific vulnerable situation. Interventions and initiatives that stimulate reconciliation processes between future generations.                SECTION 6 PERSONALITY TEST ""My Inspirational Story""   Growing up in a child-headed family, Silvester Sinclare had a tough upbringing in a deserted society where no relatives offered help to him and his older brother. His brother could not afford to go to school so he sacrifice to work for his brother to attend school.  With all the troubles and suffering he experienced through his life, he had a burning desire to succeed in the near future life so that he could take care of his brother. Being a kind-hearted person, Silvester also had the passion to work and develop the deserted society he grew up in. In studying he aimed for the farthest destinations in this infinite universe so that if he missed atleast he will shine brightly among the stars and be an example to the upcoming future generations. During his studies he believed that there is nothing known as luck, rather it is just a coincidence of events in a timeline as a result of hardwork. In several occasions he had to skip school and help his brother in working to get the school fees., but however this did not disturb his education as the results always said it loud and clear. He won several trophies in coming up as one of the best students of all times at the school.  When he completed his advanced level, he came up with a bright future that proved many people of the community that he was guaranteed for a brighter future than one which he grew up in. The problem that rose was that his brother could not pay the required amounts of fees for his tertiary education, but however,  a coincidence of events occurred that lifted the pressure from his brothers shoulders as he had passed his advanced level with flying colors. Silvester received an apprenticeship from the government which allowed him to study the desired program at tertiary education at any school that was best suited his interests. Silvester chose to pursue a career in chartered accountanting at tertiary level and he came out as the best student from the overall assessment made. A day after his graduation ceremony where he got a degree in chartered accountancy and business management, several companies were already offering work to Silvester with different guarantees covering housing, food and transport and with good payments.  After the completion of his goals,Silvester shone brightly among the stars a light the path of the young people in studying. He took care of his brother and  begun rebuilding the broken and deserted community and made sure that the lives of the community members prospered. His community honoured him for his great work and set motto which read; 'when everything seems lost, only hope remains', for there is light at the end of every dark tunnel.

93 - 02 Jan 2024 10:00AM - Gurvinder: So now moving ahead by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India?
94 - 02 Jan 2024 10:17AM - +263 78 833 5723: No
95 - 02 Jan 2024 10:22AM - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
96 - 02 Jan 2024 10:22AM - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
97 - 02 Jan 2024 10:22AM - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*

99 - 02 Jan 2024 10:22AM - Gurvinder: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:  *1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)* *2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)* *3. Food* *4. Accommodation*  *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

274 - 02 Jan 2024 01:08PM - Gurvinder: @263713206464, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.  It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.  The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.  Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
275 - 02 Jan 2024 01:08PM - Gurvinder: If I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.  _*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
276 - 02 Jan 2024 01:18PM - +263 71 320 6464: Understood

Equipped with the program's rigorous training and global network, I'd be spearheading a tech startup specializing in computer science tackling Zimbabwe's challenges head-on. Imagine creating one of the best computer softwares or a computer networking system that could be used all around the globe that's the impact I strive for. Through ethical leadership and community engagement, I aim to inspire a generation of Zimbabwean innovators, building a vibrant ecosystem where talent thrives and dreams take flight. My success will be measured not just by personal growth, but by the positive ripple effect it creates across Zimbabwe, paving the way for a brighter, more prosperous future. Most of all I would inspire my fellow youth of Zimbabwe and show them that we could live the life of our dreams if we work for our dreams to come to come true.

Are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way inorder to transform your career dear?

81 - 02 Jan 2024 02:28PM - Gurvinder: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
82 - 02 Jan 2024 02:51PM - +263 78 073 3676: One of the major reasons I would like to study abroad if for me to study abroad is expanding horizons immersing myself in a new culture can help me break down preconceived notions and offer fresh perspectives on the world and myself. Being away from home encourages self-reliance, resourcefulness, and problem-solving skills. And that will help me become an independent being without much help and support from my parents and family. I will also be able to access specialized programs, unique courses, or world-renowned universities not available in my home country. Studying abroad will help me connect with individuals abroad which can later open doors to future career opportunities for me. Studying abroad will enhance my employability by demonstrating adaptability, intercultural competence, and global awareness. Employers in my country increasingly value international experience and its associated skills so it will be an advantage for me.
83 - 02 Jan 2024 03:03PM - Gurvinder: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.  In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?",No,Yes

Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students.  Don’t you think so?

237 - 02 Jan 2024 10:00AM - Gurvinder: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
238 - 02 Jan 2024 10:01AM - Gurvinder: Precious basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process.  *Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation  If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.  *Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).  *Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents.  *The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
239 - 02 Jan 2024 10:01AM - Gurvinder: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.

176 - 02 Jan 2024 09:57AM - Gurvinder: I am delighted to hear that Munashe, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.  _*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_

22 - 02 Jan 2024 11:52AM - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*  One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
23 - 02 Jan 2024 11:52AM - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
24 - 02 Jan 2024 11:52AM - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
25 - 02 Jan 2024 11:52AM - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?

222 - 02 Jan 2024 10:00AM - Gurvinder: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students.  Don’t you think so?
223 - 02 Jan 2024 10:08AM - +263 77 402 0424: Yes l do

225 - 02 Jan 2024 10:14AM - Gurvinder: Please, that means Statement of Purpose.
226 - 02 Jan 2024 10:16AM - +263 77 402 0424: Thank you
226 - 02 Jan 2024 10:16AM - +263 77 402 0424: Thank you
227 - 02 Jan 2024 10:19AM - Gurvinder: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
228 - 02 Jan 2024 10:20AM - Gurvinder: Mrs Ruzvidzo basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process.  *Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation  If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.  *Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).  *Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents.  *The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
229 - 02 Jan 2024 10:20AM - Gurvinder: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
230 - 02 Jan 2024 11:09AM - +263 77 402 0424: Thank you well understood
231 - 02 Jan 2024 11:57AM - Gurvinder: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.  Are you familiar with the Edoofa Cycle?
232 - 02 Jan 2024 12:09PM - +263 77 402 0424: Yes l am
233 - 02 Jan 2024 12:14PM - Gurvinder: Alright Mrs Ruzvidzo, as you can see, we are currently at Step 1. After this step, you will proceed to Step 2. If you successfully pass Step 2, you will receive your Acceptance Letter from the Edoofa Academic Board in Step 3. After that, as shown in the image above, the completion of your Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4.  Upon completing your formalities, in Step 5: we will initiate your Edoofa Admission Process and your Earn While You Learn Program. We will assign your complete application to our Admission Officers and the Head Coach of the Earn While You Learn Program.  The Admission Officers will be responsible for assisting you with all the required admission documentation that we discussed earlier, including the Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendation, and the completion of applications in all of Edoofa’s Associated Universities, etc.  The Head Coach will be responsible for assigning your application to the Earn While You Learn Program Mentor, who will then evaluate your candidature and assist with projects and assignments throughout your journey with the Edoofa Program.
234 - 02 Jan 2024 12:14PM - Gurvinder: As an organization that has positively impacted the lives of tens of thousands of African students, we understand that over 97% of parents face financial challenges when planning for their child’s tertiary education. In fact, it is one of the most prominent fears because of which there are parents who despite understanding the kind of growth their child would get through international education, still opt for their children to study in their home country.  Now in our quest to overcome this challenge, I would like to inform you that in Stage 5, while our Admission officers assist with all the necessary admission-related documentation, Edoofa’s Financial Planning team will connect with your parents to help them plan finances for your higher education.  Since in the majority of African nations inflation is a real challenge, keeping in mind that the cost of living in your home country increases atleast by 20% year on year, Financial Planning officers will be responsible for helping your parents plan for your tertiary education in a way that ensures they are not burdened financially throughout your education. Financial planning would include the following aspects:- *Budgeting for your higher education, as per your parent's affordability.* *Supporting your parents in building your tertiary education fund.*
235 - 02 Jan 2024 12:14PM - Gurvinder: I hope you now have an in-depth understanding of what happens in Stage 5 of your Edoofa Cycle?

Parent participation is mandatory in this session, failure to attend would result in the cancellation of the application.

60 - 02 Jan 2024 02:27PM - Gurvinder: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.
61 - 02 Jan 2024 02:27PM - Gurvinder: Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.

168 - 29 Dec 2023 03:52PM - Gurvinder: In simple words Tsitsi what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well.  However as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her counselling, eligibility check stage and is thorough throughout the evaluation, then they surely are rewarded with higher quantum of scholarship after which the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, now this , and even *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

172 - 02 Jan 2024 10:02AM - Gurvinder: So now shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?
173 - 02 Jan 2024 10:04AM - +263 71 450 5336: Yes
174 - 02 Jan 2024 10:12AM - Gurvinder: Tsitsi, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.  It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.  The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.  Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
175 - 02 Jan 2024 10:13AM - +263 71 450 5336: Ok understood
176 - 02 Jan 2024 10:17AM - Gurvinder: The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.  *1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*  The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:  -_*Africa Global Radio*_ - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4DAP24ZuY4&authuser=0 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0  -_*Skooqs*_ - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

220 - 02 Jan 2024 10:41AM - Gurvinder: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.  I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
221 - 02 Jan 2024 10:43AM - +263 71 450 5336: It is
222 - 02 Jan 2024 11:53AM - Gurvinder: Alright Tsitsi, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
223 - 02 Jan 2024 04:02PM - +263 71 450 5336: Yes they're
224 - 02 Jan 2024 04:03PM - Gurvinder: Okay so may I know if you have discussed international education plans with them in depth?
225 - 02 Jan 2024 04:03PM - +263 71 450 5336: Yes we have discussed
226 - 02 Jan 2024 04:04PM - Gurvinder: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.  Are you ready?
230 - 02 Jan 2024 04:07PM - Gurvinder: Exactly Tsitsi, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
231 - 02 Jan 2024 04:07PM - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
232 - 02 Jan 2024 04:22PM - +263 71 450 5336: Ok l understand
233 - 02 Jan 2024 04:22PM - Gurvinder: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students.  Don’t you think so?
234 - 02 Jan 2024 04:29PM - +263 71 450 5336: It's a great program
235 - 02 Jan 2024 04:52PM - Gurvinder: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
236 - 02 Jan 2024 04:52PM - Gurvinder: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process.  *Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation  If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.  *Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).  *Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents.  *The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.* <This message was edited>
237 - 02 Jan 2024 04:53PM - Gurvinder: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
238 - 02 Jan 2024 05:01PM - +263 71 450 5336: Ok
239 - 02 Jan 2024 05:02PM - Gurvinder: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.  Are you familiar with the Edoofa Cycle?
242 - 02 Jan 2024 05:06PM - Gurvinder: Alright Tsitsi, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.  Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zimbabwe itself.
243 - 02 Jan 2024 05:06PM - Gurvinder: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
244 - 02 Jan 2024 05:22PM - Gurvinder: @263714505336 Are we still connected?
245 - 02 Jan 2024 07:01PM - +263 71 450 5336: Yes l understand
246 - 02 Jan 2024 07:02PM - +263 71 450 5336: Sorry had network problems
247 - 02 Jan 2024 07:35PM - Gurvinder: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of the registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
248 - 02 Jan 2024 07:35PM - Gurvinder: Basically, this registration fee will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August/September 2024 and the remaining in January next year 2025.
249 - 02 Jan 2024 07:35PM - Gurvinder: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
250 - 02 Jan 2024 07:35PM - Gurvinder: So now would you like to ask anything?
251 - 02 Jan 2024 07:45PM - +263 71 450 5336: So you will be the ones to help me obtain a visa",No,Yes

311 - 02 Jan 2024 07:29PM - Harmehak: That's great
312 - 02 Jan 2024 07:29PM - Harmehak: Okay so Atoness meanwhile, can you tell me:-  1. What is the name of the course which you would be studying through the Edoofa Program?  2. Through Edoofa in which country would you be pursuing your higher education?  3. What is the average cost for studies in that country without a scholarship?  4. What is the annual fee you will pay if found eligible for the program (yearly fee after Edoofa Scholarship)?  5. What is the enrollment fee of the Edoofa Program?  6. If you are found eligible for the program in how many days you will have to pay the first part of your enrollment fee?  7. After receiving your offer letter from the University, you will have to pay your registration fee in order to finalize your university selection and reserve your scholarship seat in a particular university, this registration fee would be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same? <This message was edited>

63 - 02 Jan 2024 05:06PM - +263 77 615 7802: I understood that you can provide fully funded scholarship
64 - 02 Jan 2024 06:16PM - Harmehak: Actually you are mistaken over here, let me explain to you that there are two kinds of programs that provide assistance to the students because a lot of times parents and students themselves misunderstand what a Scholarship actually means.  *1. Scholarships* *2. Sponsorships*  Scholarships make education *affordable* for the students by reducing their *Tuition Fees*, now a lot of times parents and students consider that a Domestic Scholarship would be the same as an International Scholarship, but to understand the difference between them, consider yourself applying for an education in your own country with the help of a scholarship. Now after the scholarship when your tuition fee would be reduced, eventually your entire cost of education would be reduced because being a citizen of the country, you wouldn't be required to spend any fees on Accommodation and feeding separately since in that case, students would be staying with their families. However, if I personally plan to study in Zimbabwe with the same scholarship, I would have to incur some costs on Accommodation and Feeding because I am not a Zimbabwean Citizen. So a lot of times parents and students consider International Scholarship and Domestic Scholarship one and the same thing, but in reality, they aren't.  Sponsorships, on the other hand, take care entirely of a student's education, but because Sponsorships are provided by only a few organizations, there are a lot of terms and conditions which a student might need to follow in order to get the sponsorship, the most common term is that a student after completion of the course would have to work for the organization providing the sponsorship for a period of time.

As a single parent, juggling the responsibilities of a small-scale farmer and the mother of two daughters, she has persevered. Her journey with Edoofa is a testament to how dedicated individuals can overcome obstacles. Mrs. Ruth's experience with Edoofa is a testament to the transformative impact our programs can have. She not only managed her family's needs but also seized the opportunity for her daughters to achieve higher education. The support and guidance she received from Edoofa were instrumental in her success. The process was challenging, yet incredibly rewarding. Mrs. Ruth's determination, combined with Edoofa's assistance, has paved the way for a brighter future .

If you are found eligible for the program in how many days you will have to pay the first part of your enrollment fee?  7. After receiving your provisional offer letter from the University, you will have to pay your registration fee in order to finalize your university selection and reserve your scholarship seat in a particular university, this registration fee would be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?

197 - 02 Jan 2024 01:09PM - Harmehak: You see, Trish, Senior Academician Mr. Piyush was in Zimbabwe for about 90 days. He had the privilege of meeting many Zimbabwean students who had applied for the Edoofa Program back in 2018-2019. However, at that time, they didn't proceed because they were enticed by the prospect of earning quick money in the country. This year, when they met him, they shared how difficult things have been for them. Some of them, despite holding reputed degrees from UZ, MSU, and HIT, are working as petrol attendants, while others have started careers as mobile/laptop repair technicians. Some were facing even more challenges, resorting to selling Ecocash, Simcards, or vegetables.  Observing this scenario, Mr. Piyush saw many of them regretting not seizing the opportunity when they had the chance. So, what you are sharing, I can understand that, in reality, things are much more challenging over there.
198 - 02 Jan 2024 01:11PM - +263 78 190 1631: Sure thing
199 - 02 Jan 2024 01:12PM - Harmehak: I am glad you are making efforts for a promising future, Trish.  Now as you know Edoofa Recommends India as a Higher Education destination.  *May I know what is your knowledge or what have you researched about India and Indian Education System which makes you feel that studying in India would help you achieve your dreams?*

234 - 02 Jan 2024 02:53PM - Harmehak: Trish, from his experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,  While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time.  This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year.  Wouldn't you agree to the same?
235 - 02 Jan 2024 02:55PM - +263 78 190 1631: I would..

84 - 02 Jan 2024 01:49PM - Kunal: Thank you for sharing I want to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.  Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it

88 - 02 Jan 2024 12:03PM - +27 67 288 8421: I learnt that Edoofa is education for all even if u miss your admission they also give you another chance to administer n it is there to help youth have working experience doing practices and having bright future.It also gives strength to students to study to any point you may like at an affordable price.Some other countries like China have higher amount of payment for higher education bt Edoofa is offordable . Students also have scholarship credits on the EWYL program which helps them to decrease their fees
89 - 02 Jan 2024 12:05PM - +27 67 288 8421: The Edoofa also takes care of new students from starting to the end making sure they are comfortable to the environment until they know better or they are able to be by themselves

I will be guiding you through the financial aspects of the program.  Will they be able to manage the remaining expenses?

97 - 02 Jan 2024 04:42PM - Pallika Edoofa: Brenda, I understand!!  Please note that it is a one time investment once you are found eligible for the program. Once you qualify and enroll, you'll kickstart the process of earning valuable scholarship credits. These credits, averaging around 50-100$ per month, provide a significant opportunity for you to independently finance your higher education before you embark on your journey to India. It's an investment that pays off in more ways than one.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. will be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by paying the registration fee within a few weeks.
186 - 02 Jan 2024 12:01PM - Pallika Edoofa: This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself and after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).

I hope you are clear with the process.

136 - 02 Jan 2024 10:14AM - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 5:* After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, They will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. will be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by paying the registration fee within a few weeks.
137 - 02 Jan 2024 10:14AM - Pallika Edoofa: This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself and after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).
138 - 02 Jan 2024 10:14AM - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 6:* Once you are done with the registration fee payment, you will be able to apply for the visa.

But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*    Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it",No,Yes

36 - 02 Jan 2024 04:15PM - Pallika Edoofa: *The Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4,000 students from different African countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5,000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
37 - 02 Jan 2024 04:15PM - Pallika Edoofa: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program. We are associated with more than 200 schools in Zimbabwe. Some of the most elite Schools in Zimbabwe example in Harare we are collaborated with St. Dominic’s Chishawasha, Dominican Convent, Christ Ministries, and many others. In Manicaland, we have a total of 18 Schools to name a few St. David’s Girls Bonda, Hartzell High, First Class, First Choice, and so on.  Chipinge we have Chibuwe High School, You would be happy to know that the DEOs of Mutare and Chipinge have their kids under the Edoofa Scholarship. Masvingo has 24 Schools that collaborated with over 300 students from some of the best schools example Pamushana, St. Antony’s, Reformed Church Gutu, Zaka High, and many others. The program is also appreciated by the Education Inspector of Bikita Madam Makomeke. We have more than 500 students from Mashonaland (West, Central, and East) Province, Midlands Province.  Last but not least we also have Schools from Bulawayo and Matebaland South associated with Edoofa.

The Schools, Institutions, and Educationists who have made efforts to train the students for this prestigious Scholarship Program are also the Authorized designers of EDOOFA in Zimbabwe. We have Mr. Shorwi Kawadza (Retd. Headmaster Hartzell), Mr. Charles Jerera (Retd. Ministry of Education), and Ms. Christina Rockson (Founder and Principal of Hilltop Christian College in SA) who have shown relentless efforts to guide students on the right path to success.EDOOFA boasts a proud Zimbabwean students and parents community of more than 2500 from Zimbabwe who are happy with the quality of education and the employability outcomes.  *I believe you are looking forward to such an opportunity for your career, aren't you?*

I will be guiding you through the financial aspects of the program.  Will they be able to manage the remaining expenses?

140 - 02 Jan 2024 02:49PM - Pallika Edoofa: Thank you for sharing this, I want to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*    Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it
141 - 02 Jan 2024 02:49PM - Pallika Edoofa: And, As your evaluation progresses, I would like to appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country.

128 - 02 Jan 2024 11:41AM - Pallika Edoofa: This enrollment fee is to be paid only if a student qualifies for the Edoofa program and includes your *-Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team* *-Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities* *-Earn While You Learn Program and training* *-University sessions and interactions* *-A guaranteed scholarship seat* *-Visa Documentation Assistance* *The Foster and Care throughout your course*
129 - 02 Jan 2024 11:41AM - Pallika Edoofa: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is *found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
130 - 02 Jan 2024 11:42AM - Pallika Edoofa: Basically, there are 3 phases of the enrollment process.   *Phase 1*: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.   *Phase 2*: Once the students complete Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-level result is out).   *Phase 3*: Once the final A-level results are out if the student has passed the necessary requirements as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission will be continued. However, if the student doesn't meet the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the $350 would be refunded to the parents.   *The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.*

If your child is found eligible for the program in how many days you will have to pay the first part of their enrollment fee?  7. After receiving your offer letter from the University, you will have to pay your registration fee in order to finalize your university selection and reserve your scholarship seat in a particular university, this registration fee would be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship.

309 - 02 Jan 2024 03:27PM - Sahil Edoofa: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zambia is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.  I feel in Zambia, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zambia has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zambian families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.

313 - 02 Jan 2024 03:29PM - Sahil Edoofa: Ideally as you know, the tentative dates: 1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 8th or 9th January 2024 for $200 and the 8th or 9th of February for the remaining $150. 2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 8th or 9th January 2024. Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?

18 - 02 Jan 2024 01:44PM - +263 77 289 2775: Admission Process 1. In the first step, the students have to receive proper information about the Edoofa program so that they understand the unique benefits and the value what we are doing for them. (This step happens when students are in Africa and can happen on either call, WhatsApp, email or any other online medium.) 2. In the second step, Edoofa eligibility check is done and interview is taken. (This also happens while the students are in Africa.) Once the students are found eligible by evaluating their transcripts/grades and performance in the interview, they are offered the chance of enrolment in the Edoofa program 3. The third step is the Acceptance Letter from Edoofa, in this step if you manage to clear the Interview Process, then you get selected into our Program and get an Acceptance Letter from Edoofa 4. The fourth Step involves finalizing your enrolment into the Edoofa Program by completing our Edoofa Enrolment Fee formalities (fee ranges from $350-$750 depending upon the admission cycle): Once the student pays the registration fee, Edoofa helps in generating the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) from the University/college as well as the visa letter which Edoofa also helps in mailing to the Indian High Commission in the particular country for the purpose of Visa. All the necessary help and information regarding the Visa process will be provided by the Edoofa Admission officers at the stage . 5.In the Fifth Step, once the enrolment is completed, our students rely on the full-fledged support provided by our admission officers. No other college or programme has this level of conviction towards comforting the students and providing a wonderful experience to them. To get admission via our scholarship fund. (This process also happens while the students remain in their home country and they are directly going to be connecting with University representatives.). Once the university sessions are over, students secure the Admission offer letter (LOI) from the respective universities based on Edoofa's recommendation and then the student is expected to pay Registration fees (ranging from $500-$750) to confirm their admission with in a stipulated time frame. 6. In the Sixth Step, once the student pays the registration fee, Edoofa helps in generating the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) from the University/college as well as the visa letter. Edoofa also guides in the mailing process to the Indian High Commission in the particular country for the purpose of Visa. All the necessary help and information regarding the Visa process will be provided by the Edoofa Admission officers at this stage.

This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year.

45 - 02 Jan 2024 02:00PM - Sahil Edoofa: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*
46 - 02 Jan 2024 02:01PM - Sahil Edoofa: So now shall I brief you about *Bachelor of Arts - Bachelor in Legislative Law*?
47 - 02 Jan 2024 02:01PM - +27 67 102 6447: Okay I hear you

This course is made for the students who are able to formulate sound arguments, can think laterally and possess problem solving skills.  A course in BA LLB is an exciting one that offers multiple career opportunities. The 5 key positions associated with this course are:  *1) Legal Advisor* The main role of a legal advisor or legal counsellor is to offer legal advice and work, for organizations and the employees of the organization. Their services can be utilized by the Government, NGOs, other associations or large organizations.  The legal advisors are in-house experts, in contrast to attorneys and supporters who offer their services to society in general. It is often seen that legal advisors were former advocates and therefore their skills and training have to be in accordance with those that are needed for attorneys and advocates.  *2) Lawyer* As is evident by the title, is a person whose profession is law. There are different specializations for law including Cyber law, Environmental law, Company law, Criminal law and Family Law.

They then go on to represent and defend their clients in the court.  *3) Public Prosecutor* A Public Prosecutor is a criminal lawyer who is hired by the government. He may either be hired by the central or the state government to represent the interests of the state in any criminal trial. Their role starts once the police have investigated and filed the charge sheet in court.

The criminal procedure code of 1973 under section 24, outlines the arrangements concerning the Public Prosecutor.  *4) Judge* This role is considered to be very prestigious by any law student. Immediately after the completion of graduation, an individual can appear for a lower judiciary exam. The age group depending on different states varies between 21 to 35 years.

This job requires a degree from ICSI or the Institute of Company secretaries of India. A lot of dedication and hard work is required to complete this course with your law degree, but on successful completion, this career can be extremely rewarding.  A career in law is considered to be much sought after, satisfying and lucrative.  *Required Skill-Set for BA LLB* It is rightly said that learning is an on – going process and this holds true especially in the aspect of personal and professional development. Although an individual may possess certain skills they need to be improved and developed constantly. A few key skills that are of paramount importance in the field of law are:  *Good Written Communication*– Writing forms a major part of the work in in the legal profession. The written communication involves letters, documents, notices, and so on. The documents must be grammatically correct and error free. This requires a good level of English proficiency.  *Good Verbal Communication*– A lot depends on how well the legal professional can express his or her case, arguments and generally converse with clients and authorities. Good verbal communication ensures good expression and understanding which are crucial for a successful career in law.  *Good Time Management*– In the legal profession, time management is very crucial. The art of delegating tasks, working within deadlines, and prioritizing tasks to achieve success is very essential.  *A great degree of self-confidence*– This profession needs a high degree of self-confidence to win the clients’ trust. A strong belief in yourself will go a long way in winning arguments and cases.  *An analytical mind and good research skills*– A case with proper research and well-reasoned out and evaluated argument stands a very high chance of success.  *High EQ (Emotional Quotient)*– Individuals in the legal profession, especially lawyers, must learn to be empathetic.  *Tech Savvy*– In the rapidly developing and evolving technological world, they must be abreast of the latest technology to understand and use it, as and when needed. They need to use technology to their advantage to improve their efficiency and chances of success.  *Good Commercial awareness*– This is not only restricted to being aware of the current trends and technology, prevalent in the world of business and law, but also being aware of the developments in the world of business and law, both nationally and globally.  *A high degree of patience*– This is a much needed skill, since you deal with different types of people and some cases and procedures stretch over a period of time which need a lot of patience and careful handling.  *Team player skills*– Since a legal professional will deal with a lot of people therefore to be effective they need to bond with people. The art of getting work done and obtaining information though networking and working with people helps in attaining the objectives.

77 - 02 Jan 2024 01:49PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, if you had researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India, he/she has to crack the entrance exam, NEET, which selects only a limited number of students from a vast pool of applicants. NEET (National Eligibility cum Entrance Test) is challenging due to its comprehensive syllabus, fierce competition, and the need to excel in biology, physics, and chemistry, making it a demanding examination for aspiring medical students.
78 - 02 Jan 2024 02:06PM - +263 78 910 8942: Do I have to pay for this entrance exam
79 - 02 Jan 2024 02:08PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Certainly, Trish. This is an extremely competitive exam. Furthermore, you need to have to have a student visa to give the exam, please.
80 - 02 Jan 2024 02:31PM - +263 78 910 8942: I believe can take it. Student visa what is it for
81 - 02 Jan 2024 03:07PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Trish. I would like to inform you that in order to travel to India for the exam, you will need a student visa. Obtaining this visa typically requires enrolling in a university or educational institution in India. Therefore, pursuing a course of study in India is a prerequisite for traveling to the country to take the exam.
76 - 02 Jan 2024 01:30PM - +263 78 910 8942: About choosing area of specialisation....after a careful scrutiny into the medical field, the neuro department nerds more people....because it doesn't due to its complexity & I also felt the need to reach out to those little kids with neurological disorders because they have the potential to change the world to a better place therefore we need to make sure that their medical needs are met & also the department is better paying therefore I can fulfil my dreams
77 - 02 Jan 2024 01:49PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, if you had researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India, he/she has to crack the entrance exam, NEET, which selects only a limited number of students from a vast pool of applicants. NEET (National Eligibility cum Entrance Test) is challenging due to its comprehensive syllabus, fierce competition, and the need to excel in biology, physics, and chemistry, making it a demanding examination for aspiring medical students.
78 - 02 Jan 2024 02:06PM - +263 78 910 8942: Do I have to pay for this entrance exam
79 - 02 Jan 2024 02:08PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Certainly, Trish. This is an extremely competitive exam. Furthermore, you need to have to have a student visa to give the exam, please.

Obtaining this visa typically requires enrolling in a university or educational institution in India. Therefore, pursuing a course of study in India is a prerequisite for traveling to the country to take the exam.

90 - 02 Jan 2024 02:36PM - +263 77 432 3058: Ok , so it is the study of cardiovascular system  one will be dealing with disorders of the heart and the cardiovascular system. The field includes medical diagnosis and treatment of heart failure , coronary artery disease and heart failure. That's all I know.
91 - 02 Jan 2024 03:05PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: BSc Cardiovascular Technology  *BSc Cardiovascular Technology* is a 3-year degree program that deals with diagnosing and monitoring diseases related to the heart and the circulatory system.  In this program, students will get familiar with various complex procedures such as performing stent implants, setting up cardiac pacemakers and defibrillators in the treatment of heart diseases.  The BSc Cardiovascular Technology syllabus includes subjects such as Human Anatomy, Cardiovascular System, Physiology, Pathology, Electrocardiography and Echocardiography.  BSc Cardiovascular Technology degree holders will be able to find work in various sectors such as Hospitals, Universities, Health organizations etc.  They may also serve as Cardiovascular Technician, Cardiovascular Technologist, Medical Sonographer, etc. Graduates have the opportunity to work in India or Abroad to pursue graduate studies and to get involved in research activities.  After completing this course, students can pursue higher studies and advanced academic exploration along with research through MSc and Certificate Courses. Students can also pursue MBA, PGDM courses. These courses essentially provides a solid basis for further studies and related prospects.  *BSc Cardiovascular Technology: What is it about?* Read the points given below to know what BSc Cardiovascular Technology course is all about:  BSc in Cardiovascular Technology deals with various topics on the vascular or the circulatory system. Through this course, one gets to learn about the arteries, veins and the blood vessels that carry blood throughout the human body. These blood vessels are also instrumental in delivering oxygen and essential nutrients to the body tissues.  With the help of this course one gets to learn about the various cardiovascular diseases that affect the human body.   This course also helps a cardiovascular technologist or technician to learn about the various procedures and tests while assisting the physician in diagnosing and treating a patient ailing from heart disease. Some of the complex procedures that a student learns in this course are implanting of stents and setting up a pacemaker. They learn through this course, both invasive  as well as non-invasive procedures in the treatment of heart diseases.  *Why Should You Study a BSc Cardiovascular Technology course?*  BSc Cardiovascular Technology is a prestigious and popular stream of study in the field of allied health sciences. This field of study has a lot of importance and applications as it concerns directly with the treatment of heart diseases. Let us see here some of the reasons why one should study B.Sc Cardiovascular Technology.  With more and more people suffering from heart diseases because of many factors including lifestyle, genetics and environment, the importance of this field of study is ever increasing. Cardiologists and other heart surgeons greatly depend upon the services and support of cardiovascular technologists and technicians for carrying out various complex procedures on patients suffering from heart ailments.   With congenital heart diseases too on the rise, that is those that are prevalent in patients from birth itself, there is an increased awareness among different walks of people about the risks associated with such heart diseases. This in turn, further brings the field in limelight, as people are more likely to avail the services of a cardiovascular technologist. The numerous advances in the medical field in this domain has been a boon for patients and the medical fraternity alike. With rapid advances in the field, the services are getting more and more affordable, with many availing such services.

93 - 02 Jan 2024 03:14PM - +263 77 432 3058: So how many points do you expect from a student inorder to study this degree
94 - 02 Jan 2024 03:19PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*  Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it!
95 - 02 Jan 2024 03:21PM - +263 77 432 3058: I'm confident I will not get less than 10 points , I will try to be more serious and hardworking",No,No

163 - 02 Jan 2024 12:51PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I must say your grasping power is impeccable! Now moving forward, as far as I can tell, you recognize *Edoofa's* commitment to providing high-quality university education to its students, so that upon completion of their studies, they would be able to achieve their career goals and have a bright future.  Are you familiar with the cost of similar quality of higher education for an international student who does not have access to a scholarship?
164 - 02 Jan 2024 12:53PM - +263 78 115 4509: Not affordable due to that mostly  there are too  expensive
165 - 02 Jan 2024 12:54PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Not to worry, Nyasha! Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth properly.  In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around $6000-$8000 per year. Now this is very low as compared to other Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc. It is still beyond the reach of many. So with the Edoofa Scholarship Program the cost trips down to $2000-$3000 for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying in the Eligibility check Process. This cost includes: 1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any) 2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Gym, Laundry, etc.) 3. Food 4. Accommodation
224 - 02 Jan 2024 02:19PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So now as we have discussed about the payment policy of the Enrollment fee and other finances of the program as well, so can you share with me what all did you understand about the financial aspects of the program and how Edoofa helps a student arrange and pay his/her finances by themselves?
225 - 02 Jan 2024 02:27PM - +263 78 115 4509: Oky from our discussion l understand that you help the students on application, you also help the students with the visa Documentation assistance and SLC classes
226 - 02 Jan 2024 02:29PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Let me summarize the financial aspects for you.  *Enrollment fee* The enrollment fee is $350 out of which you need to pay only $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 is to be paid in next 30 days  For all the services and assistance including Applications, SOP, Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection, and sessions, etc all you need to pay is $350  *Cost of education* The cost of education is reduced from $6000-$8000 to $2000-$3000 per annum which includes Tuition fee, Accommodation, Food, Wifi, Laundry, Library, Gym fee, etc!  This cost can be further reduced through the earnings from Earn While You Learn program.

229 - 02 Jan 2024 03:01PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, we are at stage one but we have also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.  *Step 1: Connect with a counselor* - As your counselor, now we are going through the counseling process, discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.  *Step 2: Eligibility Check* - The eligibility check includes the interviews with the Academic Board and Test.  *Step 3: Acceptance Letter from Edoofa* - If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!  *Step 4: Enrollment into the Edoofa Program* - This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.  We are left with 5 and 6. So shall I explain it to you?
230 - 02 Jan 2024 03:04PM - +263 78 115 4509: Yes sir you can continue explaining
231 - 02 Jan 2024 03:04PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Step 5: After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors , they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by making a payment of the registration fee within a few weeks.  This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself and after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).  Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment($500-$1000) will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.  I hope you are clear with the process?
232 - 02 Jan 2024 03:09PM - +263 78 115 4509: Oky sir it's clear to me thank you for your assistance

274 - 02 Jan 2024 04:09PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I would like to inform you that the program gives an equal opportunity to every student to self-finance their own education through the Earn While You Learn program and there is no upper limit for the credits. Benefiting from the *Earn While You Learn program depends on the student's diligence. This program has consistently proved its reliability over the past 6 years. There are students who are working hard and have self-financed their entire fees and they even made surplus credits, therefore, resulting in the students sending the amount back to their parents to help them financially. So, If the student is not adamant about working hard, no program will be reliable enough to support him/her. Let me share an example of Persistence, one of our students.

195 - 02 Jan 2024 02:16PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be  1) *Application Form*  2) *Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.  3) *Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university, isn't it?

207 - 02 Jan 2024 03:01PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.

554 - 02 Jan 2024 10:05AM - Shubham Madhwal: You can simply understand the financial part of the program in 3 parts.  1. The Enrollment fee is $350 which includes application forms, statement of purpose, letter of recommendation, visa assistance, Earn While You Learn Program's training etc. A part of this fee would be due 7 days from getting the Letter of Acceptance.  2. Basically, this registration fee will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 instalments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024- 2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).  3. The Annual fee after the scholarship as discussed above would be between $2000-$3000, and this would include Accommodation, Food Expenses and Basic University Expenses such as exam fee, Library Fee, Lab Fee
555 - 02 Jan 2024 10:12AM - +263 77 294 4709: How much is part 2 and is it an additional cost on top of the $2000-$3000 anual fees

557 - 02 Jan 2024 10:16AM - +263 77 294 4709: What about visa applications and air tickets
558 - 02 Jan 2024 11:06AM - Shubham Madhwal: If you understand the concept of international education finances that play a major role are not visa fees and flight tickets. The flight ticket is required a very limited number of times as the students don't travel that often. I don't mean to say that students can not go back to their country, they can definitely go back to enjoy the holidays. What I have personally seen is, the students do not travel that often. So, considering the main finance which plays the most important role in international education is the annual fees. So, to reduce this annual fee, edoofa helps a student with the Earn While You Learn Program. This program provides the students with an opportunity to earn scholarship credits which in return help them to make their education more affordable.

559 - 02 Jan 2024 11:06AM - Shubham Madhwal: Visa fees and flight tickets are to be bought just a month before they plan to come to India. So, let's say the student wants to come to India in August 2024, This means that his family has to cover the Visa fee and the ticket in July 2024. If you understand the concept properly, till July 2024, the student will be working in the Earn While You Learn program and will be earning Scholarship credits. Now, with this opportunity, you can save a lot of money on the annual fee which in return helps you to make your flight ticket and the Visa fee affordable.  As mentioned to you already, the scholarship covers the tuition fees as you see, the Edoofa scholarship is basically the scholarship seats acquired from the universities for their good work in the past 14 years in the higher education space. So the travel costs will have to be covered by the student, But our admission team assist you in all the steps. So that you get the cheapest air travel tickets and also acquire the visa with ease.

215 - 02 Jan 2024 04:22PM - Shubham Madhwal: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.  Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it

214 - 02 Jan 2024 05:03PM - Shubham Madhwal: Our Academician Mr Piyush visited Zimbabwe in the month of March this year for around 70 days to conduct various workshops for the students regarding the Edoofa Program, from his experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,  While the cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, the cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time.  This means roughly $1100 is spent on just food while the cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, and travelling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year.  Wouldn't you agree to the same?
215 - 02 Jan 2024 05:09PM - +263 77 693 3511: May be I'm not sure of now.  But my experience with my elder daughter's tertiary education our budget was less than that.

216 - 02 Jan 2024 05:18PM - Shubham Madhwal: And may I know what was her budget. So that I can help you understand better?
217 - 02 Jan 2024 05:25PM - +263 77 693 3511: She was paying $$1080 /year. She stayed at home. Had transport cost of $20usd a month x 10months and that's $200. Once a student is enwith a university, she/he gets free internet as long as he/she's paid up
218 - 02 Jan 2024 05:27PM - +263 77 693 3511: $540x2 semesters=$1080+$200= $1280. Plus a pocket money.. in all it never goes beyond $1500. Of course there are expensive universities... but parents choose what they can afford
219 - 02 Jan 2024 05:43PM - Shubham Madhwal: And in which year did she complete her education please?

222 - 02 Jan 2024 05:52PM - +263 77 693 3511: Definitely I do. Even though Things are going up this side.  our salaries hardly increase. Beside sir, we've got an o level student , our young daughter,  who's suppose to sit for her final exams . She needs examination fees. That's too much for us.
223 - 02 Jan 2024 05:58PM - Shubham Madhwal: Yes please, if you roughly calculate, Then fees in today's time for the same university in which Mzimazisi elder sibling studied at will be around $2500 and above, Wouldn't you agree?",No,No

257 - 02 Jan 2024 12:12PM - Shubham Madhwal: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.  Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it

325 - 02 Jan 2024 03:10PM - Shubham Madhwal: You see in the first mode, the Direct Bank Transfer Mode, the transfer charges which are to be borne by the parents of the student ranges between $80 to $100 which becomes quite high for a lot of parents considering the economic situation in Zimbabwe itself. So as not every student is in a position to cater for an additional $80 to $100 just as a transfer charge, the second mode was introduced, wherein, it is the Bank deposit in Mr Shorwi's Account.  So as you can see in the letter there is a Bank deposit in, Mr Shorwi Ex-Principal of Hartzell High School's account as he is our Associated Partner there in Zimbabwe
326 - 02 Jan 2024 03:10PM - Shubham Madhwal: The fee payment can also be made through Hartzell High. School Ex-Principal himself. Since his account is a NOSTRO Account which only holds USD itself, *the necessary amount including the transfer charges in this mode itself would be 12.5% of the fees you are paying* the same details are as below:-  BANK NAME: FBC  BRANCH: Mutare  ACC NAME: Kawadza Shorwi  ACC NUMBER: 5333 0380 0918 0214  CONTACT NUMBER: +263 77 364 0738
