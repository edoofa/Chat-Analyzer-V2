2/1/24, 9:14 AM - Aditi Edoofa: You're very welcome! 🌟 It's great to have you here.
2/1/24, 9:15 AM - Aditi Edoofa: @263771987801 I would like to begin this journey by knowing you beyond the _Statement of Purpose._ Can you share with me what are your long-term goals and how do you think this EWYL Program will help you in achieving them?
2/1/24, 9:21 AM - +263 77 198 7801: Ok 

My long term goal is to be financially independent and to be the manager of my own businesses. This EWYL program will help me in the sense that I will have practical skills of business  management
2/1/24, 9:25 AM - Aditi Edoofa: That's a fantastic long-term goal! Building financial independence and becoming the manager of your own businesses are ambitious and empowering objectives. The EWYL program is indeed a valuable opportunity to equip yourself with practical skills in business management, which can be crucial for achieving your entrepreneurial aspirations. 🌐📈

2/1/24, 9:28 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Yes!
2/1/24, 9:29 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
2/1/24, 9:30 AM - +263 77 198 7801: Yes I do understand them
2/1/24, 9:32 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Can you brief me about them? <This message was edited>
2/1/24, 9:35 AM - +263 77 198 7801: To produce students who are job ready and to make qaulity education accessible
2/1/24, 9:36 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
2/1/24, 9:36 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the first goal is to ensure that all Edoofians have an equal opportunity to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a systematic program/curriculum in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
2/1/24, 9:36 AM - Aditi Edoofa: The second goal is to help all our edoofians self-finance their education, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
2/1/24, 9:39 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Thank you all for your active participation and as we conclude, keep the enthusiasm alive and continue striving towards your objectives.🎯
2/1/24, 9:42 AM - +263 77 198 7801: Thanks my dear for the wonderful time and effective discussion we had.
2/1/24, 9:45 AM - Aditi Edoofa: You're welcome!
