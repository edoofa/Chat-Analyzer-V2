26/12/23, 8:53 AM - +27 74 372 5998: Good morning Ms Aditi I'm Mr Killian u are welcome
26/12/23, 8:57 AM - Aditi Edoofa: @27624990315 @27743725998 Your support for Trish on her EWYL journey is invaluable, and I'm sure it will contribute to her success.
26/12/23, 8:57 AM - Aditi Edoofa: I would like to begin this journey by knowing you beyond the _Statement of Purpose._ Can you share with me what are your long-term goals and how do you think this EWYL Program will help you in achieving them?
26/12/23, 9:06 AM - +27 67 235 2935: Well Ms Aditi, my long term goal is to go study in India at the best institution pursuing my course which is Bachelor of science in physiotherapy and get my degree. After obtaining my degree, I also dream of having my own medical practice as a qualified physiotherapist. The EWYL program will create a platform for me to gain more knowledge, skills and experience that will prepare me for the world of work . By earning scholarship credits, I will be able to self finance my education which will give me a sense of independence. Above all what makes this journey exciting is that I will be guided by  my mentor which is you throughout the journey which gives me more hope and dedication believing that I will be able to achieve this long term goal 🤗
26/12/23, 9:09 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Your aspirations are truly commendable! Pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Physiotherapy and eventually establishing your own medical practice reflect a strong commitment to your education and future career. I'm excited to be your mentor and support you on this journey. Together, we'll work towards achieving your goals, and the EWYL program is indeed an excellent opportunity for you to gain the knowledge and experience needed.🚀
26/12/23, 9:10 AM - +27 67 235 2935: Thank you 😊🤗your dedication is truly appreciated and I'm so excited to be guided by you on this journey Ms Aditi 🤗
26/12/23, 9:12 AM - Aditi Edoofa: You're welcome Trish!
26/12/23, 9:12 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
26/12/23, 9:15 AM - +27 67 235 2935: I'm not really sure Ms Aditi 🤗
26/12/23, 9:15 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
26/12/23, 9:15 AM - Aditi Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
26/12/23, 9:17 AM - +27 67 235 2935: I understand Ms Aditi 🙃🤝
26/12/23, 9:17 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skillset through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
26/12/23, 9:20 AM - +27 67 235 2935: I would like to greet Ms Sanjana and Ms Davi and I truly appreciate their dedication to support young ambitious students like me to pursue their dreams in order to achieve our goals 🤝 Thank you
26/12/23, 9:23 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Indeed!
They are also honored to have you!
26/12/23, 9:23 AM - Aditi Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
26/12/23, 9:24 AM - +27 67 235 2935: Very interesting 🤗🤗
26/12/23, 9:27 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 10 minutes should be enough.

28/12/23, 8:31 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Awesome!

1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound ?
28/12/23, 8:34 AM - +27 67 235 2935: Sounds interesting and exciting 🤗 thank you so much
28/12/23, 8:36 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
28/12/23, 8:36 AM - Aditi Edoofa: I would like to ask you a few questions to understand how much from our discussion you could retain and if there is anything for us to discuss again.
28/12/23, 8:36 AM - Aditi Edoofa: So here are the questions, answer them in detail:

1. Share a small introduction of everyone on your  EWYL team.
2. What goals has your mentor set for your EWYL journey?
3. How does Mr. Angad Singh, founder of Edoofa, interact with all students?
A. Newsletter       B. Youtube

4. Explain in your own words what the Hall of Inspiration is.
28/12/23, 8:52 AM - +27 67 235 2935: 1.On my EWYL team, I have my dearest mentor Ms Aditi , I have Ms Sanjana who is the Head of the Department and Ms Davi the Head coach.

2.My mentor has set up three goals for my EWYL journey which are:
-To make sure that my academic journey is great 
- To ensure that I am given enough opportunities to self finance my higher education in India and lastly
-To work towards attaining the objective (which involves learning and evolving with the relevant 21st century skills in order to prepare me for the real world work place and to grow.

3.A.Newsletter

4.The Hall of inspiration according to my understanding is a  part of the newsletter where Edoofians like me get to learn and be motivated by receiving and reading words of inspiration from Mr Angad Singh and where we get to learn and reflect from other Edoofians and their experiences.
The Hall of inspiration also shares motivational quotes 🤗
28/12/23, 8:52 AM - Aditi Edoofa: This is fantastic, Trish!❤️

29/12/23, 8:52 AM - +27 67 235 2935: I understand 😊 Ms Aditi however as I mentioned that I do have some concerns about all the projects which I believe could be a problem for me
29/12/23, 8:55 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, would you please elaborate on that.
29/12/23, 9:29 AM - +27 67 235 2935: Alright 😊 thank you.
Well Ms Aditi, as I was studying all the projects in the EWYL program I realised that connecting with the companies and other students would be difficult for me even though I would be trying. The reason I am saying this is that I'm currently living in South Africa and it is during the holiday season and most companies I already had in mind are closed . The reason why I doubt that I could pull of the first project is that, the last time I checked, here in South Africa, living as a foreigner is very difficult because what's occuring recently is that the government and political parties are already deciding to remove all foreigners including Zimbabweans , Nigerians and etc. Most South African citizens are already claiming that foreigners are taking their jobs and they want nothing to do with them, this appeared on the recent news. I am a student who does my research very well   and I love taking risks but I  came to realise that going against certain laws will affect my future as a student considering that I am in a foreign country and there are events like xenophobia that takes place which has already affected some of us . Based on project 2 as I wanted to stay prepared already,  I remember applying for the Edoofa scholarship program and I even asked my school mates if they are interested and explaining how it works to them but their responses were very  difficult to answer myself. Most students here in South Africa get full funded scholarships and bursaries from the government considering their good grades and most of them told me that they are used to scholarships that fund fully and they are not used to 50%-100%scholarships as mentioned here in the Edoofa. I did not know how to answer that . I could have also applied here in South Africa but because I am not a South African citizen I did not qualify for all the bursaries that it is why I considered applying abroad and came across the Edoofa scholarship program. 
Most Schools and Organisations this side are most focused on funding and empowering their own citizens which would make it difficult for me to make them understand about this program and they might not take me seriously because I am a foreigner. Considering that most schools and most companies are closed it would be difficult to connect with them. Besides the South African issue, Most of my cousins and friends who are Zimbabweans who I think would want to enroll in the Edoofa program will be completing their secondary years in 2027 so it would be difficult for me.
I am really dedicated and I am willing to try and achieve these tasks but those are the difficulties I would be facing when I try to work on the projects 🤗 Hopefully you will understand thank you.
29/12/23, 9:30 AM - +27 67 235 2935: I apologize for taking too long🤗
29/12/23, 9:45 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Allow me some time to go through this Trish and I will get back to you on this, okay?

So, now I am going to share another audio file and we’ll follow the same process- you ensure you don’t miss anything in it and use this time to play this audio more than once, let’s get to it!
2/1/24, 9:16 AM - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>

The purpose of this project is to connect and build positive relationships with other people and work towards specific goals
2/1/24, 9:27 AM - Aditi Edoofa: That’s awesome, I’m confident that if you continue to pay attention to the information shared and then respond accordingly, we will make a great team. Now, here are 2 things I’d like to briefly remind you of from the Community Building Project.
