26/12/23, 1:35 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Geilen!

I really hope that your Christmas went well. Let's discuss how we celebrated our Christmas this year in our session! Come on, join your EWYL Line, and let's talk about our celebration!
26/12/23, 2:34 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I was so excited to talk to you about the Christmas celebrations, however, you did not show up! May I ask if you are facing any challenges?
27/12/23, 1:28 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Geilen! What did one wall say to the other wall?

I'll meet you at the corner!' Now that we've built a little humor, let's construct some great ideas in today's session.😄
27/12/23, 1:32 PM - +263 78 977 5405: How are you doing mentor
27/12/23, 1:34 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I have observed that you have not been consistent and punctual in attending your sessions. As your mentor, I am concerned about your progress, and I would like you to discuss with me if you are facing any challenges. How will we learn and earn credits if you do not attend the sessions on time?
27/12/23, 1:37 PM - +263 78 977 5405: Currently I am on my way to Mutare.. Coming from our farm where I have been facing network issues
27/12/23, 2:00 PM - Ananya Edoofa: You have been inconsistent since 12th of December, Geilen!
27/12/23, 2:18 PM - +263 78 977 5405: Pardon for that... Sorry for not staying in touch.. I was away and couldn't have access to my usual communication channels
27/12/23, 2:19 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, I will start by explaining the projects in detail. I am sharing an audio file with you. Here’s my suggestion- listen to it at least twice, you know- to make sure we don’t miss anything out, and then get back to me when you are finished with the process!

27/12/23, 2:41 PM - +263 78 977 5405: Ok mentor... The venture is looking for potential companies that can collaborate with EDOOFA, eager to extend their assistance in the overall development of all the students that enroll for EDOOFA programme
There are factors I should take into consideration and these include nature of company, financial stability, background and founder etc...
28/12/23, 1:35 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Geilen!

As we embark on today's session, I'd like to set a positive tone with a motivating quote:

"Success is not final, failure is not fatal: It is the courage to continue that count." - Winston Churchill

Let's approach our work today with determination and a mindset geared towards progress. Together, we can achieve great things. Looking forward to a productive and inspiring session!🚀

28/12/23, 2:17 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Geilen, why are you late today?
28/12/23, 2:31 PM - +263 78 977 5405: In our region we are facing heavy rains that is causing network issues
28/12/23, 4:44 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, Geilen! I understand. Many of my students have been complaining about the rain.
28/12/23, 4:56 PM - +263 78 977 5405: Yes.. Till the 31st of December
29/12/23, 2:56 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Well, I was expecting a response from your end, however since our session time is over, I am including our session for today.

As our session concludes, and we are going to embark on a new chapter at the dawn of the New Year, I wanted to take a moment to send my warmest wishes your way. May this coming year be filled with joy, laughter, and moments of profound happiness. 🌈

Along with you, the Edoofa Family will also be occupied in New Year Celebrations from tomorrow till 1 January 2024 and we will resume from 2 January onwards🎉

Wishing you a year ahead filled with love, prosperity, and the fulfillment of your heart's desires. May every day be a chance for you to shine and make a positive impact ✨

2/1/24, 1:36 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Geilen !

Before we dive into today's session, I'm curious – how was your New Year? Did you have a chance to celebrate and welcome the new chapter?
2/1/24, 2:11 PM - +263 78 977 5405: Mine was great... I hope yours was filled with joy and prosperity
2/1/24, 2:12 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Gelien, why are you late?
2/1/24, 2:28 PM - +263 78 977 5405: I'm very sorry I was late for our session. I was attending a church service, and it ran longer than I expected. I understand that my tardiness was inconvenient, and I apologize for any trouble it caused. I would like to suggest that we reschedule our session for a different time, as I will not be available for the next 7 days because the prayers start in the morning from 4 to 6 am, then afternoon session from 12to 2 pm and then the last session at 4 to 6 pm. I hope you can understand and that we can work out a solution that is convenient for both of us. Thank you for your understanding.
2/1/24, 2:29 PM - Ananya Edoofa: So, shall we connect at 8:30 a.m. in the morning?
2/1/24, 2:34 PM - +263 78 977 5405: Thank you so much for understanding and for rescheduling our session. I really appreciate your flexibility and willingness to work with me. I look forward to meeting with you at the 8.30 tomorrow. Thank you again for being so understanding....
2/1/24, 2:47 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Alright!
