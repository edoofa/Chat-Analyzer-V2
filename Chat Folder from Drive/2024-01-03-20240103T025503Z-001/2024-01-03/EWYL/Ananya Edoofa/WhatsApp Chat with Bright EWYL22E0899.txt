I hope this message finds you well amidst your ongoing exams. I couldn't help but notice that I haven't received a Christmas greeting from you. I understand that exam preparations are consuming much of your time and energy, but it's disheartening to see that you couldn't spare a couple of minutes to extend your wishes.

As your mentor, I've been supportive and have even provided you with holidays to dedicate to your exam preparations. However, it's disconcerting to witness a lack of acknowledgment or a brief moment taken to convey your holiday wishes.

Is there something on your mind, or is there a reason for this silence?

I am doing well ma'am I was really wait to congratulate you happy new year not that the birth of Christ is not important but according to my faith I celebrate it every day because the birth of Christ is life but new year it's an achievement and a blessed from God
28/12/23, 4:23 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good evening, Bright!

I understand that things have not always aligned with how they are planned. It's life, dear; one will face many instances in their life. However, moving out of your comfort zone is something you do when you wish to move ahead in your life.

Being your mentor, I am always here to listen and help you. However, I understand that sometimes your mentor can also feel a bit neglected. Therefore, always try to answer or respond to whatever has been asked.

[1] Give thanks to the Lord, for he is good; his love endures forever. [2] Let Israel say: “His love endures forever.” [3] Let the house of Aaron say: “His love endures forever.” [4] Let those who fear the Lord say: “His love endures forever.”
