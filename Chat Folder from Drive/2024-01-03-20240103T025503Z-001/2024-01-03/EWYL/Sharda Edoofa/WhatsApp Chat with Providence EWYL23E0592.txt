Christmas is a special time of year that bring family together.its a time to make memories that will last a lifetime. People all around the world celebrate this holiday in different ways. 

Every year , l decorate my home with beautiful Christmas tree, and l hang lights and ornaments around the house


I always attend church services and reflect on true meaning of Christmas. 

For me , it's a special time to remember what's important in life.one thing l love the most about Christmas is the spirit of giving seeing people's faces light up when they receive a gift is one of the most wonderful things in the world. 

The true meaning of Christmas is about giving from the heart, and that's what makes it so magical 


#Merry Christmas 🎄🎁and a blissful New year ✨✨

I have set several goals for myself. In terms of academics, l plan to maintain a high a high grade point average. I plan to develop a study schedule that allows me to effectively balance my course work and outside commitments. In addition, l plan to take courses that challenge me and help me grow as a student and a person 

In terms of personal development, reading is an important part of my goal to broaden my perspective and learn new things. I also plan to practice mindfulness and meditation on daily basis. I have heard that these practices can help reduce stress , improve focus , and promote overall well-being. I think this will be beneficial to me as a student, and l believe it will help me stay calm and focused during busy and stressful times. 

I have identified several organisations that are doing meaningful work in my community and that align with my personal interests. I plan to contact these organisations and see what opportunities are available for me to get involved.  I believe that volunteering is a great way to give back to the community and to make positive impact on others. I also think it will be a rewarding and fulfilling experience for me personally. 

One thing l will do is create a daily schedule that incorporates time for studying, reading, volunteering and other activities. I will also set smaller goals within each larger goal , so that l can track my progress and stay motivated. I will also stop spending time with the wrong people 

That's how l plan to accomplish these goals in 2024

Have a blissful New year✨🥳
