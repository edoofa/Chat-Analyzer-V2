3. Surprise!! An Additional Opportunity to earn $25 worth of Scholarship Credits when 5 students complete their enrollment from one particular school!
2/1/24, 2:44 PM - +263 71 871 0127: Okay
2/1/24, 2:47 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Before we start, I want you to answer the questions that I am sharing below:

Q2. Please share the messages that you will use when you reach out to the School Heads.
Q3. Name of the Province where your school is located.
2/1/24, 3:05 PM - +263 71 871 0127: 1. Sandringham High School, not connected to edoofa

2. Greetings my name is Talent Mazarura student of Sandrigham High from 2022 to 2023. I got a chance in the Edoofa Scholarship program for my higher education. With this program l get to have 50 percent of my annual fees covered and can also level up to 100 percent through the use of the EWYL program. The Earn While You Learn (EWYL) program offers tasks to do while studying and each task is worth of scholarship credits. I found this opportunity amazing and l would like my former school mates to get such an opportunity therefore l was hoping for Sandringham to be in constant touch with Edoofa to further ease the process of admission in the Edoofa program. let me know your thoughts on connecting your school with Edoofa.
2/1/24, 3:06 PM - +263 71 871 0127: 3.  Norton Mashonaland West
2/1/24, 3:10 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Since your school is currently not connected with Edoofa, an organization that offers the opportunity to study abroad and acquire a world-class education at an affordable price.

I believe it would be beneficial for your school to establish a connection with Edoofa. By doing so, you can ensure that students have access to a wider range of educational opportunities and experiences that extend beyond the boundaries of the local education system. Do you agree?
2/1/24, 3:18 PM - +263 71 871 0127: Yeah
2/1/24, 3:19 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, Now our first task is to get the number of the School headmaster. 
There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to your Headmaster at School with whom you were close and ask him/her for the School Head’s Contact.
Even before that, you can ask your schoolmates peers, or neighbors if they have their School Head’s Contact.
2/1/24, 3:19 PM - +263 71 871 0127: Okay
2/1/24, 3:28 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Now. it is time to wrap up the session. It was lovely talking to you. 

*Now, we will meet tomorrow for the session at 1:30 pm.* 
Till then take care and have a great day ahead!
2/1/24, 3:34 PM - +263 71 871 0127: Have a nice day
