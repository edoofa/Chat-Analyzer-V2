28/12/23, 10:03 AM - Saloni Edoofa: Okay, that’s wonderful. Tatenda- I want you to share your understanding of the document with me. I just want to ensure we don’t miss anything! So, please, go on sharing your understanding of the above document.
28/12/23, 10:24 AM - +263 77 822 9060: Okay . So the first project is Corporate Alliances .
This project requires students to research about different companies with different networking systems that promote the development to be made by the young people . The key point I learned was that one has to be ready to be either rejected by some companies and be sure to try again until one gets what they want
28/12/23, 10:28 AM - +263 77 822 9060: The second project is Community Building .
This project requires the students to have a network where they share more about Edoofa to people around them and internationally.  The students would also be able to create a social impact for themselves and others
28/12/23, 10:33 AM - Saloni Edoofa: You are answering it really well, you have got all my attention with such detailed understanding.
28/12/23, 10:33 AM - +263 77 822 9060: The third project is African Schools Education Reform Mission. 
This project focuses more on the student presenting opportunities to different students from different schools thus the project goes international . The students are to present or educate the owner of the school/s on Edoofa and the opportunities it has to give to students once the principal or headmaster is convinced the students then sets up a video/call for both parties and the networking system expands for Edoofa.
28/12/23, 10:34 AM - +263 77 822 9060: In all these projects the students get credit earnings
28/12/23, 10:40 AM - Saloni Edoofa: This is absolutely marvelous Tatenda, you have shared such an in-depth understanding that is beyond appreciation🥳🥺🫱🏻‍🫲🏼
28/12/23, 11:03 AM - Saloni Edoofa: As we wrap up today's session, I'm eager to reconnect with you tomorrow during our EWYL Group meeting from 09:00-10:00 AM! 🌟 Anticipate another engaging and fruitful session. I'm excited about what we'll achieve together. See you there

2/1/24, 9:27 AM - Saloni Edoofa: That is spectacular, I like how specific you are and Tatenda I promise you to contribute as much as possible from my end beyond being your mentor🫶🏻
2/1/24, 9:27 AM - Saloni Edoofa: Coming back to the session, I will start by explaining the projects in detail. I am sharing an audio file with you.

2/1/24, 10:02 AM - +263 77 822 9060: I've learned that the project that mostly uses a LinkedIn account is the Corporate Alliances projects . The account helps one identify the different companies to know about according to the business one may be interested in

2/1/24, 10:09 AM - Saloni Edoofa: Great, we will discuss that tomorrow in our session.
