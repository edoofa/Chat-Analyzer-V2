29/12/23, 9:50 AM - Saloni Edoofa: Hello, our proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. 
First off, I just want to wish you a massive congratulations on getting into the Edoofa scholarship program and a very warm welcome to the Earn While You Learn Program.
My name is SALONI. I would like to share that I will be your mentor for the Earn While You Learn Program, and together we will be undertaking this learning experience. Getting an opportunity to study abroad on a scholarship and to work on your skill set to be employment-ready, is something that any ambitious child would dream of. I hope that in a couple of years/ you’ll be able to agree with me that these are the best years of your life.


I believe good mentors are passionate about helping and developing their mentees and receive their rewards not in the form of money or other payback, but in seeing the people they have helped grow and become successful. As your mentor, my role will be to use my experience and knowledge to give you advice, support, and answer any questions you may have, and ensure/ that you are growing and developing with each discussion we have.
29/12/23, 9:50 AM - Saloni Edoofa: Let me introduce myself: My name is Saloni and I have a lot of interest in Economics. I like to relate global and social eye-openers to our daily lives and how they can impact us. Furthermore, my interest is drawn toward painting and dancing. I enjoy interacting with young minds, and it brings me great satisfaction to see how diligent and focused young students are about their goals in life, whether personal or professional. I like kids who are curious to learn and are excited to add different skills to their knowledge each day. I believe that a student can achieve any goal through discipline and commitment. If you have the target set in your mind, no one can stop you from living your dreams and attaining greater heights. I wish you all the very best for this journey and I believe that together we can reach up the ladder and climb higher summits.
29/12/23, 12:54 PM - +267 74 197 595: Waal thank you

Honestly, some targets seemed achievable, but I always kept a few that made me thrive beyond my boundaries to achieve them.
