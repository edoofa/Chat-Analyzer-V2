29/12/23, 2:37 PM - +263 73 736 4250: Ok ma'am
29/12/23, 2:38 PM - Saloni Edoofa: You know when I was a student and till now, I make agendas on what I wish to achieve in life this year, and how I can transform it for the betterment of not just myself, but my family and the people around me. Honestly, some targets seemed achievable, but I always kept a few that made me thrive beyond my boundaries to achieve them.
I, as your wellwisher and companion, wish you that you also push yourself and make the most of the opportunities that are coming your way starting from the EWYL Program that offers you a chance to *stand on your own feet*. Next year, _we will be a few months away from our flight to India_✈️, and I want to see you living a journey till that time that is filled with *hard work and dedication*. I have personally curated this message from the bottom of my heart to wish you a very *Happy New Year, 2024* 🫶🏻

29/12/23, 2:39 PM - +263 73 736 4250: My long-term goals include that of being a successful well known lawyer who is known for e truth. I just don't want to be someone who is only successful at a family level but not yet giving back to the society not having any positive impact in the society. Im looking forward to being that one person on which, when my name is called upon people smile because i will be there to change the community in a very positive way hence i just want to be someone who gives a strong positive impact in the society and even a country at large.
As for this EWYL program im wishing to do it whole heartedly n most of all earn much money so as to help my mother financially through my higher education
