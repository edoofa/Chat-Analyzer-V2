Before connecting with you today, I was given the responsibility for your application which I reviewed along with gathering feedback about you from your counselor and the admissions team. Some key aspects of your application, particularly *your desire* to study abroad, were highlighted. In my long-standing career, working with young motivated students who have a vision of *collective growth* has always been my interest. I am certain that working with you will undoubtedly be a *rewarding experience* as well.
29/12/23, 2:16 PM - +263 77 707 4506: Yah I hope so and hope working with you will be a life time opportunity
29/12/23, 2:23 PM - Saloni Edoofa: So Kelvin, I would like to begin this journey by knowing you beyond the _Statement of Purpose._ Can you share with me what are your long-term goals and how do you think this EWYL Program will help you in achieving them?
29/12/23, 2:38 PM - +263 77 707 4506: I'm working towards achieving my long-term goals, which include studying software engineering and working at one of the best tech company. I'm taking steps every day to make progress towards achieving these goals, and I'm excited about the future and I hope EWYL program can help me in preparing and providing me with basic knowledge about my field
29/12/23, 2:40 PM - Saloni Edoofa: You know when I was a student and till now, I make agendas on what I wish to achieve in life this year, and how I can transform it for the betterment of not just myself, but my family and the people around me. Honestly, some targets seemed achievable, but I always kept a few that made me thrive beyond my boundaries to achieve them.
I, as your wellwisher and companion, wish you that you also push yourself and make the most of the opportunities that are coming your way starting from the EWYL Program that offers you a chance to *stand on your own feet*. Next year, _we will be a few months away from our flight to India_✈️, and I want to see you living a journey till that time that is filled with *hard work and dedication*. I have personally curated this message from the bottom of my heart to wish you a very *Happy New Year, 2024* 🫶🏻

2/1/24, 1:28 PM - Saloni Edoofa: _Good day to each wonderful member of our group_!

As we embark on this new year, I want to extend my heartfelt wishes for a joyous *NEW YEAR 2024*🌟 filled with good health, peace, success, thrilling adventures, and a remarkable academic journey that awaits you🫶🏻.

I am genuinely excited to _hear about your New Year celebrations and any resolutions you've set for yourself_. Whether they involve personal growth, academic achievements, or new experiences, I am eager to support and celebrate your journey throughout the year🎯.
2/1/24, 1:28 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Our sessions this week, scheduled from *Tuesday to Friday*, will be the perfect opportunity to share your stories, aspirations, and plans for the year. The sessions will run from *01:30-02:30 PM*. Your active participation will make our discussions more enriching and enjoyable.

If, for any reason, you won't be able to attend a session, kindly let me know in advance.
2/1/24, 1:40 PM - +263 77 707 4506: OK let's begin the session
2/1/24, 1:46 PM - Saloni Edoofa: I am genuinely excited to _hear about your New Year celebrations and any resolutions you've set for yourself_.
2/1/24, 1:46 PM - +263 77 707 4506: My new year celebration where fine and for this year I have some gools that I have set for myself and one of them is to extend my knowledge about programming

2/1/24, 1:52 PM - +263 77 707 4506: OK I'm so happy to hear that you are willing to help me achieve my gool
2/1/24, 1:58 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Kelvin, I am so happy to hear about your long-term goals!

Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
2/1/24, 1:59 PM - +263 77 707 4506: No
2/1/24, 2:03 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
2/1/24, 2:04 PM - Saloni Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
2/1/24, 2:07 PM - +263 77 707 4506: OK now I understand
2/1/24, 2:18 PM - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
2/1/24, 2:21 PM - +263 77 707 4506: Wow that nice I think if I work hard with you I can manage to reach such level
2/1/24, 3:36 PM - Saloni Edoofa: I am really happy with the progress we have made so far and I hope that we take many steps ahead toward a fruitful session tomorrow.
Hoping to see you with the same zeal and enthusiasm *tomorrow* at your given time slot (01:30-02:30 PM) here in your EWYL Group.
