For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts, I will explain to you it in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them.

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
28/12/23, 1:47 PM - +263 78 811 4776: Yes we may start
28/12/23, 2:09 PM - Dev Edoofa: <Media omitted>
28/12/23, 2:10 PM - +263 78 811 4776: I'm done
28/12/23, 2:11 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
28/12/23, 2:11 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
28/12/23, 2:13 PM - +263 78 811 4776: Yes they are clear you may continue please
28/12/23, 2:18 PM - Dev Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
28/12/23, 2:18 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
28/12/23, 2:20 PM - +263 78 811 4776: Yes I am following
28/12/23, 2:21 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
28/12/23, 2:21 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
28/12/23, 2:22 PM - +263 78 811 4776: Yes they are
28/12/23, 2:25 PM - Dev Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
28/12/23, 2:25 PM - +263 78 811 4776: Yes we may start
28/12/23, 2:33 PM - Dev Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
28/12/23, 2:33 PM - Dev Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding you are ready, shall we start with our discussion with me individually? 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
28/12/23, 2:35 PM - +263 78 811 4776: Yes you may move on
28/12/23, 2:37 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students*

The fourth video is about the Statement of Purpose (SOP). The most important step towards securing a good scholarship is to write the Statement of Purpose but to know why it is important, watching this video will clear your doubts and questions.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftsGGGBYMrs&feature=youtu.be
28/12/23, 2:38 PM - Dev Edoofa: Tinotenda, I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection. 

Please go through the 4 videos, our next session will be scheduled after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarize your understanding.

2/1/24, 12:30 PM - +263 78 811 4776: *2. My understanding of UI/UX and its usage  in today's digital world are*

In digital design, user interface (UI) refers to the interactivity, look, and feel of a product screen or web page, while user experience (UX) covers a user’s overall experience with the product or website.

To create engaging UI, designers consider these elements Page layout, Color scheme and font selection, interactive elements and Wireframe and prototype fidelity

The UX design process involves market research, wireframe development, prototype testing, and cross-functional collaboration.

The usage of UI/ UX

Increased Conversion Rates:Improved user experience which leads to increased user satisfaction and engagement rates. 

Higher Rate of User Growth:A core aspect of UI/UX design is attending to the needs of target users. With such a foundational principle, digital products are guaranteed to pique the interests of more and more customers every year.

Increased In-House Productivity:
A streamlined and well-designed website or application can have a positive impact on a company’s staff. Intuitive UI/UX designs in websites and apps help create smooth workflows for employees.

Search Engine Optimization Boost:
As stated before UI/UX design is a central aspect of Google’s Core Web Vital. Investing in the right UI/UX design practices can certainly help websites improve their SERP rankings.
2/1/24, 12:56 PM - +263 78 811 4776: *3.My understanding of the OSI model are*

OSI stands for Open System Interconnection is a reference model that describes how information from a software application in one computer moves through a physical medium to the software application in another computer.

The 7 layers of the OSI model are Physical Layer, Data-Link Layer, Network Layer, Transport Layer, Session Layer, Presentation Layer, Application Layer

Physical Layer 's main functionality is to transmit the individual bits from one node to another node.It is the lowest layer of the OSI model.It also establishes, maintains and deactivates the physical connection.
It specifies the mechanical, electrical and procedural network interface specifications.

Data-Link layer is responsible for the error-free transfer of data frames.It defines the format of the data on the network.It provides a reliable and efficient communication between two or more devices.
It is mainly responsible for the unique identification of each device that resides on a local network.
It contains two sub-layers which are the Logical Link control layer, and the Media Access control layer. The Logical Link control layer is responsible for transferring the packets to the Network layer of the receiver that is receiving, Media Access control layer is used for transferring the packets over the network.

Network Layer is a layer 3 that manages device addressing, tracks the location of devices on the network. It determines the best path to move data from source to the destination based on the network conditions, the priority of service, and other factors. Routers are the layer 3 devices, they are specified in this layer and used to provide the routing services within an internetwork.

Transport Layer is a Layer 4 ensures that messages are transmitted in the order in which they are sent and there is no duplication of data.
The main responsibility of the transport layer is to transfer the data completely. It receives the data from the upper layer and converts them into smaller units known as segments.The two protocols used in it are transmission control protocol an user datagram protocol.

Session layer is used to establish, maintain and synchronizes the interaction between communicating devices.Session layer acts as a dialog controller that creates a dialog between two processes or we can say that it allows the communication between two processes which can be either half-duplex or full-duplex.

Presentation layer is mainly concerned with the syntax and semantics of the information exchanged between the two systems.It acts as a data translator for a network.
This layer is a part of the operating system that converts the data from one presentation format to another format.The Presentation layer is also known as the syntax layer.It deals with translation, encryption and compression of data.

Application layer serves as a window for users and application processes to access network service. It handles issues such as network transparency, resource allocation, etc.
An application layer is not an application, but it performs the application layer functions. This layer provides the network services to the end-users.
2/1/24, 1:16 PM - +263 78 811 4776: *4.My understanding about programming and programming languages and which languages are most widely used in today's applications and why?*

Computer programming or coding is the composition of sequences of instructions, called programs, that computers can follow to perform tasks. It involves designing and implementing algorithms, step-by-step specifications of procedures, by writing code in one or more programming languages.

A programming language is a computer language that is used by programmers (developers) to communicate with computers. It is a set of instructions written in any specific language ( C, C++, Java, Python) to perform a specific task.

Python is the most used language in the world now because of its nature too Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence and also because of its libraries collections. Python is versatile. Python is a very versatile and highly-utilized language. Python's versatility has led it to be used for everything from basic web development to complex AI systems and embedded projects. Furthermore, Python has the ability to act as a "glue" code that connects different programming components together to interact and run on every operating system.  



The second language is Javascript  
​
One of the most used programming languages by developers in 2020, as per GitHub, will be Javascript. It is being increasingly used in the game development sector and Internet of Things (IoT). It is also one of the core existing technologies of the web, along with HTML and CSS.
 
Features of Javascript:
Interpreted and light-weighted programming language
Object-oriented computer programming language, that is commonly used for the purpose of creating interactive effects within the internet browsers
Plays a significant role in front-end development for popular websites such as YouTube, Facebook, Google, Wikipedia, and Amazon.
Optional static typing features to the language software can be added by using Typescript which is a superset of JavaScript
 
Advantages of Javascript:
Speed-driven
Simple to use
Interoperable
Adaptable to rich interfaces
Extended functionalities
 
Disadvantages of Javascript:
Security issues from the client’s side
Security threat for client-side scripts
Browser support interpretations

The third one is C, C is a multi-paradigm, procedural language. It supports structured programming, meaning it’s a low-level language that doesn’t require a lot of runtime to support. This makes C a great language for operating systems, hardware drivers, and kernel-level software.

An may more like HTML, CSS, PHP and SQL
2/1/24, 1:28 PM - +263 78 811 4776: *5.The difference between compilers and intepreters*

A Compiler is a translator which takes input i.e., High-Level Language, and produces an output of low-level language i.e. machine or assembly language. The work of a Compiler is to transform the codes written in the programming language into machine code (format of 0s and 1s) so that computers can understand. Whilst

An Interpreter is a program that translates a programming language into a comprehensible language. The interpreter converts high-level language to an intermediate language. It contains pre-compiled code, source code, etc.

The compiler saves the Machine Language in form of Machine Code on disks.

The Interpreter does not save the Machine Language.

Compiled codes run faster than Interpreter.

Interpreted codes run slower than Compiler.

The compiler generates an output in the form of (.exe).

The interpreter does not generate any output.

The compiler can see code upfront which helps in running the code faster because of performing Optimization.

The Interpreter works by line working of Code, that’s why Optimization is a little slower compared to Compilers.

CPU utilization is more in the case of a Compiler.

CPU utilization is less in the case of a Interpreter.

Compilers more often take a large amount of time for analyzing the source code.

In comparison, Interpreters take less time for analyzing the source code

Execution of the program takes place only after the whole program is compiled. In Compiler

Execution of the program happens after every line is checked or evaluated.In Interpreter

C, C++, C#, etc are programming languages that are compiler-based.

Whilst, Python, Ruby, Perl, SNOBOL, MATLAB, etc are programming languages that are interpreter-based.
