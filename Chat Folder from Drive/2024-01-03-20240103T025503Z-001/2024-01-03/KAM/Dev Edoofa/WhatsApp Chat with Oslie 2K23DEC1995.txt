28/12/23, 8:05 AM - +263 77 453 2562: But the issue here is 1.Oslie is in boarding school and from the 8th of January she will be going back to school and phones are not allowed.
Oslie is yet to register for Alevel examinations and they usually do so around March so I don't know how she can proceed with the EWYL program
28/12/23, 8:15 AM - Dev Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Oslie!

In regards to her availability for the EWYL program, we have taken this situation into our notice and will get back to you with a viable solution. And, as for the registration of A- level examination, you can provide the letter of recommendation from the school which is readily available when asked for.
I hope I was able to clear your doubts?
