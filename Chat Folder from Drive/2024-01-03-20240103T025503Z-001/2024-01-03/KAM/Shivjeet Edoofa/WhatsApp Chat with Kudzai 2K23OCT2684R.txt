29/12/23, 4:05 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon dear parents and Kudzai

I hope this message finds you well and blessed. It has been a while since the last time we were connected with each other. As I was occupied with university obligations and Christmas preparations, I would like to take this opportunity to inquire how you are doing today?
29/12/23, 4:22 PM - +263 77 346 1535: Welcome back sir.  It is good that we are reconnecting. We are all well this side and looking forward to a new year ahead. How are you there?
29/12/23, 4:37 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am great, thank you for asking. If you are ready shall we now proceed with the session for the admission process?
29/12/23, 4:57 PM - +263 77 346 1535: Yes please, let us proceed
29/12/23, 5:01 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Since you are active now, I wanted to know if you were able to recall our past discussions about the admission process so that we can proceed with the session smoothly?
29/12/23, 5:08 PM - +263 77 346 1535: Yes I remember. We talked about the Edoofa secure plan where you highlighted how we could save money for admission. The discussion ended with my question on the monthly $150 that has to be deposited
29/12/23, 6:05 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: That's great. Now that you have all the information, I want you to take some time and discuss the financial security plan with your family members. Help them understand its importance and details. Once you're done, we can reconnect, have a discussion, and address any queries you may have. After resolving your concerns, I'll guide you through starting your financial security plan. 

While most students can discuss this with their parents the same day, I understand everyone is different. Could you let me know by when you think you'll have the discussion with your parents? This way, we can schedule our next session accordingly.
29/12/23, 6:20 PM - +263 78 727 2005: We already had a brief discussion pertaining the topic but we could revisit it and finalize it today. I am definite that by tomorrow we can continue to have our session.
29/12/23, 6:27 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know.  We shall connect tomorrow at 3:00 PM Tomorrow.
29/12/23, 6:28 PM - +263 78 727 2005: Will be there!
