19/12/23, 7:11 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening!

I hope you are doing well and blessed today. Please excuse me for the late reply. I was occupied with a university official today. May I know if you are available to proceed with our session?
19/12/23, 7:19 PM - +263 78 948 9559: Good evening to you too yes lam ready
19/12/23, 7:36 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. I did go through your responses and I can see you did understand all the videos. 

*Video 1: Important Message for Enrolled Students*

The first video underscores the importance of two crucial qualities: open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions. Edoofa's vision for its students is to foster success in their careers, and promote responsibility, and independence. A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.
19/12/23, 7:37 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s Vision for You*

Edoofa's vision for its students is to provide them with employment opportunities and the skills necessary to become future leaders. The program places students above other candidates by investing significant time and effort into finding reputable, education-focused institutions rather than solely business-oriented ones.
19/12/23, 7:37 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

In the third video, it is highlighted that Edoofa's founders have dedicated over a decade to meticulously identifying reputable educational institutions. Students are advised to cultivate the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to excel in the job market. All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to student's career goals.
19/12/23, 7:37 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools. It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.
19/12/23, 7:37 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: In summary, these videos emphasize the significance of qualities such as open-mindedness, following instructions, and cooperation. Edoofa's vision is to empower students for successful careers and leadership roles by carefully selecting educational institutions. The SOP is a vital tool for effective communication and admission success. 

I hope you agree with all of this and were able to understand these by watching the four videos?
19/12/23, 7:39 PM - +263 78 948 9559: l agree and l was able to understand
19/12/23, 7:53 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Brilliant, Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.
19/12/23, 7:53 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by Tomorrow 5:30 PM.
19/12/23, 7:53 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

20/12/23, 5:14 PM - +263 78 948 9559: 2.Rights are things that a person is entitled to  for example one can have the right to vote and violating someone's rights is considered a serious offense whilst duties are things that a person is obligated to do , duties are responsibilities for example one is obligated to pay tax.  On the other hand human rights are the basic rights and freedoms that all people are entitled to regardless of their nationality and where they come from these rights include the right to food ,human rights are fundamental and inalienable ,in other words they cannot be restricted or to be taken away whilst civil rights on the other hand are the rights and freedoms  that people have in relation to the government and society . In other words civil rights are specific to a particular country and civil rights are more specific and also civil rights can be changed or to be limited by the government. Right to vote is an example of civil rights and they vary from country to country unlike human rights that are universal.
20/12/23, 5:15 PM - +263 78 948 9559: 3. A prosecutor is a legal professional who represents the government in criminal cases .In other words a prosecutor works for the government .A prosecutor's job is to bring criminal charges against against people who are suspected of committing crimes .In other words a prosecutor is the one who decides whether to charge someone with a crime and then prosecutes them in court.This can involve gathering evidence and interviewing witnesses and arguing the case in front of the judge or the jury.  A prosecutor's job is to seek justice not to win a case at all costs. On the other hand an attorney is a legal professional who can represent clients in both civil and criminal cases unlike a prosecutor who deals with criminal cases.An attorney may also be called a lawyer or a counsel. A lawyer or an attorney's job is to win the case at any cost . An attorney will be speaking on behalf of the client with the help of evidence gathered
20/12/23, 5:15 PM - +263 78 948 9559: 4.Of the branches of   law lam more interested in civil law . Civil law is  quite different from criminal law . lam more interested in  civil law as it covers a wide range of non criminal disputes which include contract disputes, property disputes , personal injury claims and many more. They are many reasons as to why lam more interested in civil law and the reasons include ,civil law  typically offers a great chance of monetary compensation compared to criminal law and by any chance if l win a   civil case you might end up being awarded with money to compensate for your losses , secondly civil cases are less time consuming as they are resolved faster compared to criminal cases , thirdly civil cases are typically less emotional draining comparing with criminal cases and as for me l do not like  to be emotionally drained  with cases
20/12/23, 5:15 PM - +263 78 948 9559: 5.There are a few and essential skills that are of paramount importance for one to be a successful lawyer and fortunately l possess those skills   . Firstly l have good communication skills because a lawyer has to be a good communicartor both verbally and in writing , for instance  if a lawyer has all the evidence needed but cannot  communicate well the chances of winning a case becomes low . Furthermore l possess the skills of problem solving and critical thinking , l think this skill is important as a lawyer sometimes deals with tricky cases and inorder to win the case one has to be a critical thinker and l also have the ability to think out of the box . In addition l also have strong research skills and l can even work under pressure and also lam a very organized person. Most importantly l have a passion for justice and lam committed in helping others.

20/12/23, 6:07 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, dear parents and Praise!

I hope you are doing well today. I was not able to connect with you earlier as it was past my available hours at the moment. I would like to let you know that our available hours daily will be from 6:00 pm to 9:00 pm every day for this session. With that said may I know if you are now ready to proceed with the session?
20/12/23, 6:08 PM - +263 78 948 9559: Yes lam ready
20/12/23, 6:40 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for providing the documents. With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey. we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*.
20/12/23, 6:41 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: However, before we do the same, I was going through your scholarship application file and noticed that you are supposed to make the payment of your remaining part of Edoofa Enrollment fee before 20th December 2023. Hence, I thought of sharing a gentle reminder with you and trying to understand how your preparation has been so far? Have you been able to align your preparations in the right direction?
20/12/23, 6:50 PM - +263 77 274 5128: Greetings to you
My apology we got our salary late today.. Tomorrow will deposit the balance
20/12/23, 7:12 PM - +263 77 274 5128: <Media omitted>
20/12/23, 7:14 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the clarification with me. Please allow me to clarify this and come back to you very shortly.
20/12/23, 7:31 PM - +263 77 274 5128: Noted
20/12/23, 7:49 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I would like to let you know that, the statement is correct and there was a clerical error on our end.
20/12/23, 7:53 PM - +263 77 274 5128: Noted with thanks
20/12/23, 8:04 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: In the meantime, let us move forward with our discussion. To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is BA LLB and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2025. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
20/12/23, 8:07 PM - +263 78 948 9559: Yes that is accurate
20/12/23, 8:08 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. Based on our experience of over 14 years and having assisted over 5000 students from different countries, we have realized that financial planning is the most important factor when a student plans for his/her higher education abroad.
20/12/23, 8:08 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am sure that you must be aware that 20-30% of students who are admitted into universities abroad are unable to fulfill their dream and come to India due to a lack of financial planning. The funds needed for booking flights, accommodation, and covering living expenses after arrival often become overwhelming, leading to the decision to defer their admission for a year. This, in turn, creates a gap in the child's education.
20/12/23, 8:08 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: To assist both students and parents in this regard, Edoofa Management has designed a Financial Secure Plan that aims to help you prepare for your higher educational finances without experiencing stress or last-minute rushes. I believe you must be wondering about the details of the same plan and how it helps the parents?
20/12/23, 8:10 PM - +263 78 948 9559: Yes lam
20/12/23, 8:19 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Edoofa Secure Plan is important for parents who have children joining the university for tertiary education in the next one to two years for several reasons:

*Financial Preparedness:* The Edoofa Secure plan helps parents prepare financially for the costs after the Scholarship being offered so that they are not caught off guard.

*Reduced Financial Stress:* Having the Edoofa Secure Plan in place can significantly reduce the financial stress on you as parents when your child is about to enter university. Knowing that there is a dedicated fund for education expenses provides peace of mind.

*Avoiding Debt*: Without proper savings, some parents may resort to taking out loans or accumulating credit card debt to cover their child's education costs. This Educational savings plan helps avoid the burden of debt and high-interest payments.

*Compound Interest:* By starting to save early and consistently contributing to the savings plan, parents can take advantage of compound interest, which can significantly increase the amount available for education expenses.

*Flexibility and Control:* The Edoofa Secure savings plans allow parents to have greater control over their finances and how they allocate funds for their child's education. They can choose investment options that align with their risk tolerance and financial goals.
20/12/23, 8:19 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Encouraging Responsibility*: Involving your child in the process of saving for their education teaches them financial responsibility and the value of higher education. It also motivates them to outperform in Academics.

*Adapting to Unexpected Changes*: Life is full of surprises, and circumstances can change especially when there are political reforms changing each day impacting the Local Currency. Having an Edoofa Secure Plan allows parents to adapt to unexpected changes in their financial situation while still prioritizing their child's education.

*Peace of Mind:* Overall, having the Edoofa Secure plan provides parents with peace of mind, knowing that they are actively planning for their child's future and increasing the likelihood of providing them with a solid education.
20/12/23, 8:19 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, when you go through all the above benefits, I am sure you can see that the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan is an important financial tool for parents/students who are supposed to enter the university soon. 

It helps ensure that the financial aspect of tertiary education is well-managed, reduces stress, and allows parents to provide the best opportunities for their children without resorting to debt or financial hardship. Isn't this something you and your family also wish to have?
20/12/23, 8:37 PM - +263 78 948 9559: Yes we do wish to have that
20/12/23, 8:54 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for being online and proceeding with the session with me for today. As my available hours are coming to an end I am closing our session for now and let us continue tomorrow. Have a great day and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
20/12/23, 9:01 PM - +263 78 948 9559: Noted with thanks
21/12/23, 6:37 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening, dear parents and Praise!

I hope this message finds you well and blessed. May I know if you are currently available so that we can proceed with the session for your admission process?
21/12/23, 6:39 PM - +263 78 948 9559: Yes lam available
21/12/23, 7:07 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. May I know if you were able to go through the above points?
21/12/23, 7:09 PM - +263 78 948 9559: Yes l went through them
21/12/23, 7:19 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through the above points, do you want me to help you understand how the Edoofa Secure Plan works?
21/12/23, 7:20 PM - +263 78 948 9559: Yes please
21/12/23, 7:58 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, as you are aware, we are currently in December 2023, and we have a good 20-21 months to plan for your finances before you start your university education in 2025.
21/12/23, 8:00 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: During the counseling session, you were informed that at Edoofa, we guarantee a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship on the tuition fees. Hence, the cost of education, including food and accommodation after the scholarship, would be between $1200-$1800, and it could be even less. Not more than that.
21/12/23, 8:02 PM - +263 78 948 9559: That is well noted
21/12/23, 8:16 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: This means that if you can save $150 per month for the next 20 months, you will be able to save $3000. This amount is more than enough for the first year of university fees, including tuition fees (if any), food, and accommodation. I hope you agree with this?
21/12/23, 8:17 PM - +263 78 948 9559: Yes l do agree
21/12/23, 8:19 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Right, this means that by the time you would be in India, you would have already saved the $3000 that will cover the first-year fee.
21/12/23, 8:19 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, in these next 20 months, I am sure you would also be engaged in the EWYL program, and if you secure a minimum of $1000 in 20 months, that means the fees for 1.5 years are already secured.
21/12/23, 8:19 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, for a 3-year course, if we follow the same approach for the remaining 1.5 years, the educational journey for the student and the financial journey for the parent will be easy and smooth. I believe you must be able to see this perspective?
21/12/23, 8:28 PM - +263 78 948 9559: l can see that
21/12/23, 8:59 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for being online and proceeding with the session with me for today. As my available hours are coming to an end I am closing our session for now and let us continue tomorrow properly. Have a great day and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
21/12/23, 9:03 PM - +263 78 948 9559: Thank you
28/12/23, 6:02 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon!

As it has been a while. May I know how are you doing today?
28/12/23, 6:48 PM - +263 78 948 9559: Iam doing just fine and you <This message was edited>
28/12/23, 8:01 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. May I know if you are now ready to proceed with the session for the admisson process?
28/12/23, 8:02 PM - +263 78 948 9559: Yes lam ready
28/12/23, 8:05 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: If you see the bigger picture, you will realize that the reason is quite simple. Upon the completion of the 10 installments, the Edoofa Admissions team will initiate the Child’s Admission Process by applying early to the universities to secure their scholarship and their university seat.
28/12/23, 8:05 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Reserving seats earlier increases the chances of obtaining a maximum scholarship. A higher scholarship means lower fees, and by securing the seat, you will be entitled to pay the fees as per the old fee structure of the university, not the new one implemented in January 2025. Furthermore, when applying to the universities, you will receive an offer letter or a letter of intent detailing the fees, scholarship, and registration fee.
28/12/23, 8:05 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: As explained during the enrollment process, the registration fee is a portion of your first-year university fee, paid to reserve the seat. It ranges from $500-$1000 and is not an additional fee. 

From the $1500 you saved with Edoofa, the registration fee will be paid to the university, securing the seat. For instance, if the registration fee is $1000, Edoofa will pay $1000 from the $1500 saved in 10 months. The updated balance with Edoofa will be $500, which will be paid to the university upon your arrival in India.
28/12/23, 8:05 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: This eases the financial burden on the parent, as there is no immediate payment required upon the student's arrival. The $500 saved will cover the remaining fees for the semester/year, as specified in the offer letter from the university. What are your thoughts on this?
28/12/23, 8:08 PM - +263 78 948 9559: I think that is really great and l find it helpful
28/12/23, 8:20 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to see that we are together so far. With this plan for the next 10 months, I am sure you must be wondering what will happen in the next 10 months, considering you have already secured your scholarship seat with the university due to your hard work in the first 10 months. Is my understanding correct?
28/12/23, 8:24 PM - +263 78 948 9559: Yes
28/12/23, 8:27 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let me help you with that as well. In the 11th month, you will be guided to open an FBC Mastercard bank account in Zimbabwe with a deposit of $150. The reason for this is that when you apply for your student Visa, the Embassy asks for a Bank Statement, and this account will serve that purpose.
28/12/23, 8:27 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: We understand it might be expensive if you deposit another $1500 for the remaining 10 months in FB  Bank Zimbabwe, so to avoid the same challenges, we have designed the plan accordingly. You will only be depositing for the 11th, 12th, 13th, and 14th month, which is 4 months.
28/12/23, 8:27 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once the 4 months are completed, our Department of Student Welfare (DSW) team will assist you with your visa process. The bank statement will act as one of the required documents, and once you receive the visa, you can withdraw the amount from FBC and book the flight ticket. This will help you utilize the money as well. How does it sound?
28/12/23, 8:29 PM - +263 78 948 9559: It sounds good
28/12/23, 8:33 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, from the 16th Month till the 20th month, considering it is a 6-month window, you can again continue depositing the money ($150) with Edoofa which can be used in the fee as and when required or you can decide to save this $900 of these 6 months with you as well. This is something which you are free to choose. I hope you have understood the financial secure plan now?
28/12/23, 8:35 PM - +263 78 948 9559: Yes l have understood
28/12/23, 9:12 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for being online and proceeding with the session with me for today. As much as I wanted to proceed with the session my available hours are coming to an end I am closing our session for now and let us continue tomorrow properly again. Have a great day and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
29/12/23, 6:13 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening!

I hope you are doing well today. May I know if you are currently available to proceed with the session for the admission process?
29/12/23, 6:38 PM - +263 78 948 9559: Yes lam available
29/12/23, 6:38 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: That's great. Now that you have all the information, I want you to take some time and discuss the financial security plan with your family members. Help them understand its importance and details. Once you're done, we can reconnect, have a discussion, and address any queries you may have. After resolving your concerns, I'll guide you through starting your financial security plan. 

While most students can discuss this with their parents the same day, I understand everyone is different. Could you let me know by when you think you'll have the discussion with your parents? This way, we can schedule our next session accordingly.
29/12/23, 7:44 PM - +263 78 948 9559: By tomorrow we will be done
29/12/23, 7:49 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: That's perfectly fine. In that case, we will conclude today's conversation, and I will connect with you on the 2nd of January to resume our discussion. In the meantime, I hope you'll have a detailed discussion with your family and jot down any questions or thoughts you have regarding the Financial Secure plan.

Wishing you a good day ahead, and please extend our regards to your family.

2/1/24, 8:19 PM - +263 78 948 9559: Yes l managed to do that
2/1/24, 8:19 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Could you please let me know how was the descussion?
2/1/24, 8:20 PM - +263 77 274 5128: Greetings to you
2/1/24, 8:39 PM - +263 77 274 5128: It's Praise 's mother
I have been following the discussion and
How the secure plan works.

We found it as a good idea . But looking at our monthly earnings we may find it difficult to save 150us every month considering our monthly bills.......we  had already started planning for Praise 's tertiary needs but engaging in poultry project. So that we will make profits out of it reducing burden of relying on salary which is not enough to sustain the family.
2/1/24, 9:25 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: As my available hours are coming to an end. I would like to let you know that I am now closing my session for today and let us proceed with the session tomorrow. Have a great night and my warm regards to your lovely family.
