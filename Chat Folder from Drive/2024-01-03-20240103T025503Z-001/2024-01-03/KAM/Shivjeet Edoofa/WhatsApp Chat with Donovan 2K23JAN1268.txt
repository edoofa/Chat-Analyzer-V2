I hope you are doing well and I wish you a Blessed Happy New Year. Over the past couple of days I have been trying to reach you in order to proceed with our session for your admission process. However, it seems that all my efforts are in vain. As we wait for your response all of your peers have started or commenced their admission process. I have also noticed that you have seen my messages as well.
