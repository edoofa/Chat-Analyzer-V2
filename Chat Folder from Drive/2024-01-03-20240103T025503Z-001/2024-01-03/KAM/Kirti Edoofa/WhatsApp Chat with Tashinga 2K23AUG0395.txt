28/12/23, 5:51 PM - +27 79 803 5710: Good evening Kirti. I pray you are well. May we please have the Money order so that we can make the first payment for the registration fees. Thank you
28/12/23, 6:19 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, Parents and Tashinga.

I hope you are doing well. I just received an update from the accounts team. Regarding the order, you must be aware that there is a monthly account transaction limit for Mama Money. I just checked with the accounts team and they mentioned that the Mama Money's Limit for this month has been reached due to a higher number of students joining the program from South Africa. <This message was edited>
