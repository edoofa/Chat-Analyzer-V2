I hope you are doing well and I find you in high spirits. After our previous discussion, I am sure you and your family were filled with anticipation regarding the opportunity presented by Galgotias University. 

Receiving the university's offer letter is indeed a significant milestone, and I can imagine the excitement that must have accompanied the anticipation of this moment.

Looking forward, I would like to enquire if you and your family had an opportunity to review and discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University as a collective?
18/12/23, 4:07 PM - +260 771023019: Yes we did just wondering if we have to make the payments before the error is corrected or?

18/12/23, 4:15 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Dear, The error is already shared with the university and I am sure they must have update the same in their records. If you need the revised letter, I can request the same from the team. Hence, the payment needs to be done as per the payment plan shared with you please.
