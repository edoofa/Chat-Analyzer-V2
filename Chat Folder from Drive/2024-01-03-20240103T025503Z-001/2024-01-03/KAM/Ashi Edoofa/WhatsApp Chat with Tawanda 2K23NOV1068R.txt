I trust this message finds you in good health. In our recent conversation, you mentioned your plan to complete the payment by the 31st of December. Accordingly, I shared this update with the university officials.
30/12/23, 2:29 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Considering that this time of year is marked as the festive season, the university officials recommended that you complete the payment either a day before or early on Sunday. This precautionary measure aims to ensure that you do not encounter unexpected challenges. By doing so, you will have a backup day, minimizing the risk of any issues and safeguarding your scholarship.
30/12/23, 2:29 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Once you make the payment for your fee, as you always do, please remember to share the payment receipt with us. This will enable us to confirm the payment in a timely manner. 

Kindly inform me once you have taken note of this message. If you have any concerns or need further assistance, feel free to reach out.
