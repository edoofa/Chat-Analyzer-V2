20/12/23, 1:39 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Greetings, dear parent and my dear student!

I would like to share an update with you: starting today, I will no longer be serving as your admission officer. I wanted to inform you that Ms. Ashi will be taking over from now on, and she will be reaching out to you very soon.

Over the past 12 months, I have had the privilege of serving as the admission officer for you and many other students. It has been a great experience getting to know the potential of my students and spending valuable time discussing their aspirations. However, every journey has its end, and now it's time for me to embark on a new chapter.

Rest assured, the exceptional service and support you have received will continue seamlessly as Ms. Ashi, one of our accomplished admission officers, takes over your admission journey from this point forward. I wish you the very best on your journey. Goodbye, my dear student.

Yours sincerely,
Mr. Shivjeet
Admission Officer
20/12/23, 6:44 PM - +265 999 96 51 01: Thank you for being with us through out most of the admission process Mr. Shivjeet. Wishing you all the best
26/12/23, 1:56 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Dalitso ,

In light of the conversation we had earlier, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you are ready for the discussion today. I am here at the scheduled time to have a discussion about your academic journey futher. With this said, May I know if you are available for the conversation ?

I am eagerly waiting for your response.
26/12/23, 2:17 PM - +265 999 96 51 01: Good afternoon. I am available and ready to proceed with today's session
26/12/23, 2:40 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing @265999965101. Before we start our session for today, we kindly request you to share the following documents for your university application preparation:

1. A-Level Results/Letter of Recommendation/Statement of Entry (A-Level).
2. O-Level Results.
3. Identity proof (International Traveling Passport or National ID or Birth Certificate).
26/12/23, 2:51 PM - +265 999 96 51 01: <Media omitted>
26/12/23, 2:51 PM - +265 999 96 51 01: <Media omitted>
26/12/23, 2:53 PM - +265 999 96 51 01: As for the O-level results, I never wrote JCE as it was temporarily suspended by the government during my time
26/12/23, 2:58 PM - +265 888 89 92 09: The highest Malawi Government examination at Secondary (High) School is Malawi School Certificate Examination (MSCE).  This is equivalent to O- level.
26/12/23, 3:16 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the above documents with me.
26/12/23, 3:16 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Regarding the JCE Results, if you did not appear for your exams due to their cancellation, you will need to obtain a letter from your school. This letter should confirm that the JCE exams were not held, but you successfully completed your JCE, listing the subjects you studied in school. May I know if you have such a letter with you or if you will have to secure it from the school?
26/12/23, 3:18 PM - +265 999 96 51 01: We will have to secure it from the school
26/12/23, 3:29 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Sure @265999965101, Kindly contact them for the document please.
26/12/23, 3:29 PM - Ashi Edoofa: The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
26/12/23, 3:29 PM - Ashi Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
26/12/23, 3:35 PM - +265 999 96 51 01: Thank you very much for this opportunity
26/12/23, 3:36 PM - +265 999 96 51 01: May I ask when am I scheduled to start the EWYL program?
26/12/23, 3:46 PM - Ashi Edoofa: You are welcome dear, I will be assisting you regarding the EWYL journey soon.
26/12/23, 3:46 PM - Ashi Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
26/12/23, 3:46 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
26/12/23, 3:46 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
26/12/23, 4:25 PM - +265 999 96 51 01: I have gone through the benefits and we may proceed
26/12/23, 4:39 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
26/12/23, 4:39 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 1. *Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa*.

On the basis of your A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive the letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa.
26/12/23, 4:40 PM - Ashi Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means you, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing your seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioning your as a frontier person in this endeavor. <This message was edited>
26/12/23, 4:45 PM - +265 999 96 51 01: This is really a huge benefit.
26/12/23, 4:50 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 2. *Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.* 

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
26/12/23, 4:50 PM - Ashi Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
26/12/23, 4:50 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
26/12/23, 4:53 PM - +265 999 96 51 01: It is very clear and pleasing to know this ahead of time
26/12/23, 4:57 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 3.*Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $100 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $1000, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $900.
26/12/23, 4:58 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $1000 fee, you will only be required to pay $900. Once this payment is completed, the entire $1000 amount will be adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $100 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $1000. Does this explanation resonate with you?
26/12/23, 5:01 PM - +265 999 96 51 01: Yes it is clear as well
26/12/23, 5:05 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 4. *Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.* 

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
26/12/23, 5:05 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $100 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
26/12/23, 5:05 PM - Ashi Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for December 30, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $900, you'll need to make a payment of $450 on or before December 30, 2023. The remaining $450 should be paid by January 30, 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
26/12/23, 5:08 PM - +265 999 96 51 01: I understand the instructions and I'm sure my parents are clear on the same as well.
26/12/23, 5:09 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
26/12/23, 5:10 PM - +265 999 96 51 01: I do not have any queried so for. We may proceed
26/12/23, 5:15 PM - Ashi Edoofa: So, are you excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
26/12/23, 5:17 PM - +265 999 96 51 01: I am excited and ready to complete the next steps
26/12/23, 5:25 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation and with your approval, we will now proceed with the preparations for the application and submit it to the universities recommended by the academic board, tailored to your chosen course. 

Once we receive updates from the universities, we will quickly reconnect with you and share all the relevant information.
26/12/23, 5:25 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Throughout this process, please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. We are here to assist you and ensure that the higher education journey is meticulously planned and successful. 

Your peace of mind is of utmost importance to us, and we are fully dedicated to providing you with all the support you may require.
26/12/23, 5:28 PM - +265 999 96 51 01: Thank you very much and we shall be patiently waiting for the updates.
26/12/23, 5:37 PM - Ashi Edoofa: You are most welcome @265999965101,. On that note, we will be bringing our today's conversation to a close. Wish you a blessed week ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.
26/12/23, 5:41 PM - +265 999 96 51 01: Wishing you a blessed week as well.
26/12/23, 5:47 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you @265999965101
27/12/23, 10:01 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Greetings Parents and Dalitso, I hope you are doing well.
27/12/23, 10:01 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I would like to share that your JCE document is pending, Kindly share it with us please.

28/12/23, 11:57 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your response with us, I understand that you will not be able to secure the document due to the Christmas holidays and it's completely understandable.

30/12/23, 12:53 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I hope you are doing well. I was going through your scholarship application file and noticed that you have the remaining part of $150 for your Edoofa Enrollment fee which is due by 14th December 2023. Hence, May I kindly know if you have completed the payment for the same?
