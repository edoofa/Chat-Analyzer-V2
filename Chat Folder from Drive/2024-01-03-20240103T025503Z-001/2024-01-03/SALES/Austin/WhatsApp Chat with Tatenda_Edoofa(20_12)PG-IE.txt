20/12/23, 1:04 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Grades are commendable! <This message was edited>
20/12/23, 1:04 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Ms. Moyo, I want to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*



Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it
20/12/23, 1:05 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Also, As your evaluation progresses, I would like to appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country.

20/12/23, 1:09 pm - +263 77 405 5428: As regards to this sir noo we haven't applied to any university abroad
20/12/23, 1:10 pm - +263 77 405 5428: Noted with than sir
20/12/23, 1:10 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
20/12/23, 1:13 pm - +263 77 405 5428: Thank you so much for the awareness
20/12/23, 1:20 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Based on my evaluation, considering Tatenda's subjects, interests, and passion, Tatenda is eligible to pursue


*B.Tech. Mechanical Engineering*



Do you want me to explain the course in depth?
20/12/23, 1:21 pm - +263 77 405 5428: Explain in depth sir
20/12/23, 1:23 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *B.Tech. Mechanical Engineering* is a 4-year undergraduate course

First thing any engineering aspirant considers while choosing a branch in Engineering is placement aspect and the course very well caters to it. A few questions which arise when admissions to engineering colleges commence include the branch in demand, highest paid engineering graduates and others such.  Apart from this palcement criteria, there are some other parameters which should be considered while choosing a discipline like- what are the research opportunities, what is scope of career growth etc.

Mechanical Engineering is the evergreen branch of engineering. Market scenario and demand of engineering graduates change every year but the demand of mechanical engineering degree will never be obsolete. Mechanical engineering graduates can find placements in almost every sector, right from construction sector to steel industry and from automobile to software.

Following are the sub disciplines that are associated with mechanical engineering:

*Production Engineering*
*Industrial Engineering*
*Manufacturing Engineering*
*Automobile Engineering*
*Artificial Intelligence*

The field of mechanical engineering can be thought of as a collection of many mechanical engineering science disciplines. Several of these subdisciplines which are typically taught at the undergraduate level are listed below, with a brief explanation and the most common application of each. Some of these subdisciplines are unique to mechanical engineering, while others are a combination of mechanical engineering and one or more other disciplines. Most work that a mechanical engineer does uses skills and techniques from several of these subdisciplines, as well as specialized subdisciplines. Specialized subdisciplines, as used in this article, are more likely to be the subject of graduate studies or on-the-job training than undergraduate research. Several specialized sub disciplines are discussed in this section.

*Mechanics* 

Mechanics is, in the most general sense, the study of forces and their effect upon matter. Typically, engineering mechanics is used to analyze and predict the acceleration and deformation (both elastic and plastic) of objects under known forces (also called loads) or stresses. Subdisciplines of mechanics include Statics, the study of non-moving bodies under known loads, how forces affect static bodies Dynamics the study of how forces affect moving bodies. Dynamics includes kinematics (about movement, velocity, and acceleration) and kinetics (about forces and resulting accelerations). Mechanics of materials, the study of how different materials deform under various types of stress Fluid mechanics, the study of how fluids react to forces Kinematics, the study of the motion of bodies (objects) and systems (groups of objects), while ignoring the forces that cause the motion. Kinematics is often used in the design and analysis of mechanisms. Continuum mechanics, a method of applying mechanics that assumes that objects are continuous (rather than discrete) Mechanical engineers typically use mechanics in the design or analysis phases of engineering. If the engineering project were the design of a vehicle, statics might be employed to design the frame of the vehicle, in order to evaluate where the stresses will be most intense. Dynamics might be used when designing the car's engine, to evaluate the forces in the pistons and cams as the engine cycles. Mechanics of materials might be used to choose appropriate materials for the frame and engine. Fluid mechanics might be used to design a ventilation system for the vehicle (see HVAC), or to design the intake system for the engine

*Mechatronics and Robotics*

Mechatronics is a combination of mechanics and electronics. It is an interdisciplinary branch of mechanical engineering, electrical engineering and software engineering that is concerned with integrating electrical and mechanical engineering to create hybrid systems. In this way, machines can be automated through the use of electric motors, servo-mechanisms, and other electrical systems in conjunction with special software. A common example of a mechatronics system is a CD-ROM drive. Mechanical systems open and close the drive, spin the CD and move the laser, while an optical system reads the data on the CD and converts it to bits. Integrated software controls the process and communicates the contents of the CD to the computer.

Robotics is the application of mechatronics to create robots, which are often used in industry to perform tasks that are dangerous, unpleasant, or repetitive. These robots may be of any shape and size, but all are preprogrammed and interact physically with the world. To create a robot, an engineer typically employs kinematics (to determine the robot's range of motion) and mechanics (to determine the stresses within the robot).

Robots are used extensively in industrial engineering. They allow businesses to save money on labor, perform tasks that are either too dangerous or too precise for humans to perform them economically, and to ensure better quality. Many companies employ assembly lines of robots, especially in Automotive Industries and some factories are so robotized that they can run by themselves. Outside the factory, robots have been employed in bomb disposal, space exploration, and many other fields. Robots are also sold for various residential applications, from recreation to domestic applications.

*Thermodynamics and Thermo-science*

Thermodynamics is an applied science used in several branches of engineering, including mechanical and chemical engineering. At its simplest, thermodynamics is the study of energy, its use and transformation through a system. Typically, engineering thermodynamics is concerned with changing energy from one form to another. As an example, automotive engines convert chemical energy (enthalpy) from the fuel into heat, and then into mechanical work that eventually turns the wheels.

Thermodynamics principles are used by mechanical engineers in the fields of heat transfer, thermofluids, and energy conversion. Mechanical engineers use thermo-science to design engines and power plants, heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems, heat exchangers, heat sinks, radiators, refrigeration, insulation, and others.

*Design and drafting*

Drafting or technical drawing is the means by which mechanical engineers design products and create instructions for manufacturing parts. A technical drawing can be a computer model or hand-drawn schematic showing all the dimensions necessary to manufacture a part, as well as assembly notes, a list of required materials, and other pertinent information. A U.S. mechanical engineer or skilled worker who creates technical drawings may be referred to as a drafter or draftsman. Drafting has historically been a two-dimensional process, but computer-aided design (CAD) programs now allow the designer to create in three dimensions.

Instructions for manufacturing a part must be fed to the necessary machinery, either manually, through programmed instructions, or through the use of a computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) or combined CAD/CAM program. Optionally, an engineer may also manually manufacture a part using the technical drawings. However, with the advent of computer numerically controlled (CNC) manufacturing, parts can now be fabricated without the need for constant technician input. Manually manufactured parts generally consist of spray coatings, surface finishes, and other processes that cannot economically or practically be done by a machine.

Drafting is used in nearly every subdiscipline of mechanical engineering, and by many other branches of engineering and architecture. Three-dimensional models created using CAD software are also commonly used in finite element analysis (FEA) and computational fluid dynamics (CFD).

20/12/23, 2:52 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Ms. Moyo, I see that you understand the quality of higher education that Edoofa seeks to deliver to its students so that after completing their education, the students can achieve their career goals and have a prosperous career ahead of them.

So, are you or any of your family members aware of the expense of a comparable quality higher education for an international student without a scholarship in India?
20/12/23, 2:56 pm - +263 77 405 5428: This message was deleted
20/12/23, 2:58 pm - +263 77 405 5428: No
20/12/23, 2:59 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's alright, Ms. Moyo, Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth!
In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc., it is still beyond the reach of many.
With the Edoofa Scholarship Program, the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Laundry, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
20/12/23, 3:00 pm - +263 77 405 5428: Ok
20/12/23, 3:02 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
20/12/23, 3:05 pm - +263 77 405 5428: Yes
20/12/23, 3:06 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Good to hear that!!


So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians. Looking at this cost of education, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits which can help you in reducing their fees further.


And do you know how that is done?
20/12/23, 3:08 pm - +263 77 405 5428: No
20/12/23, 3:09 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's alright, Let me tell you how Edoofa helps students bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the


*Earn While You Learn Program*


The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
20/12/23, 3:09 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.


*The EWYL Program*, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
20/12/23, 3:09 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *The EWYL Program* has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
20/12/23, 3:09 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Projects with Brands and Companies: -*
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, The following are:
Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
20/12/23, 3:09 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Recruitment Partners: -*
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics
20/12/23, 3:10 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
20/12/23, 3:10 pm - Pallika Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.
20/12/23, 3:10 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *What are your views on the same? Do you think you will benefit from the Earn While You Learn Program?*
20/12/23, 3:10 pm - +263 77 405 5428: Yes
20/12/23, 3:11 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Indeed


If I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.


*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly*.
20/12/23, 3:13 pm - +263 77 405 5428: Ok
20/12/23, 3:13 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Ms. Moyo, Now, As we are proceeding towards the end of the session, let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to is different from other scholarship programs, A few facts that you must have noticed during our counseling:
1. *Expert Career Counseling*: We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced, and empathetic career counselors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.

2. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save up to $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off

3. *Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What's more, students earn

*4.*Higher Education Concierge*: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education*.

After going through the facts that make Edoofa different, 
Let me know which point out of the 4  you like the most.
20/12/23, 3:14 pm - +263 77 405 5428: 3
20/12/23, 3:15 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Great! 
So now I know you focus more on *Earn While You Learn*

Let me also show you some monthly earnings of students through Earn While You Learn.

20/12/23, 3:16 pm - +263 77 405 5428: Ok
20/12/23, 3:18 pm - Pallika Edoofa: So, Ms. Moyo,  I believe you'll be discussing everything with your family as well after we complete today's session. Also after our counseling session, I would connect to some of our Beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know the proceedings well.

So may I know how you and your family feel about Tatenda studying abroad?
20/12/23, 3:19 pm - +263 77 405 5428: OK I will
20/12/23, 3:19 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I was asking a question, Ms. Moyo.
20/12/23, 3:20 pm - +263 77 405 5428: We would like for Tatenda to study abroad
20/12/23, 3:21 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Ms. Moyo, I am glad to hear that, as studying Internationally would make his career advance at an even greater pace, as he will be transformed into a professional with a Greater Paying Job, which would actually help him in uplifting his family there by himself, and provide a peaceful and hassle-free life to his parents.
20/12/23, 3:21 pm - Pallika Edoofa: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be 

1) *Application Form*

2) *Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

3) *Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university

Isn't it?
20/12/23, 3:22 pm - +263 77 405 5428: Yes
20/12/23, 3:22 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Indeed
When a student applies alone for an international University, on average the application fee of a University is *$150-$200*. Statement of Purpose of the students costs between *$120-$150* respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it.

Now this basically means, that for a student to apply to just *5 Universities the average cost* incurred by him/her would be somewhere between *$1350-1750* *(Application Form + Statement of Purpose) without* even receiving a guarantee to be selected for not
20/12/23, 3:22 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Do you know this is one reason that Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurance of what would happen, just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.

So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create *the statement of purpose but also helps you with the Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection, sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than *$1350-$1750* without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only *$750*. *This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.*
20/12/23, 3:23 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
20/12/23, 3:23 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I hope you understand now. So, Shall I explain to you when and why the enrollment fee is paid?
20/12/23, 3:27 pm - +263 77 405 5428: Yes
20/12/23, 3:27 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, This enrollment fee is to be paid only if a student qualifies for the Edoofa program and includes your
*-Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
*-Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
*-Earn While You Learn Program and training*
*-University sessions and interactions*
*-A guaranteed scholarship seat*
*-Visa Documentation Assistance*
*The Foster and Care throughout your course*
20/12/23, 3:27 pm - Pallika Edoofa: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is *found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
20/12/23, 3:27 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Basically, there are 3 phases of the enrollment process.


*Phase 1*: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation
If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.


*Phase 2*: Once the students complete Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-level result is out).


*Phase 3*: Once the final A-level results are out if the student has passed the necessary requirements as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission will be continued. However, if the student doesn't meet the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the $350 would be refunded to the parents.


*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.*
20/12/23, 3:31 pm - +263 77 405 5428: Ok
20/12/23, 3:33 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
20/12/23, 3:36 pm - +263 77 405 5428: 1
20/12/23, 3:37 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's right!!!
20/12/23, 3:37 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Well,
We are at stage one but have also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which are stage 4.

*In Step 1: Connect with a counselor*- As your counselor, we are going through the counseling process, discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

*In Step 2: Eligibility Check*- The eligibility check includes the interviews with the Academic Board and the Test.

*Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa*- If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

*Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program*- This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.


We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
20/12/23, 3:38 pm - +263 77 405 5428: Yes
20/12/23, 3:39 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 5*: After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities.



*August 2025 intake, applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.*



This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.
20/12/23, 3:39 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 6:* Once you are done with the registration fee payment, you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.
 
I hope you are clear with the process.
20/12/23, 3:40 pm - +263 77 405 5428: Yes
20/12/23, 3:40 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Ms. Moyo, we have come to the end of your counseling session, now Before I guide you *Step 2 is the Eligibility Check.*
 
I want you to have a full-fledged discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family -

21/12/23, 10:35 am - Pallika Edoofa: It is good to connect with you today, Ms. Moyo,
I hope you are doing well.
21/12/23, 10:35 am - Pallika Edoofa: As you have been following the sessions on the group regarding the program. What are your thoughts on the Edoofa Scholarship Program and do you have any questions for me, please?
21/12/23, 10:36 am - +263 77 405 5428: So far so good. Maybe just more elaboration on the eligibility criteria, which I'm sure  you are about to do now
21/12/23, 10:39 am - +263 77 405 5428: As for the scholarship program, excellent and very promising for my son. I look forward to him being a beneficiary
21/12/23, 10:46 am - Pallika Edoofa: Ms. Moyo, The eligibility procedures are the criteria or set of evaluations that you need to get through inorder to be eligible for the Edoofa Scholarship Program. They include-

-Final interview with Program Director(via whatsapp voice notes from a different interview group)
-Video interaction with your parents/parent

Your Academics, understanding of the program, willingness to be a part of the Edoofa family, personal traits, qualities, previous experiences, career aspirations, techchnical knowledge on the field opted etc would be evaluated!
21/12/23, 10:49 am - +263 77 405 5428: Understood
21/12/23, 10:51 am - Pallika Edoofa: Is there anything you would like to ask me regarding the program now?
21/12/23, 10:54 am - +263 77 405 5428: Yes
21/12/23, 10:56 am - +263 77 405 5428: When is the registration fee and  how am i going to pay the fee
21/12/23, 11:02 am - Pallika Edoofa: Ms. Moyo, For all the applicants who would be traveling to India for 2025 year's academic intake. Their application would utilize this time duration of 20 months in the following manner

*1. The student would be working on their Earn While You Learn Program:-* Having a head start that too of more than 13 months helps a student have a better hold in their EWYL Journey. During these years, one thing which I have personally witnessed is that a student who have better understanding of their EWYL projects and the ones who earn higher amount of scholarship credits every month, are the ones who always had this headstart in their career.

Giving you an example, *Persistance Muza* the student who earned over $4000 worth or scholarship credits, became a part of the Edoofa Program for his August 2022 intake in August 2021. The student earned more than $1900 worth of scholarship credits before even coming to India and within just a couple of months after arriving he has now earned an additional $2100 worth of scholarship credits, which has ensured his parents that he can cater for his annual fee after the scholarship through his hard work in the Earn While You Learn Program itself. 

This happened only because students like him had time to understand the projects and assignments while being in their home country. 

*2. Parents' Communication with the Admission's Team:* Having ample time at hand benefits not only the student but also allows parents to better plan their child's international education journey. To leverage this advantage, you will engage with the admissions team immediately after completing your enrollment process, preparing for your child's academic journey in the 2025 intake. Admission Officers will assist you in proper financial planning for the 25 academic year. This means it's the right time to start saving for your child's annual fees after scholarship, and if you face any challenges, they can be addressed in advance. Motive of financial planning would be to ensure that all the parents are in a much better position in terms of finances by August 2024, once financial planning is completed till August 2024, you'll start receiving Offer Letters from the Universities around September/October 2024. This gives you the advantage of selecting the University of your choice. This process offers convenience to parents as the Admission Officers assist in financial preparation, alleviating any burdens towards the end.

*3,  Having the benefit of the Community:-* This part doesn't just benefits the student but actually benefits the entire family. The moment student becomes a part of the Edoofa Program he/she starts interacting with other students who are a part of the community, this helps the student to connect with toppers of their fields, students who have scored a perfect result in their A Level during their academic year, this way a student gets the access to get all his/her queries addressed in terms of academics for their current year of education from the topper students, thereby reducing the need of private tuitions for the same, for which the parents would have paid additional money over and above their school fee.
21/12/23, 11:06 am - +263 77 405 5428: Understood
21/12/23, 11:13 am - Pallika Edoofa: Great, May I know if you have any other queries, please
21/12/23, 11:14 am - +263 77 405 5428: No queries Sir
21/12/23, 11:16 am - Pallika Edoofa: This is well noted, 
May I know your thoughts regarding the financial aspects such as enrollment fees and cost of education, please
21/12/23, 11:39 am - +263 77 405 5428: I am flexible on enrollment fees and I think costs are fair. With my son's enthusiasm and hard work I believe y e earn as you learn mode will make it possible
21/12/23, 11:39 am - Pallika Edoofa: I appreciate your willingness to invest in your child’s career
