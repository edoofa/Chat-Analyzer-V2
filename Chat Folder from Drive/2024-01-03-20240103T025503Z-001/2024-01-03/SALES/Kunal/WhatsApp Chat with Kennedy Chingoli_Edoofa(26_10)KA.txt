27/10/23, 1:20 pm - Kunal: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees.

We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
27/10/23, 1:20 pm - Kunal: Since our most recent trip to Malawi, we've been experiencing a huge rush of applications from the country as a result of how well we were able to communicate our testimony and commitment to giving students access to high-quality, affordable higher education while also delivering the most industry-accelerated and impactful curriculum. 

With more than 100 enrolled students from the country, we have connections with, a number of schools, educators and reformers around Malawi, and a large number of students who have registered from institutions including Chaminade High, Willams Murray, Beautiful Gate, and others.

*I believe you are looking forward to such an opportunity for your career, aren't you?*
27/10/23, 1:25 pm - +265 984 49 86 04: Yes I'm and I will be much happier when if I will be the part of it.
27/10/23, 1:49 pm - Kunal: Good to hear that
27/10/23, 1:49 pm - Kunal: Now being your counsellor I  would like to give you the opportunity to express more about yourself. Please include your educational qualifications, career aspirations, the province that you live in, hobbies & interests, about your family and siblings, which professions your parents are into, and more in detail.
You can also add anything more that you would like to share.
27/10/23, 6:41 pm - +265 984 49 86 04: I did my MSCE Examination at Nkhoma Secondary School. My certificate has grades with flying colors as follows; mathematics=6, chemistry=6, biology=5, English=4, physics=4, Agriculture=4, social & life  skills=4 and chichewa=4.

I was born in  the family of five children and I am the first born. Currently I'm staying in Lilongwe (Rural West) and my parents have nothing to do despite selling tomatoes and some vegetables...
As a first born in our family I have a desire to further my education so that I can change the lives of my brothers and sisters and if I were given a  chance  to choose a course to study, I would like to do nursing because I feel it's what can help me achieve my dreams. <This message was edited>
27/10/23, 6:50 pm - +265 984 49 86 04: Thanks for allowing me to explain myself. Please if there is something left, I would like you to be asking questions.

I was waiting for you to share your concerns with me but unfortunately, I didn’t hear from you and therefore I was asked to put your application on hold, but before doing the same, I was going through the form you submitted, I noticed that you come from a family background wherein you plan to pursue your higher education abroad and was looking for a scholarship. I am looking forward to hearing from you so that I can make your dream of higher education abroad come true through an affordable, accessible, and employment-oriented higher education program.

*Please Note by tomorrow*, I would have to submit my final response regarding your application, so failure to get back to me would mean cancellation of your application after which you would have to re-apply
