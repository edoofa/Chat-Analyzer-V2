17/10/23, 7:38 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
17/10/23, 7:38 pm - Kunal: Well, I am sure after seeing all these amazing facts, you are intrigued to study in India. So can you now tell me, How would studying in India implement a positive impact on your career and How do you aim to achieve your career aspirations from studying in India?
17/10/23, 7:47 pm - +263 71 570 6352: Well I think studying in India will boost my career because now the country is being considered as one of the best educational institutions  so law firms would want to hire someone who has studied in India
17/10/23, 7:51 pm - Kunal: Amazing!
As I can see, you have understood the quality of higher education  which Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead.

By any chance are you familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship?
17/10/23, 7:52 pm - +263 71 570 6352: No I'm not
17/10/23, 7:55 pm - Kunal: Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth! 

In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc,it is still beyond the reach of many.
With the Edoofa Scholarship Program,the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library,Wifi,Laundry,etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
17/10/23, 7:55 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
17/10/23, 7:55 pm - Kunal: In simple words what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well. 

However as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, simply after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.
17/10/23, 7:58 pm - +263 71 570 6352: Ohh I understand thank you
17/10/23, 7:59 pm - +263 71 570 6352: So what if the student have a 100% scholarship  . What will be the expense
17/10/23, 8:13 pm - +1 (303) 842-8838: Hi everyone, I read some of the conversations. I will read as time allows.
17/10/23, 8:49 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
18/10/23, 5:16 am - +263 71 570 6352: Today at 9   am I have an exam so I will be available around 1pm in the afternoon
18/10/23, 9:46 am - Kunal: Good morning everyone
How are you doing?
18/10/23, 9:46 am - Kunal: Thank you for informing
18/10/23, 9:53 am - +263 71 579 5879: Morning how are you.here we are fine
18/10/23, 10:02 am - Kunal: Good to hear that
18/10/23, 10:02 am - Kunal: Have you gone through the session above?
18/10/23, 10:08 am - +263 71 579 5879: Yes I have gone through it
18/10/23, 10:11 am - Kunal: Please note that the Edoofa Scholarship offers 50-100% scholarship on tuition fees, The final percentage of the scholarship will be decided after the University Sessions of an Edoofian after his/her enrollment

The percentage of scholarships is determined by the following factors

1) Academic Excellence
2) Merit
3) Previous Experiences
4) Recommendations from Edoofa
5) Statement of Purpose(SOP) 
6) Extracurricular Activities

So the universities will evaluate them to decide the final quantum of the scholarship
18/10/23, 10:11 am - Kunal: So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians.Looking at this cost of education also, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits and which can help you in reducing their fees further.
And do you know how that is done?
18/10/23, 10:13 am - +263 71 579 5879: I don't have any idea on how that is done
18/10/23, 10:16 am - Kunal: Let me tell you how Edoofa helps students bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the 

*Earn While You Learn Program*

The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
18/10/23, 10:16 am - Kunal: Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.


The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
18/10/23, 10:16 am - Kunal: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
18/10/23, 10:16 am - Kunal: *Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library,Wifi,Laundry,etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
18/10/23, 10:42 am - Kunal: <Media omitted>
18/10/23, 10:42 am - Kunal: In simple words what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well. 

However as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, simply after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.
18/10/23, 10:43 am - Kunal: In the end the cost of their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses are included in this cost only and the cost of transportation is catered by the family
18/10/23, 1:59 pm - Kunal: Are we connected?
18/10/23, 2:06 pm - +263 71 570 6352: Yes good afternoon
18/10/23, 2:06 pm - Kunal: Have you gone through this?
18/10/23, 2:07 pm - +263 71 570 6352: Let me check I'm just coming back from my exam
18/10/23, 2:07 pm - Kunal: How was your exam?
18/10/23, 2:08 pm - +263 71 570 6352: It was okay
18/10/23, 2:09 pm - +263 71 570 6352: So are you saying that if you give me a 50% scholarship then you'll also find a job for me so that I will work to cover the other half
18/10/23, 2:18 pm - Kunal: You can refer this, Heather
18/10/23, 2:20 pm - +263 71 570 6352: Ohh okay I now understand
18/10/23, 2:30 pm - Kunal: If I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly*.
18/10/23, 2:46 pm - +263 71 570 6352: Ohh okay I get it now
18/10/23, 2:56 pm - Kunal: Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counseling : 

 1. *Expert Career Counseling*: We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counselors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.
18/10/23, 2:56 pm - Kunal: 2. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off
18/10/23, 2:56 pm - Kunal: 3. *Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What's more, students earn
18/10/23, 2:56 pm - Kunal: *4.*Higher Education Concierge*: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education*.
18/10/23, 2:56 pm - Kunal: After going through the facts that make Edoofa different, 
Let me know which point out of the 4  you like the most.
18/10/23, 2:58 pm - +263 71 570 6352: I think this one
18/10/23, 2:59 pm - Kunal: Great! 
So now I know you focus more on affordability and employability.
Let me also show you some monthly earnings of students through Earn While you Learn.

18/10/23, 2:59 pm - Kunal: There is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it  depends upon his/her hard work.
However may I know, who will be helping you with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
18/10/23, 3:29 pm - Kunal: Are we connected?
18/10/23, 3:55 pm - +263 71 570 6352: My family members such as my mom and my aunt
18/10/23, 3:59 pm - Kunal: That's completely understandable,
So, I believe you'll be discussing everything with them after we complete today's session. Also after our counseling session I would connect to some of our Beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know the proceedings well.

So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
18/10/23, 4:00 pm - +263 71 570 6352: Okay no problem 




Well they're okay with it ..they think it would be a great opportunity for me
18/10/23, 4:01 pm - Kunal: I am glad to hear that, as studying Internationally would make your career advance at even a greater pace, as you will be transformed to a professional with a Greater Paying Job, which would actually help you in uplifting your family thereby yourself, and provide a peaceful and hassle free life to your parents.
18/10/23, 4:01 pm - Kunal: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be 

1) Application Form 

2) Statement of Purpose which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

3) Letter of Recommendation from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university
18/10/23, 4:03 pm - +263 71 570 6352: I think what you have mentioned is all that is required
18/10/23, 4:03 pm - Kunal: Indeed
*When a student applies alone for an international University* , on an average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose of the students costs higher between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it.

Now this basically means, for a student to apply to just 5 Universities the average cost incurred by him/her would be somewhere between $1350-1750 (Application Form + Statement of Purpose). *without even recieving a guarantee to be selected on not
18/10/23, 4:03 pm - +263 71 570 6352: Yeah
18/10/23, 4:03 pm - Kunal: And do you know this is one reason which Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurity of what would happen, and just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.

So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create the statement of purpose but also helps you with the Visa Documentation Assistance,University Selection and sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc All these facilities would cost you more than $1350-$1750 without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only $750. This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.

18/10/23, 5:03 pm - Kunal: Shall we proceed?
18/10/23, 6:19 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
19/10/23, 9:45 am - Kunal: Good Morning,

*“You can either experience the pain of discipline or the pain of regret. The choice is yours.”*

On a positive note, I am here to begin our session
Are you ready?
19/10/23, 11:11 am - +263 71 579 5879: Morning mam how are you,Thank you for all the information that you send to us we now have an appreciation of how your program works , However Heather can't take this scholarship even if she is eligible or you gave her the offer because I can't pay for the expenses that will cost between 2000-3000us ,I can't afford coz I'm a single parent who is also taking care of her siblings unless if the scholarship is 100 percent. So I would rather send her to our local Universities  where we can afford
19/10/23, 11:13 am - +263 71 579 5879: Please note that Heather is also writing her examination now and she need time to concentrate for now let's just end the session here whenever we feel that we have any questions to ask we can contact you
19/10/23, 11:17 am - Kunal: I understand
However, as per my experience and as I already mentioned ahead, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, simply after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.
19/10/23, 11:17 am - Kunal: Also, as per your understanding, may I know what is the cost of education at your local university?
19/10/23, 11:38 am - +263 71 579 5879: It's ok we have heard all that but for now let's take a break
19/10/23, 11:51 am - Kunal: May I know what happened?
19/10/23, 2:57 pm - Kunal: As you know, students are currently occupied with lessons and exam preparations due to which they are unavailable now. When you compare this with the Western African Countries students will be available with results much earlier than Zimbabweans, and there is a high chance that the scholarship seats would be occupied by them which in turn would be a loss for Zimbabwean students. At the same time, the day scholars in Zimbabwe are still applying and clearing the tests.
19/10/23, 2:57 pm - Kunal: All these factors have been a disadvantage for the boarding students and specifically the students who aren't supposed to use their devices in School. By the time they are back, the opportunity might be vacated by other applicants. This is the reason why our Academic Board along with the discussion with Universities has decided to allow parents to take part in the seat reservation of the students
19/10/23, 5:07 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
20/10/23, 9:47 pm - Kunal: Let us connect at *9:00 am CAT Tomorrow to resume your session *(In case you have any challenges, please let me know the time you will be available, and we will schedule accordingly)*

Please note that your participation and activeness is an important parameters of evaluation. 

*In case the student is having lessons, the parents can also take part in the session*

Stay Blessed!
21/10/23, 9:21 am - Kunal: Good morning
Let us be grateful for this new day of our lives. 

So I am here to continue with your application 

How are you this morning?
21/10/23, 9:39 am - +263 71 570 6352: I'm good and you
21/10/23, 9:40 am - Kunal: I am doing fine, thank you
21/10/23, 9:40 am - Kunal: Have you gone through the session above?
21/10/23, 9:40 am - +263 71 570 6352: Yes I have
21/10/23, 9:46 am - Kunal: Basically, there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

Phase 3: Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.
21/10/23, 9:47 am - Kunal: This enrollment fee includes your

-Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team
-Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities
-Earn While You Learn Program and training
-University sessions and interactions
-A guaranteed scholarship seat 
-Visa Documentation Assistance 
The Foster and Care throughout your course
21/10/23, 9:47 am - Kunal: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is *found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
21/10/23, 2:03 pm - Kunal: Are we connected?
