*I am Mr. Kunal, Career Counselor at Edoofa and with us, we have Mr. Jyotishman, Head of Admissions and Mr Austin, Senior Career Counselor at Edoofa*

We have received your application for the Edoofa scholarship program.

Due to the overwhelming response from applicants, we wanted to ensure you receive personalized attention. Therefore, we've scheduled a dedicated time slot just for you:

📅 *Date: 17th October 2023*
🕤 *Time: 10:00 AM CAT*

Please mark this date and time on your calendar to ensure you're available for this important counseling session as your active participation is an important parameter for evaluation. To prepare for our session, we encourage you to explore our website at [www.edoofa.com], the video and document shared along. This will provide you with valuable insights into our programs and opportunities. In case the applicant isn't available, parents can initiate the session. Let me know if you have any challenges with the schedule.

18/10/23, 9:45 am - Kunal: Good morning everyone
How are you doing?
23/10/23, 10:12 am - Kunal: Good day to all,

I trust this message finds you in good health.

Having received your application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, I understand that you are seeking an opportunity not only to study abroad but also to build a career abroad through affordable, accessible, and employable education. However, over the last few days, it seems you haven't been able to respond, possibly due to reasons I am not aware of. This has led to an incomplete discussion regarding your scholarship application.

Often, we might have questions, queries, or doubts in our minds that we hesitate to share with others, assuming we might be judged or not understood properly. I want to assure you that at Edoofa, we are here to help you gain a comprehensive understanding of the entire process and address each and every doubt you may have.

In order to assist you in achieving an 80-100% scholarship, I am looking forward to a positive response from you soon.

Best regards,

Kunal
25/10/23, 10:07 am - Kunal: Greetings everyone
I hope you all are doing fine.

We have been expecting your responses and participation in the session.
Since we are experiencing a rush of applicants, we wish that no deserving candidate misses the opportunity
So, if you are not willing to continue, we will be revoking your application by the end of the day (25/10/2023) and will be allotting your slot to the next applicant.

In case you wish to proceed with the program, make sure to notify the group at the earliest so that I can guide you ahead

Stay blessed! <This message was edited>

I was waiting for you to share your concerns with me but unfortunately, I didn’t hear from you and therefore I was asked to put your application on hold, but before doing the same, I was going through the form you submitted, I noticed that you come from a family background wherein you plan to pursue your higher education abroad and was looking for a scholarship. I am looking forward to hearing from you so that I can make your dream of higher education abroad come true through an affordable, accessible, and employment-oriented higher education program.

*Please Note by tomorrow*, I would have to submit my final response regarding your application, so failure to get back to me would mean cancellation of your application after which you would have to re-apply
