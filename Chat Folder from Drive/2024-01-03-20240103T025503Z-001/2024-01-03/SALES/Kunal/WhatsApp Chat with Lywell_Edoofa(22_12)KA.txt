Let me help you with the eligibility consideration for Malawi

1 = distinction, 2 = distinction, 3 = credit, 4 = credit, 5 = credit, 6 = credit, 7 = pass, 8 = pass, 9 = fail

Now,we accept upto 7=pass for a subject
Let us say a student has 5 subjects and scored 7 in all of them creating an aggregrate of 35,this would be the maxumum limit for eligibility.All students scoring an aggregate within this range would meet the academic requirement for the program
27/12/23, 10:40 am - Kunal: The minimum requirement was higher pre pandemic but during the pandemic a lot of students failed to recieve enough resources and Educational support which we had shared with the Universities and Ministries due to which the requirements has been lowered but I always encourage my students to target for maximum to increase the chances of Higher Quantum of Scholarship!

I believe you are confident about meeting the requirements and perform well in MSCE!
