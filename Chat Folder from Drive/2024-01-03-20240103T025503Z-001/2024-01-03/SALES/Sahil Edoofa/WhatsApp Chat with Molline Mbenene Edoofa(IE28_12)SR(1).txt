What did you learn about the Edoofa Program after interacting with a student beneficiary of the Edoofa     Scholarship?                                    I learnt that Edoofa can help me get my degree at the same time working.I also learnt I can help other individuals get a scholarship from Edoofa .Edoofa can give me tasks which will benefit my scholarship until I get a fully funded one .On completion  of my desirable degree ,Edoofa can help me get a job.

Why should you be accepted into the Edoofa Program (20-40 Words)?      I believe change starts with me and I also believe that Edoofa can offer me an opportunity to change my life and the future as I want to improve the shortages of urologists in the world .I also believe that Edoofa can give me an opportunity because I am very committed and I easily interact with other people from different backgrounds and different parts of the world .

02/01/24, 7:35 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Okay so Molline, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session* 
*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*

 You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process. Also, they were proactive for at least a day to complete their sessions. <This message was edited>
