18/12/23, 10:20 am - +263 71 777 9387: India
18/12/23, 10:22 am - Harmehak: Correct
18/12/23, 10:22 am - Harmehak: Well received, Nokutenda, let me share more about the program with you.

You see, *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4000 students from different African countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
18/12/23, 10:22 am - Harmehak: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program. 
We are associated with more than 200 schools in Zimbabwe. Some of the most elite Schools in Zimbabawe example in Harare we are collaborated with St. Dominic’s Chishawasha, Dominican Convent, Christ Ministries and many others. In Manicaland we have a total of 18 Schools to name a few St. David’s Girls Bonda, Hartzell High, First Class, First Choice and so on.  Chipinge we have Chibuwe High School, you would be happy to know that the DEO’s of Mutare and Chipinge have their kids under the Edoofa Scholarship. Masvingo we have 24 Schools collaborated with over 300 students from some of the best schools example Pamushana, St. Antony’s, Reformed Church Gutu, Zaka High and many others. The program is also appreciated by the Education Inspector of Bikita Madam Makomeke.We have more than 500 students from Mashonaland (West, Central and East) Province, Midlands Province.  Last but not the Least we also have Schools from Bulawayo and Matebaland South associated with Edoofa. 

Our collaborations with the UCE College Bulawayo adds a feather to the Cap of trust that Edoofa has built in a span of 14 years. 

The Schools, Institutions and Educationists who have made efforts to train the students for this prestigious Scholarship Program are also the Authorized Designatories of EDOOFA in Zimbabawe. 
We have Mr. Shorwi Kawadza (Retd. Headmaster Hartzell), Mr. Charles Jerera (Retd. Ministry of Education), Ms. Christina Rockson (Founder and Principal of Hilltop Christian College in SA) who have shown relentless efforts to guide students on the right path to success.EDOOFA boasts a proud students and parents community of more than 2000 from Zimbabwe who are happy with the quality of education and the employability outcomes.
18/12/23, 10:27 am - +263 71 777 9387: okay okay
18/12/23, 10:27 am - Harmehak: I feel you too are looking for something like this, so that just like these students you can cater for your higher education by your own self and help your parents reduce their financial burden, isn't it?
18/12/23, 10:28 am - +263 71 777 9387: sure ,it is ma'am
18/12/23, 10:30 am - Harmehak: *Alright so Nokutenda, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.*

I would like to know you better as a student so please go ahead, tell me a bit about yourself, your education, how much USD Langham girls charges you every term, along with what do you wish to study, your strengths and weaknesses, and your hobbies, since I honestly don't know a lot about you?

We do greatly appreciate her aswell
18/12/23, 10:48 am - Harmehak: Indeed please,

May I know more about your sibling, Nokutenda?
18/12/23, 10:50 am - +263 71 777 9387: This message was deleted
18/12/23, 10:52 am - +263 71 777 9387: <Media omitted>
18/12/23, 10:54 am - Harmehak: It's a pleasure to know more about him, Nokutenda.
18/12/23, 10:54 am - Harmehak: Well Nokutenda now as we proceed ahead, I would like to your thoughts on higher education abroad!

Do you believe it's a life changing decision?
18/12/23, 10:55 am - +263 71 777 9387: yes i believe it's a life changing decision
18/12/23, 10:55 am - Harmehak: Alright Nokutenda, and would you add that you are mentally prepared for a life abroad too?
18/12/23, 10:56 am - +263 71 777 9387: yes ma'am i am prepared
18/12/23, 10:56 am - Harmehak: Nokutenda, I am delighted to see your dedication and I believe you would agree with me that commitment from your parents is equally important!

So now could you please share, if your family members are aware of your plans to study abroad and if they are willing to support your higher education abroad mentally and financially?
18/12/23, 10:58 am - +263 71 777 9387: They are all aware of my plans and are willing to support me throughout the tertiary level
18/12/23, 10:58 am - +263 71 777 9387: we even discussed about the issue and they thought of it being a good idea
18/12/23, 11:01 am - Harmehak: I appreciate their thorough support, Nokutenda.
18/12/23, 11:01 am - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!
18/12/23, 11:02 am - +263 71 777 9387: okay okay

yes i am confident
18/12/23, 11:06 am - Harmehak: That's great
18/12/23, 11:06 am - Harmehak: Okay, can you share your O Level results and A level subject combination with me for evaluation along with what motivates you to study Radiology ?
18/12/23, 11:08 am - +263 71 777 9387: <Media omitted>
18/12/23, 11:10 am - +263 71 777 9387: <Media omitted>
18/12/23, 11:11 am - Harmehak: You are required to type the same please, Nokutenda.
18/12/23, 11:40 am - +263 71 777 9387: <Media omitted>
18/12/23, 11:45 am - +263 71 777 9387: *Title*: Radiology
*Type*: Medical discipline
*Description*: Radiology is the medical discipline that uses medical imaging to diagnose diseases and guide their treatment, within the bodies of humans and other animals.
*Activity_sectors*: Medicine
*Fields_of_employment*: Hospitals, Clinics
*Names*: Radiologist; Physician; RoentgenologistAs with any medical specialty, the road to becoming a radiologist requires years of hard work and dedication. Radiology residency programs are particularly challenging: they require a lot of reading outside regular work hours. Radiology residencies can be rather competitive to get into. Radiology offers many rewarding careers for different education levels and interests. In about two years, you can land an entry-level position in radiology, such as diagnostic medical sonographer. These in-demand jobs tend to pay well, too. 

 Radiologists begin their education in the same manner as other physicians.
18/12/23, 12:31 pm - Harmehak: I can see you thoroughly researched and you have knowledge, Nokutenda.
18/12/23, 12:32 pm - Harmehak: I can see you didn't pursue Physics, Nokutenda!

I believe it's a crucial science subject, isn't it?
18/12/23, 12:33 pm - +263 71 777 9387: yes and im actually trying to consult students at university doing the program
18/12/23, 12:33 pm - +263 71 777 9387: yes of course i thought of it being a load on me <This message was edited>
18/12/23, 12:56 pm - Harmehak: Alright please
18/12/23, 12:56 pm - Harmehak: Well, if you would have researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*. whereas if they want to study any Engineering Course then they should have *Physics and Maths* in their A level mandatorily.
18/12/23, 12:57 pm - +263 71 777 9387: okay okay
18/12/23, 12:57 pm - Harmehak: Now, majority of the time Zimbabwean students study subjects as per Zimbabwe's requirements, therefore, the only courses left that these students could pursue ahead which would also align with the healthcare sector are 

1. *Bachelor of Science in Biotechnology*

2. *Bachelor of Science in Nutrition and Dietetics*

3. *Bachelor of Science in Microbiology*

4. *Bachelor of Science in Chemistry*

5. *Bachelor of Science in Medical Laboratory Technology*

6. *Bachelor of Science in Cardiovascular Technology*

7. *Bachelor of science in Physiotherapy*
18/12/23, 12:58 pm - +263 71 777 9387: okay okay
18/12/23, 1:03 pm - +263 71 777 9387: This message was deleted
18/12/23, 1:06 pm - +263 71 777 9387: well i would go for Cardiovascular technology
18/12/23, 1:38 pm - Harmehak: Sure please,

So what intrigued you towards Bachelor of science in Cardiovascular Technology?
18/12/23, 1:47 pm - +263 71 777 9387: it has always been in the pipeline along with veterinary science and India is one of the best countries that trains people about the cardiac cycle and i have always loved knowing more about stent implants , defibrillators the circulatory system and much more <This message was edited>
18/12/23, 1:59 pm - Harmehak: Oh alright please!

18/12/23, 2:01 pm - +263 71 777 9387: okay
18/12/23, 2:01 pm - Harmehak: You can go through the same and inform me once done.
18/12/23, 2:11 pm - +263 71 777 9387: im done
18/12/23, 2:12 pm - Harmehak: So would you like to pursue the same?
18/12/23, 2:17 pm - +263 71 777 9387: yes ma'am
18/12/23, 2:18 pm - Harmehak: Alright Nokutenda, since you have understood the course, can you please tell me, if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself in 5 years and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
18/12/23, 2:25 pm - +263 71 777 9387: <Media omitted>
18/12/23, 2:31 pm - Harmehak: That is really great Nokutenda, I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations!

Now, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
18/12/23, 2:31 pm - Harmehak: Do type your answers please.
18/12/23, 2:35 pm - +263 71 777 9387: well i would like to study abroad because due to the fee hike at the Zimbabwean universities i think it'll be a load to my mother and also the job opportunities in Zimbabwe are limited as the economy is downgrading aswell
18/12/23, 2:36 pm - +263 71 777 9387: and i also feel  that being abroad gives me more opportunities and i am valued more once i finish my studies
18/12/23, 2:37 pm - Harmehak: You see, Nokutenda, Senior Academician Mr. Piyush was in Zimbabwe for about 90 days. He had the privilege of meeting many Zimbabwean students who had applied for the Edoofa Program back in 2018-2019. However, at that time, they didn't proceed because they were enticed by the prospect of earning quick money in the country. This year, when they met him, they shared how difficult things have been for them. Some of them, despite holding reputed degrees from UZ, MSU, and HIT, are working as petrol attendants, while others have started careers as mobile/laptop repair technicians. Some were facing even more challenges, resorting to selling Ecocash, Simcards, or vegetables.

Observing this scenario, Mr. Piyush saw many of them regretting not seizing the opportunity when they had the chance. So, what you are sharing, I can understand that, in reality, things are much more challenging over there.
18/12/23, 2:39 pm - +263 71 777 9387: yes they are really challenging most of the graduates after graduating they are home and have no jobs later on ending up doing drugs
18/12/23, 2:40 pm - Harmehak: Indeed, however I am glad you are making efforts for a promising future, Nokutenda 

Now as you know Edoofa Recommends India as a Higher Education destination.

*May I know what is your knowledge or what have you researched about India and Indian Education System which makes you feel that studying in India would help you achieve your dreams?*
18/12/23, 2:48 pm - +263 71 777 9387: well i have researched that its at an affordable  tuition and accommodation fee as compared to studying abroad in other countries to acquire for education in India and also india ranks amongst USA and UK education which shows that its amongst the best especially in the Medical Health Sciences some patients from other countries are referred to India for treatment and care <This message was edited>
18/12/23, 2:57 pm - Harmehak: I can see you have basic knowledge and awareness

18/12/23, 3:04 pm - Harmehak: Did you find the information helpful and interesting, Nokutenda?
18/12/23, 3:06 pm - +263 71 777 9387: yes yes some facts i didnt even know
18/12/23, 3:06 pm - Harmehak: I am glad this intrigued you and you found it helpful!

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
18/12/23, 3:09 pm - +263 71 777 9387: yes yes
18/12/23, 3:10 pm - Harmehak: Alright please
18/12/23, 3:10 pm - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
18/12/23, 3:11 pm - +263 71 777 9387: okay okay
18/12/23, 3:11 pm - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
18/12/23, 3:11 pm - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
18/12/23, 3:11 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
18/12/23, 3:13 pm - +263 71 777 9387: okay i understand
18/12/23, 3:16 pm - Harmehak: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $2000-3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, 

Now *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

What are you thoughts on the same please?
18/12/23, 3:18 pm - +263 71 777 9387: i think its a good aspect you get to earn money while also learning and aswell one's skills are enhanced both ends this gives a  opportunity to even finish your studies paying for yourself <This message was edited>
18/12/23, 3:21 pm - Harmehak: That's very correct, Nokutenda
18/12/23, 3:21 pm - +263 71 777 9387: okay okay 

thank you
18/12/23, 3:22 pm - Harmehak: Nokutenda, from his experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,

While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time. 

This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year. 

Wouldn't you agree to the same?
18/12/23, 3:24 pm - +263 71 777 9387: i do agree
18/12/23, 3:26 pm - Harmehak: So now are you in a better position to relate how Edoofa is making higher education affordable and accessible for international students in India?
18/12/23, 3:26 pm - +263 71 777 9387: yes of course ma'am
18/12/23, 3:28 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

Now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program in detail and how it would assist you.
18/12/23, 3:28 pm - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
18/12/23, 3:28 pm - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
18/12/23, 3:28 pm - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0


Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

18/12/23, 3:33 pm - +263 71 777 9387: okay okay i understand
18/12/23, 3:34 pm - Harmehak: Did you thoroughly follow the shared resources, Nokutenda?
18/12/23, 3:36 pm - +263 71 777 9387: for the links not yet but got through the pictures
18/12/23, 3:36 pm - Harmehak: I understand
18/12/23, 3:36 pm - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
18/12/23, 3:39 pm - +263 71 777 9387: alright
18/12/23, 3:39 pm - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

18/12/23, 3:46 pm - Harmehak: Did you go through the resources and video, Nokutenda?
18/12/23, 3:49 pm - +263 71 777 9387: yes i did
18/12/23, 3:50 pm - +263 71 777 9387: so is it given per month or .....
18/12/23, 3:54 pm - Harmehak: Credits are given month end please.
18/12/23, 3:54 pm - Harmehak: That is great, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes. 

Are you ready?
18/12/23, 3:57 pm - +263 71 777 9387: okay
18/12/23, 4:01 pm - Harmehak: Nokutenda, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
18/12/23, 4:04 pm - +263 71 777 9387: $1500-$2250
18/12/23, 4:09 pm - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
18/12/23, 4:09 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
18/12/23, 4:09 pm - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
18/12/23, 4:10 pm - Harmehak: You see Nokutenda, Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
18/12/23, 4:10 pm - Harmehak changed the group name from "Nokutenda_Edoofa(15/12)HP" to "Nokutenda_Edoofa(15/12)HP 2025"
18/12/23, 4:14 pm - +263 71 777 9387: yes i think so
18/12/23, 4:15 pm - Harmehak: That's amazing, so now that you have understood how Edoofa makes the application process affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
18/12/23, 4:15 pm - Harmehak: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

Phase 3: Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.
18/12/23, 4:15 pm - Harmehak: *However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
18/12/23, 4:16 pm - +263 71 777 9387: okay
18/12/23, 4:19 pm - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared. <This message was edited>
18/12/23, 4:19 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
18/12/23, 4:20 pm - +263 71 777 9387: okay okay
18/12/23, 4:22 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle.
18/12/23, 4:22 pm - Harmehak: Step 5: After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities. 

August 2025 intake, applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from the Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 instalments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.
18/12/23, 4:22 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
18/12/23, 4:24 pm - +263 71 777 9387: yes ma'am
18/12/23, 4:37 pm - Harmehak: Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.
18/12/23, 4:37 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
18/12/23, 4:39 pm - +263 71 777 9387: okay okay i understand
18/12/23, 4:53 pm - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
18/12/23, 4:53 pm - Harmehak: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)
18/12/23, 4:53 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
18/12/23, 5:02 pm - +263 71 777 9387: okay
18/12/23, 5:34 pm - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
18/12/23, 5:34 pm - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
18/12/23, 5:34 pm - Harmehak: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

The final percentage of the scholarship will be decided after the University Sessions of an Edoofian after his/her enrollment.

The percentage of scholarships is determined by the following factors

1) Academic Excellence
2) Merit
3) Previous Experiences
4) Recommendations from Edoofa
5) Statement of Purpose(SOP) 
6) Extra curricular Activities

So the Universites will evaluate them to decide the final quantum of scholarship.

19/12/23, 10:42 am - Harmehak: Have you and your parents already had the opportunity to connect with Mrs. Ruth? You see, her story is truly remarkable. As a single parent, juggling the responsibilities of a small-scale farmer and the mother of two daughters, she has persevered. Her journey with Edoofa is a testament to how dedicated individuals can overcome obstacles.
Mrs. Ruth's experience with Edoofa is a testament to the transformative impact our programs can have. She not only managed her family's needs but also seized the opportunity for her daughters to achieve higher education. The support and guidance she received from Edoofa were instrumental in her success.
The process was challenging, yet incredibly rewarding. Mrs. Ruth's determination, combined with Edoofa's assistance, has paved the way for a brighter future .

1. What is the name of the course which you would be studying through the Edoofa Program?

2. Through Edoofa in which country would you be pursuing your higher education?

3. What is the average cost for studies in that country without a scholarship?

4. What is the annual fee you will pay if found eligible for the program (yearly fee after Edoofa Scholarship)?

5. What is the enrollment fee of the Edoofa Program? 

6. If you are found eligible for the program in how many days you will have to pay the first part of your enrollment fee?

7. After receiving your provisional offer letter from the Edoofa Academic Board, you will have to pay your registration fee in order to finalise your university admission and reserve your scholarship seat. This registration fee will be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?

*Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage.*
A fact that draws our attention is that, according to his position in life, an extravagant man is either admired or loathed. A successful business man does nothing to increase his popularity by being prudent with his money. A person who is wealthy is expected to lead a luxurious life and to be lavish with his hospitality. If he is not so, he is considered mean, and his reputation in business may even suffer in consequence. The paradox remains that he had not been careful with his money in the first place; he would never have achieved his present wealth.
Among the low income group, a different set of values exists. The young clerk, who makes his wife a present of a new dress when he has not paid his house rent, is condemned as extravagant. Carefulness with money to the point of meanness is applauded as a virtue. Nothing in his life is considered more worthy than paying his bills. The ideal wife for such a man separates her housekeeping money into joyless little piles – so much for rent, for food, for the children’s shoes, she is able to face the milkman with equanimity every, month satisfied with her economizing ways , and never knows the guilt of buying something she can’t really afford .
As for myself, I fall neither of these categories. If I have money to spare I can be extravagant, but when, as is usually the case, I am hard up and then I am the meanest man imaginable.

1. Which of the following would be the most appropriate title for the passage
a)The cause of poverty is extravagance.
b)Stingy habits of the poor.
c)Being extravagant is always condemnable.
d)Extravagance is a part of the rich as well as of the poor.

2.According to the passage the person, who is a successful businessman and wealthy
a)Is more popular if he appears to be wasting away his time.
b)Is expected to have lavish lifestyle.
c)Must be extravagant before achieving success.
d)Should not bother about popularity.

3. The phrase ‘lavish with his hospitality’ in the third sentence of the first paragraph means
a)Extravagance in entertaining guest.
b)Unconcerned in treating his friends and relatives.
c)Thoughtful in spending only on guests and strangers.
d)Stinginess in dealing with his relatives.

4.The word ‘paradox’ in the last sentence of the first paragraph means
a)A word that brings out the hidden meaning
b)Statement based on facts
c)a statement that seems self-contradictory but in reality expresses a possible truth.
d)Statement based on the popular opinion

5.What is the meaning of the word “equanimity”?
a)Calmness
b)Discomposure
c)Equivocal
d)Dubious

Whey to Go Greek yogurt—a strained form of cultured yogurt—has grown enormously in popularity in the United States since it was first introduced in the country in the late 1980s. From 2011 to 2012 alone, sales of Greek yogurt in the US increased by 50 percent. The resulting increase in Greek yogurt production has forced those involved in the business to address the detrimental effects that the yogurt-making process may be having on the environment. Fortunately, farmers and others in the Greek yogurt business have found many methods of controlling and eliminating most environmental threats. Given these solutions as well as the many health benefits of the food, the advantages of Greek yogurt Q5. outdo the potential drawbacks of its production.Sentence [1] The main environmental problem caused by the production of Greek yogurt is the creation of acid whey as a by-product.Sentence [2] Because it requires up to four times more milk to make than conventional yogurt does, Greek yogurt produces larger amounts of acid whey, which is difficult to dispose of.Sentence [3] To address the problem of disposal, farmers have found a number of uses for acid whey. Sentence[4] They can add it to livestock feed as a protein Q.6. supplement, and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt.Sentence[5] If it is improperly introduced into the environment, acid-whey runoff Q.7. can pollute waterways, depleting the oxygen content of streams and rivers as it decomposes. Sentence [6] Yogurt manufacturers, food Q.8. scientists; and government officials are also working together to develop additional solutions for reusing whey.

6.supplement, and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt.
A) NO CHANGE

20/12/23, 9:19 am - Harmehak: Good morning Everyone, I hope you are doing well,

I have gotten your test evaluated and now I have your interview slots with me!

However, before I share the interview slots I would want to have a discussion with your parents regarding their preparation.

Are they currently available for the same?
20/12/23, 9:21 am - +263 77 230 9161: Good morning ma'am
20/12/23, 9:24 am - Harmehak: How are you doing today, Mrs Rumbidzai?
20/12/23, 9:26 am - +263 77 230 9161: I'm good..How are you
20/12/23, 9:27 am - Harmehak: I am doing well please
20/12/23, 9:27 am - Harmehak: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
20/12/23, 9:27 am - Harmehak: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
20/12/23, 9:27 am - Harmehak: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.
20/12/23, 9:27 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
20/12/23, 9:48 am - Harmehak: Ideally as you know, the tentative dates:

1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 27th or 28 th December 2023 for $200 and the  27th or 28th of January for the remaining $150.

2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 27th or 28th December 2023. 

Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?
20/12/23, 9:59 am - +263 77 230 9161: I would opt for the first one
20/12/23, 10:02 am - Harmehak: Surely, Mrs Rumbidzai!

23/12/23, 7:20 pm - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/12/23, 7:33 pm - +263 77 230 9161: Thank you
26/12/23, 8:14 am - Sahil Edoofa: @263717779387 @263772309161 Good Morning
How are you doing today ?
26/12/23, 8:14 am - +263 71 777 9387: im good how are you doing
26/12/23, 8:37 am - +263 77 230 9161: Good morning ma'am...
26/12/23, 8:39 am - Sahil Edoofa: Do you want me to guide you about the payment modes in depth ?
26/12/23, 8:53 am - +263 77 230 9161: I have understood that lm depositing 200 us now and the balance within a month of which the due date is 28th of January
26/12/23, 12:21 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Okay so basically you see in the first mode, the Direct Bank Transfer Mode, the transfer charges which are to be borne by the parents of the student ranges between $100 to $120 which become quite high for a lot of parents considering the economic situation in Zimbabwe itself. So as not every student is in a position to cater for an additional $100 to $120 just as transfer charge, the second mode was introduced, wherein, it is the Bank deposit in Mr. Charles's Account, in this the transfer charges get divided amongst 10 students resulting in an equivalent bearing of 12.5% at the end.

So as you can see in the letter that there is a Bank deposit in, Mr. Charles Jerera (Retired Education Officer)'s account as he is our Associated Partner there in Zimbabwe, Since 2020 there have been over 1400+ students who have been assisted by Mr Charles inorder to complete their enrollment formalities as well as university fee payments after arriving in India.
26/12/23, 12:21 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Therefore the fee can also be paid through him. Since his account is a NOSTRO Account which only holds USD itself, therefore the necessary amount including the transfer charges in this mode itself would be $394 ($350 + $44 transfer charges), and the same details are as below:-

BANK NAME: FBC

SWIFT CODE: FBCPZWHA

ACC NAME: CHARLES JERERA

ACC NUMBER: 5333 0380 1404 8828
