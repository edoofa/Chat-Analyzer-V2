I am Ms.Harmehak, Career Counselor at Edoofa.

I am here to evaluate MALAMBO CHIMBEZA's application for the Edoofa Program. 

Shall we start?
28/12/23, 9:33 am - +260 771447063: Sure
28/12/23, 9:35 am - Harmehak: It is a pleasure to connect with you today, 

You can address me as *Ms. Harmehak and we do have with us, Mr. Sahil who is the Senior Career Counselor and Mr. Jyotishman who is the Head of Admissions* and will be evaluating your responses for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
28/12/23, 9:45 am - +260 771447063: Ok
28/12/23, 9:49 am - Harmehak: Malambo, let me share more about the program with you.

You see, *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4000 students from different African countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
28/12/23, 9:50 am - Harmehak: EDOOFA has commended the new government for its dedicated efforts and positive changes in the education sector, including the elimination of school fees, an increase in the number of teachers, and a focus on protecting vulnerable learners, particularly adolescent girls.
28/12/23, 9:50 am - Harmehak: Eoodfa is proud to support the government in its mission to transform the education sector and achieve sustainable development, aimed at ensuring quality education that is inclusive and equitable for all by 2030.
With the influx of students from Zimbabwe, we recorded more than 1500 students to the program in each of the last two years. Having a strong network and grasp of more than 100 schools with a panel of Headmasters, teachers, parents, and other educators, we now look to replicate our success in Zambia as well where we have already begun enrolling students since the since the last 6 months and we have closed 2023 intake with over 1500 students..


Our strong relationships with educational institutions, such as Penmal Connect Ltd. and Trident College in Zambia, have led to numerous successful outcomes and partnerships with schools including Kamulanga High, Canisius Secondary, Sanjongo Secondary, The Copperbelt University, Chavuma Boarding Secondary, Mutanda Boarding Secondary, Chimwemwe Secondary, National Hillcrest, Matero Boys Secondary, and others. We are also connected with institutions like Njase, Ndola Girls, Fatima Secondary, Torbit, and Zambezi Boarding among others, to provide, expand and build upon the opportunities of the Edoofa Scholarship Program for deserving students throughout Zambia

28/12/23, 12:16 pm - +260 771447063: Yes
28/12/23, 12:20 pm - Harmehak: Malambo, I am delighted to see your dedication and I believe you would agree with me that commitment from your parents is equally important!

So now could you please share, if your family members are aware of your plans to study abroad and if they are willing to support your higher education abroad mentally and financially?
28/12/23, 4:03 pm - Harmehak: Are we connected?

@260966229811 @260771447063
28/12/23, 5:30 pm - Harmehak: I was expecting your response, now, I would be scheduling your session for *tomorrow at 9:30 AM CAT*, as my working hours for the day are over and it's already been a long day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
29/12/23, 9:30 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
29/12/23, 9:31 am - +260 771447063: Sure
29/12/23, 9:36 am - Harmehak: I am expecting your response since yesterday please.
29/12/23, 9:37 am - +260 771447063: Okay
29/12/23, 9:38 am - +260 771447063: Yes they are, but it's this a fully funded scholarship program?
29/12/23, 9:49 am - Harmehak: Can you please share your understanding of a fully funded scholarship?
29/12/23, 9:52 am - +260 771447063: I thought you'd provide everything, like help me get a passport, tution fees, accomodation, pocket money, health funds, food and plane funds.
29/12/23, 9:53 am - Harmehak: Actually you are mistaken over here, let me explain to you that there are two kinds of programs that provide assistance to the students because a lot of times parents and students themselves misunderstand what a Scholarship actually means.

*1. Scholarships*
*2. Sponsorships*

Scholarships make education *affordable* for the students by reducing their *Tuition Fees*, now a lot of times parents and students consider that a Domestic Scholarship would be the same as an International Scholarship, but to understand the difference between them, consider yourself applying for an education in your own country with the help of a scholarship. Now after the scholarship when your tuition fee would be reduced, eventually your entire cost of education would be reduced because being a citizen of the country, you wouldn't be required to spend any fees on Accommodation and feeding separately since in that case, students would be staying with their families. However, if I personally plan to study in Zimbabwe with the same scholarship, I would have to incur some costs on Accommodation and Feeding because I am not a Zimbabwean Citizen. So a lot of times parents and students consider International Scholarship and Domestic Scholarship one and the same thing, but in reality, they aren't.

Sponsorships, on the other hand, take care entirely of a student's education, but because Sponsorships are provided by only a few organizations, there are a lot of terms and conditions which a student might need to follow in order to get the sponsorship, the most common term is that a student after completion of the course would have to work for the organization providing the sponsorship for a period of time.
29/12/23, 9:56 am - +260 771447063: Oh okay, so what does your company do between the two things you've listed
29/12/23, 9:57 am - Harmehak: Edoofa offers Scholarship, Malambo.
29/12/23, 9:58 am - +260 771447063: Alright
29/12/23, 9:59 am - +260 771447063: I thought it was more like a sponsorship
29/12/23, 10:00 am - Harmehak: Did you go through the same please?

50-100% scholarships on Tuition fee.
29/12/23, 10:02 am - +260 771447063: ??
29/12/23, 10:14 am - Harmehak: Yes please?
29/12/23, 10:16 am - +260 771447063: This is actually the first scholarship opportunity that has come my way, I just thought it was 100%
29/12/23, 10:23 am - Harmehak: I do understand,

I hope now you have a better clarity?
29/12/23, 10:28 am - +260 771447063: So what's the percentage of the scholarship you offer
29/12/23, 10:39 am - Harmehak: We offer 50-100% scholarship on tuition fee, Malambo.
29/12/23, 10:51 am - +260 771447063: So what's the possibility of getting a 100% scholarship
29/12/23, 10:55 am - Harmehak: Let me share with you
29/12/23, 10:57 am - Harmehak: Edoofa Scholarship Offers 50-100% scholarship on tution fees,

The final percentage of the scholarship will be decided after the University Sessions of an Edoofian after his/her enrollment.

The percentage of scholarships is determined by the following factors

1) Academic Excellence
2) Merit
3) Previous Experiences
4) Recommendations from Edoofa
5) Statement of Purpose(SOP) 
6) Extra curricular Activities

So the Universites will evaluate them to decide the final quantum of scholarship.
29/12/23, 10:57 am - +260 771447063: Ok
29/12/23, 10:58 am - +260 771447063: Alright
29/12/23, 10:58 am - +260 771447063: Thanks
29/12/23, 11:00 am - Harmehak: What else would you like to ask?
29/12/23, 11:01 am - +260 771447063: I'll get back to you when I have any questions
29/12/23, 11:07 am - Harmehak: Sure please
29/12/23, 11:07 am - Harmehak: Now can you address the question?
29/12/23, 3:06 pm - Harmehak: I am expecting your response yet again, Malambo?
30/12/23, 8:19 pm - +260 771447063: They are but I don't think financially cause they are not stable
02/01/24, 9:34 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

I hope that you all had a Great Christmas along with a wonderful start to the New Year!

I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
02/01/24, 9:36 am - +260 771447063: Sure
02/01/24, 9:38 am - Harmehak: Can you please elaborate regarding the same, Malamo?
02/01/24, 1:19 pm - Harmehak: Are we connected Malambo?
02/01/24, 1:32 pm - +260 771447063: I mean they can't manage cause I don't have a passport, no visa, the job that my mother has doesn't pay her good in order to support when I start.
02/01/24, 1:42 pm - Harmehak: I understand
02/01/24, 4:19 pm - Harmehak: Let me then close your application in such a case. Feel free to re-apply when you are both mentally and financially ready to come to India for your higher education. However, in case you come across any of your friends or family members who would like to study abroad for their higher education, please share the following document with them and ask them to read it. After reading if they wish to apply for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, you can share my number and ask them to fill out the application form and share the filled application with me.
