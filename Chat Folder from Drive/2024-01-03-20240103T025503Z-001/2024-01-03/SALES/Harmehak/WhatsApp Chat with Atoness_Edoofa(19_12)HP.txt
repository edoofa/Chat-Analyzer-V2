20/12/23, 12:23 pm - Harmehak: Well Atoness now as we proceed ahead, I would like to your thoughts on higher education abroad!

Do you believe it's a life changing decision?
20/12/23, 12:27 pm - +27 64 981 6126: I do believe so .
Growing up I had always wanted to study abroad, and if I can have an opportunity to do so ,

It's a pleasure to know about them all.
20/12/23, 2:54 pm - Harmehak: So Atoness, may I have a better understanding to who would be the one supporting you financially and what profession they are in?
20/12/23, 3:05 pm - +27 64 981 6126: My father will be supporting me financially and he works under the metallic industry
20/12/23, 3:09 pm - Harmehak: Duly noted Atoness.
20/12/23, 3:10 pm - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!
20/12/23, 3:12 pm - +27 64 981 6126: Unfortunately,
I'm a student in South Africa and I was doing matric.

So  what levels do you consider for one to get a scholarship .
20/12/23, 3:57 pm - Harmehak: I do understand please,

Similarly for Grade 12, you must have passes in 4 major subjects, Atoness.
20/12/23, 3:58 pm - +27 64 981 6126: Okay , I understand, I'm confident about that
20/12/23, 4:15 pm - Harmehak: That's wonderful
20/12/23, 4:16 pm - Harmehak: Atoness, may I please have the list of subjects you appeared for in this term?
20/12/23, 4:50 pm - +27 64 981 6126: Mathematics
Physical sciences
Geography
Life Sciences
English Home Language

20/12/23, 4:54 pm - Harmehak: Received, Atoness,

20/12/23, 5:59 pm - Harmehak: Duly noted.
20/12/23, 6:00 pm - Harmehak: What motivates you to study Medicine , Atoness?
20/12/23, 6:12 pm - +27 64 981 6126: It's a dream , looking deep into the medical industry is makes one to find out more things about human health, I wanna discover the causes of certain disease and have more understanding about the human body .
Saving people's lives is one of the main thingd
20/12/23, 6:19 pm - Harmehak: I completely understand what you are sharing and equally appreciate your desire to help other, Atoness.
20/12/23, 6:25 pm - +27 64 981 6126: I'm glad to hear that 😊
20/12/23, 6:27 pm - Harmehak: So Atoness, what all did you research regarding medicine?

Along with the same what did you research regarding medicine in India and its requirements?
20/12/23, 6:34 pm - +27 64 981 6126: I know that medicine requires one to have high marks especially in science subjects, a lot of students tend to drop medicine because it is a bit challenging.
20/12/23, 6:39 pm - Harmehak: I can understand what you are sharing and that is quite true as well!

And what did you research regarding the requirements to pursue medicine in India?
20/12/23, 6:53 pm - +27 64 981 6126: Academic qualifications: To secure MBBS admission in India, candidates must have passed class 12 from a recognised board. Subjects studied: To pursue an MBBS course, students should have studied Physics, Chemistry, and Biology in their class 11 and 12.
One must be 18-25 yrs
20/12/23, 7:17 pm - Harmehak: I understand!
20/12/23, 7:17 pm - Harmehak: As you mentioned that it is your desire to study medicine, but it is very unfortunate that we don't offer medicine as a course because of the following reasons:

*1. Affordability:* Medicine is one of the most expensive course everywhere in the world, as it requires high-class facilities and great doctors and mentors to teach that.

*2. Eligibility:* As you would have seen from the video, that India is a great place to study for higher education as it has both qualities of education and affordability, but for medicine in India, you need to give an entrance exam named NEEt, which is very competitive and only 1000 students are selected from millions each year .

*3. Length of the program:* Medicine is 6-8years course including the internships that are mandatory, so it also contributes to the affordability issue
20/12/23, 7:17 pm - Harmehak: But I realize that you want to do a course that makes your parent proud and also align with your passion. So you can go ahead with the courses like

*1. Bachelor of Science in Cardiovascular Technology*
*2. Bachelors in  Pharmacy*
*3. Bachelors in Physiotherapy*
*4. Bachelors in Optometry*
*5. Bachelors of Science in Medical Lab Technology* 

These courses have lesser duration than Medicine and are more affordable for students.
20/12/23, 7:59 pm - Harmehak: I would have loved to continue, however I would be scheduling your session for *tomorrow at 9 AM CAT*, as my working hours for the day are over and it's already been a long day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*

21/12/23, 11:28 am - +27 64 981 6126: Ohhh this is amazing indeed.
Seems like graduating from universities in India van increase chances of finding job world's
21/12/23, 11:28 am - +27 64 981 6126: Worldwide*
21/12/23, 11:28 am - Harmehak: I am glad this intrigued you and you found it helpful!

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
21/12/23, 11:30 am - +27 64 981 6126: Nope, 
They are not aware
21/12/23, 11:31 am - Harmehak: Alright please
21/12/23, 11:31 am - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
21/12/23, 11:32 am - +27 64 981 6126: Ohhh I understand, that's why I'm trying to get the scholarship
21/12/23, 11:33 am - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
21/12/23, 11:33 am - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
21/12/23, 11:33 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
21/12/23, 11:36 am - +27 64 981 6126: Okay , I see that the Edoofa Scholarship makes it easier for parents.
21/12/23, 11:40 am - Harmehak: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $2000-3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, 

Now *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

What are you thoughts on the same please?
21/12/23, 11:57 am - +27 64 981 6126: I think that's a great thing indeed
21/12/23, 12:01 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

Now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program in detail and how it would assist you.
21/12/23, 12:01 pm - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
21/12/23, 12:01 pm - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
21/12/23, 12:01 pm - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

21/12/23, 12:08 pm - +27 64 981 6126: Okay I understand the EWYL Program
21/12/23, 12:23 pm - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
21/12/23, 12:55 pm - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

21/12/23, 4:48 pm - +27 64 981 6126: Yes yes 
I now realise that
21/12/23, 5:02 pm - Harmehak: That is great, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes. 

Are you ready?
21/12/23, 6:24 pm - Harmehak: @27649816126 ?
21/12/23, 6:35 pm - +27 64 981 6126: I'm ready now
21/12/23, 6:57 pm - Harmehak: Atoness, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
21/12/23, 7:04 pm - +27 64 981 6126: 1
21/12/23, 7:05 pm - Harmehak: I didn't get you!

Are you thoroughly following, Atoness?
21/12/23, 7:12 pm - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
23/12/23, 10:06 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
23/12/23, 5:34 pm - Harmehak: May I know the reason behind inactive participation, Atoness?

I believe you are going through the texts and not getting back.
23/12/23, 5:37 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
23/12/23, 5:37 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
26/12/23, 9:34 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
26/12/23, 1:05 pm - Harmehak: Hello everyone, I hope you are in good health.

Since the time you applied for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, I have been expecting proper participation, for your application for Edoofa Scholarship Program, but since you didn’t respond, I am afraid I will have to put a formal closure to your application. Feel free to connect with me again, when you think you are ready to proceed further. 

Below is a video explaining the details of the Edoofa Program

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1IDdUSWf-Q&t=590s
29/12/23, 8:16 am - +27 64 981 6126: Morning,I hope you are doing well.

The moment you mentioned those registration fees  being $300 per university and that meant like in 5 universities you hàve to pay around $1500-$2250 US only for registration.Those price indeed blew my mind.
I was worried if I have to continue or just stop because we can't afford that registration fee.
Then wen I thought about it,I was like maybe I just jumped into conclusion without further details about the Edoofa registration fee.
29/12/23, 9:35 am - Harmehak: Good morning Atoness
29/12/23, 9:36 am - Harmehak: How are you?
29/12/23, 9:37 am - +27 64 981 6126: I'm good and you?
29/12/23, 9:39 am - Harmehak: I am doing well
29/12/23, 9:40 am - Harmehak: While I understand what you are sharing, Atoness.

Was it anywhere stated that this is for students who apply with the help of Edoofa?
29/12/23, 9:41 am - +27 64 981 6126: No
29/12/23, 9:42 am - Harmehak: So don't you believe first you should have shared your queries with me rather than ignoring the message?

I believe you are aware that the responses are being evaluated, isn't it?
29/12/23, 9:43 am - +27 64 981 6126: I wasn't aware.
29/12/23, 9:43 am - Harmehak: Do you recall the same?
29/12/23, 9:44 am - +27 64 981 6126: Ohhh yes ,
I see
29/12/23, 9:45 am - Harmehak: Yes please!
29/12/23, 9:45 am - Harmehak: I believe so far I have assisted you thoroughly with your queries, isn't it?
29/12/23, 9:46 am - +27 64 981 6126: Yes ,it is
29/12/23, 9:48 am - Harmehak: So may I know why you didn't share your query with me earlier even if you were confused, Atoness?
29/12/23, 9:50 am - +27 64 981 6126: Just felt the pressure of thinking more about the costs and thought that I might not be the strong candidate for this opportunity
29/12/23, 9:53 am - Harmehak: I do understand, Atoness.

I appreciate you sharing the same once you realised.
29/12/23, 9:54 am - +27 64 981 6126: Yahh, I'm sorry about that
29/12/23, 9:54 am - Harmehak: I do understand
29/12/23, 9:54 am - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
29/12/23, 9:55 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
29/12/23, 9:55 am - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
29/12/23, 9:59 am - +27 64 981 6126: So you pay this amount after being accepted in universities or before
29/12/23, 10:01 am - +27 64 981 6126: I guess I get that.It sounds better indeed
29/12/23, 10:01 am - Harmehak: You see Atoness, Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
29/12/23, 10:01 am - Harmehak: $350 is paid only after/if you receive an acceptance letter.
29/12/23, 10:02 am - +27 64 981 6126: Okay,
I understand
29/12/23, 10:03 am - +27 64 981 6126: Yes I think so , so the visa application is also included fully in that amount?
29/12/23, 10:16 am - Harmehak: It's a one time fee of $83,

Visa assistance is thoroughly included in the the fee and your visa officer would be assisting you in with the entire process.
29/12/23, 10:18 am - +27 64 981 6126: Okay 
So what about the flying tickets? 
Do students sort out their transport themselves?
29/12/23, 10:18 am - Harmehak: I shall brief you about the same too.
29/12/23, 10:18 am - +27 64 981 6126: Okay
29/12/23, 10:20 am - Harmehak: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

Phase 3: Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.
29/12/23, 10:20 am - Harmehak: *However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
29/12/23, 10:25 am - +27 64 981 6126: Okay I understand.
But I still want to know about money for traveling to India
29/12/23, 10:35 am - Harmehak: I will brief you please.
29/12/23, 10:36 am - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
29/12/23, 10:36 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
29/12/23, 10:37 am - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in their country itself.
29/12/23, 10:37 am - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
29/12/23, 10:39 am - +27 64 981 6126: I do understand
29/12/23, 10:51 am - Harmehak: Alright please
29/12/23, 10:51 am - Harmehak: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
29/12/23, 10:51 am - Harmehak: Basically, this registration fee ($500-$1000) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024-2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
29/12/23, 10:51 am - Harmehak: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*

Here is a picture of the Visa of one of the Edoofian who arrived in India, for 2023 Academic Intake.
29/12/23, 10:51 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
29/12/23, 10:54 am - +27 64 981 6126: And this visa will be renewed yearly?
29/12/23, 11:00 am - Harmehak: It is renewed only once after you are in India for the entire duration
29/12/23, 11:02 am - +27 64 981 6126: Okay ,I understand
29/12/23, 11:08 am - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
29/12/23, 11:08 am - Harmehak: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)
29/12/23, 11:08 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
29/12/23, 11:11 am - Harmehak: While she is Zimbabwe, I believe you can still connect with her and have a better clarity.
29/12/23, 1:04 pm - +27 64 981 6126: Indeed
29/12/23, 1:05 pm - Harmehak: If you understand the concept of international education finances that play a major role are not visa fees and flight tickets. The flight ticket is required a very limited number of times as the students don't travel that often. I don't mean to say that students can not go back to their country, they can definitely go back to enjoy the holidays. What I have personally seen is, the students do not travel that often.
So, considering the main finance which plays the most important role in international education is the annual fees. So, to reduce this annual fee, Edoofa helps a student with the Earn While You Learn Program. This program provides the students with an opportunity to earn scholarship credits which in return help them to make their education more affordable.
Visa fees and flight tickets are to be bought just a month before they plan to come to India. So, let's say the student wants to come to India in August 2024, This means that his family has to cater the Visa fee and the ticket in July 2024. If you understand the concept properly, till July 2024, the student will be working in the Earn While You Learn program and will be earning Scholarship credits. Now, with this opportunity, you can save a lot of money on the annual fee which in return helps you to make your flight ticket and the Visa fee affordable.
As mentioned to you already, the scholarship covers the tuition fees as you see, the Edoofa scholarship is basically the scholarship seats acquired from the universities for their good work in the past 14 years in the higher education space. So the travel costs will have to be covered by the student, But our admission team assist you in all the steps. So that you get the cheapest air travel tickets and also easily acquire the visa.
The cost for both the visa and flight cost will be around $350-$450, But you need not worry about that yet as you will be coming to India in the month of July-August next year as per your preparations
29/12/23, 1:09 pm - +27 64 981 6126: Ohhhh okay I understand
29/12/23, 1:10 pm - Harmehak: So far, do you have any queries?
29/12/23, 1:13 pm - +27 64 981 6126: The EWYLP is a program that one does online?
29/12/23, 1:14 pm - Harmehak: Yes please,

You start with you are still at home itself, you would be alloted a dedicated mentor to assist you with your program and schedule.
29/12/23, 1:16 pm - +27 64 981 6126: Okay

I get you.
29/12/23, 1:17 pm - Harmehak: Anything else please, Atoness?
29/12/23, 1:18 pm - +27 64 981 6126: Nope

I think I'm satisfied now
29/12/23, 1:19 pm - Harmehak: That's great
29/12/23, 1:19 pm - Harmehak: Did you go through this video?

29/12/23, 1:46 pm - Harmehak: You're very welcome please
02/01/24, 11:38 am - Harmehak: Good Morning Atoness and dear parents, Hope you are doing well.

I believe you must have discussed all the above mentioned points with your family?

I am here to address any questions if they have any.

Are we good to proceed with your application now?
02/01/24, 12:31 pm - +27 64 981 6126: Yes we are good
02/01/24, 12:50 pm - Harmehak: How was your discussion with your parents, Atoness?

So far, do you have any queries for me?
02/01/24, 1:35 pm - +27 64 981 6126: Yes
02/01/24, 1:36 pm - +27 64 981 6126: The accommodation,
Is it available in the campus or a student has to find her own place?
02/01/24, 2:19 pm - Harmehak: Atoness, let me help you have better clarity about the same please

For us every student is like our family, Parents send their child for higher education on a belief that Edoofa Program will be there to take good care of their child during the course of their education itself, and because of that for us, student's safety and security is the utmost priority. Due to this itself, the student's accommodation is done on the University Campus itself, as the University campus is the most secure place any student can find, while their higher education itself.
02/01/24, 2:23 pm - Harmehak: Have you and your parents already had the opportunity to connect with Mrs. Ruth? You see, her story is truly remarkable. As a single parent, juggling the responsibilities of a small-scale farmer and the mother of two daughters, she has persevered. Her journey with Edoofa is a testament to how dedicated individuals can overcome obstacles.
Mrs. Ruth's experience with Edoofa is a testament to the transformative impact our programs can have. She not only managed her family's needs but also seized the opportunity for her daughters to achieve higher education. The support and guidance she received from Edoofa were instrumental in her success.
The process was challenging, yet incredibly rewarding. Mrs. Ruth's determination, combined with Edoofa's assistance, has paved the way for a brighter future .
02/01/24, 2:28 pm - +27 64 981 6126: Okay I understand.
02/01/24, 2:30 pm - Harmehak: Please?
02/01/24, 5:12 pm - +27 64 981 6126: Yes I did
02/01/24, 5:53 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

Did your parents connect too, Atoness?
02/01/24, 5:54 pm - +27 64 981 6126: Not really but I keep them updated
02/01/24, 5:54 pm - Harmehak: May I know why they didn't connect please?
02/01/24, 5:56 pm - +27 64 981 6126: They were busy but they know everything and willing to help me carry on
02/01/24, 6:06 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate their support,

However do encourage them to connect with Mrs Ruth as well.
02/01/24, 6:09 pm - Harmehak: Okay so in that case, I would like to ask you a few questions, but before that with immense pleasure, I would like to share the glimpses of the Africa Visit of our Founders which took place in June 2023! 

*It was a much-awaited event and they were welcomed by Ministries, Educationalists, Edoofians, and Parents across different African Countries. This is a must-watch video depicting the Acceptance of the Program in the African Continent, especially in Zimbabwe!!*

02/01/24, 7:29 pm - Harmehak: That's great
02/01/24, 7:29 pm - Harmehak: Okay so Atoness meanwhile, can you tell me:-

1. What is the name of the course which you would be studying through the Edoofa Program?

2. Through Edoofa in which country would you be pursuing your higher education?

3. What is the average cost for studies in that country without a scholarship?

4. What is the annual fee you will pay if found eligible for the program (yearly fee after Edoofa Scholarship)?

5. What is the enrollment fee of the Edoofa Program? 

6. If you are found eligible for the program in how many days you will have to pay the first part of your enrollment fee?

7. After receiving your offer letter from the University, you will have to pay your registration fee in order to finalize your university selection and reserve your scholarship seat in a particular university, this registration fee would be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same? <This message was edited>
