23/11/23, 12:29 pm - Harmehak: I am glad you had a thorough discussion, Rosemary
23/11/23, 12:29 pm - Harmehak: Well received, so, let me share more about the program with you.

You see, *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4000 students from different African countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
23/11/23, 12:29 pm - Harmehak: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program. 
We are associated with more than 200 schools in Zimbabwe. Some of the most elite Schools in Zimbabawe example in Harare we are collaborated with St. Dominic’s Chishawasha, Dominican Convent, Christ Ministries and many others. In Manicaland we have a total of 18 Schools to name a few St. David’s Girls Bonda, Hartzell High, First Class, First Choice and so on.  Chipinge we have Chibuwe High School, you would be happy to know that the DEO’s of Mutare and Chipinge have their kids under the Edoofa Scholarship. Masvingo we have 24 Schools collaborated with over 300 students from some of the best schools example Pamushana, St. Antony’s, Reformed Church Gutu, Zaka High and many others. The program is also appreciated by the Education Inspector of Bikita Madam Makomeke.We have more than 500 students from Mashonaland (West, Central and East) Province, Midlands Province.  Last but not the Least we also have Schools from Bulawayo and Matebaland South associated with Edoofa. 

Our collaborations with the UCE College Bulawayo adds a feather to the Cap of trust that Edoofa has built in a span of 14 years. 

The Schools, Institutions and Educationists who have made efforts to train the students for this prestigious Scholarship Program are also the Authorized Designatories of EDOOFA in Zimbabawe. 
We have Mr. Shorwi Kawadza (Retd. Headmaster Hartzell), Mr. Charles Jerera (Retd. Ministry of Education), Ms. Christina Rockson (Founder and Principal of Hilltop Christian College in SA) who have shown relentless efforts to guide students on the right path to success.EDOOFA boasts a proud students and parents community of more than 2000 from Zimbabwe who are happy with the quality of education and the employability outcomes.

24/11/23, 9:26 am - +263 78 290 4843: Yes we can start
24/11/23, 9:27 am - +263 78 290 4843: Good morning  how are you

24/11/23, 9:40 am - Harmehak: So were you able to go through the shared document, Rosemary?
24/11/23, 9:41 am - +263 78 290 4843: Yes i went through  but i wasn't  finished  yet
24/11/23, 9:41 am - Harmehak: I understand
24/11/23, 9:41 am - Harmehak: Well now that you have gone through the document could you please share with me-

1. Your understanding of the Edoofa program?
2. Your understanding of the financial aspect of the program?
24/11/23, 12:43 pm - +263 78 290 4843: I understand that the  Edoofa fully  funded scholarship is that these are the scholarships in which a philanthropist charitable organizations/Government  body sponsor a student completely,right from application to travel to education and living expenses.
Also you feel  your responsibility to educate the students that  there are a lot of organizations claiming to help students with fully funded scholarship under the garb of being a charitable organization.

Edoofa helps me by being a social,for profit organization which aims to help deserving students with life changing Opportunities to further their careers  through affordable  higher education as well as  internship  opportunities.

You also interview each student to look for deserving students so that  you can make them a part of Edoofa and help them make education affordable with  help of this grant.

This scholarships helps me to reduce the cost and expences  of higher education in India and this is a 50 -100%scholarship on the tuition fee. I also understand that the average cost of education in India for international students is  $6000 -8000 per year.
The other thing is that you value, which you look for in a student is the  right attitude and discipline. 

Edoofa encourages  students to  make an informed decision , considering  the logical and practical aspects of the education,also Edoofa brings excellent  higher education at an affordable costs.

Also your Proud Edoofians will be involved in the Earn while You learn program by learning various skills and then  working on projects that are related to the employability.

This Edoofa scholarship program understands that   through the earn while you  learn program ,students get an opportunity to not just get  trained but also to earn scholarship  credits.

And about Admission  process you have to know each other and to know about the edoofa program , getting counselling understand and build the career plan.


Lastly  i learnt about the students community that education is not learning of facts, but the training  of then mind to think and education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change  the world. Then i saw the photo gallery.
24/11/23, 1:21 pm - Harmehak: I am glad you thoroughly followed, Rosemary.

So did you discuss with your family too?
24/11/23, 1:22 pm - +263 78 290 4843: Yes we did discussed  with my family

24/11/23, 1:28 pm - Harmehak: Alright, that's good,

So do you understand the following?
24/11/23, 1:28 pm - Harmehak: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well.

However as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2000, simply after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
24/11/23, 1:35 pm - +263 78 290 4843: Yes i understood
24/11/23, 1:42 pm - Harmehak: And have you discussed the finances with your parents too?

 And like their school management
26/12/23, 11:38 am - Harmehak: I am glad this intrigued you and you found it helpful!

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
26/12/23, 11:38 am - Harmehak: I appreciate.
26/12/23, 11:39 am - +263 78 290 4843: Yes they are
26/12/23, 11:45 am - +263 78 290 4843: And we are familiar also aout the cost of the similar quality
26/12/23, 11:46 am - Harmehak: That's great
26/12/23, 11:46 am - Harmehak: Let me add about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
26/12/23, 11:47 am - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
26/12/23, 11:47 am - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
26/12/23, 11:47 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
26/12/23, 11:51 am - +263 78 290 4843: Oooh oky Oky  i have understand thank you bery much Ms Harmehak
26/12/23, 11:51 am - +263 78 290 4843: Ooooh wow thats amaizing  to hear
26/12/23, 11:54 am - Harmehak: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well.

However as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2000, simply after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
26/12/23, 11:56 am - +263 78 290 4843: Ooooooh oky thats great as well  and i would like to be the best student alsoo at your  school
26/12/23, 11:57 am - Harmehak: I appreciate.
26/12/23, 11:57 am - Harmehak: Rosemary, Senior Academician Mr Piyush were in Zimbabwe for about 90 days, from his experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,

While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time. 

This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year. 

Wouldn't you agree to the same?
26/12/23, 12:39 pm - +263 78 290 4843: Oky oky  noted with thanx Ms Harmehak
26/12/23, 12:41 pm - Harmehak: Wouldn't you agree?
26/12/23, 12:42 pm - +263 78 290 4843: I agree Ms Harmehak
26/12/23, 12:43 pm - Harmehak: Indeed, so now are you in a better position to relate how Edoofa is making higher education affordable and accessible for international students in India, Rosemary?
26/12/23, 12:45 pm - +263 78 290 4843: Ok
26/12/23, 12:47 pm - Harmehak: It's a question, Rosemary!

Are you thoroughly following?
26/12/23, 3:25 pm - Harmehak: Have you followed the discussion so far, Mrs Grace?
26/12/23, 3:52 pm - Harmehak: @263788821704 ?
26/12/23, 5:27 pm - Harmehak: I am expecting to hear from you Rosemary,

Do you wish to complete the counseling session?
26/12/23, 5:28 pm - +263 78 290 4843: Um sorry my phone just switched off whilist i was on this counseling  session so i had to put in on the charger to gain the battery
26/12/23, 5:29 pm - +263 78 290 4843: But i can now answer  your question
26/12/23, 5:29 pm - Harmehak: I do understand
26/12/23, 5:29 pm - Harmehak: Sure please
26/12/23, 5:32 pm - +263 78 290 4843: Edoofa is a platform that helps international students access higher education in India. the platform makes higher education more affordable and accessible, such as by providing information about scholarships, financial aid, and study options.  Edoofa is dedicated to making higher education accessible for all, regardless of location or background.😊
26/12/23, 5:34 pm - +263 78 290 4843: Regarding on this question  that is my answer above Ms Harmehak
26/12/23, 5:45 pm - Harmehak: That's well put across, Rosemary.
26/12/23, 5:47 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

Now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program in detail and how it would assist you.
26/12/23, 5:47 pm - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
26/12/23, 5:47 pm - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
26/12/23, 5:47 pm - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

26/12/23, 5:52 pm - +263 78 290 4843: Thank you for asking an important  question
26/12/23, 5:52 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate
26/12/23, 5:52 pm - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
26/12/23, 5:53 pm - +263 78 290 4843: Oky let me read first  then i will get back to you
26/12/23, 5:54 pm - Harmehak: Sure please.
26/12/23, 8:34 pm - Harmehak: I was expecting your response, now, I would be scheduling your session for *tomorrow at 10 AM CAT*, as my working hours for the day are over and it's already been a long day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
26/12/23, 8:34 pm - Harmehak: I shall hold your application after tomorrow please.
27/12/23, 10:01 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
27/12/23, 10:04 am - +263 78 290 4843: Good morning Ms Harmehak and everyone i am doing well as well thank youuu
27/12/23, 10:05 am - +263 78 290 4843: We can start
27/12/23, 10:05 am - Harmehak: Sure,

Have you followed the discussion so far, Rosemary?
27/12/23, 10:06 am - +263 78 290 4843: Yes Ms Harmehak
27/12/23, 10:06 am - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

27/12/23, 10:10 am - Harmehak: Alright please
27/12/23, 10:10 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
27/12/23, 10:11 am - +263 78 290 4843: I have seen all the students who managed to earn while learning thank you
27/12/23, 10:12 am - +263 78 290 4843: Yeah thats very true Ms Harmehak
27/12/23, 10:16 am - Harmehak: That is great, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes. 

Are you ready?
27/12/23, 10:16 am - +263 78 290 4843: I have heard persistance talking  about EWYL and he aslo said that his parents were happy nout him  and he paid all her tuition fee by himself
27/12/23, 10:16 am - Harmehak: I am glad you are thoroughly following the discussion, Rosemary.
27/12/23, 10:16 am - +263 78 290 4843: Yes um ready
27/12/23, 10:17 am - Harmehak: Rosemary, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
27/12/23, 10:17 am - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
27/12/23, 10:20 am - +263 78 290 4843: If a student applies to five universities and each application costs between $300 and $450, the total cost of applying to those universities would range from $1,500 to $2,250. Of course, these are just estimates, and the actual cost may vary depending on the specific universities and application fees.
27/12/23, 10:24 am - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
27/12/23, 10:24 am - Harmehak: This message was deleted
27/12/23, 10:24 am - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
27/12/23, 10:25 am - Harmehak: You see, Rosemary, Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
27/12/23, 10:28 am - +263 78 290 4843: Yeah thats what i think also Ms Harmehak
27/12/23, 10:29 am - Harmehak: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their O-Level result is out).

Phase 3: Once the final O level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.
27/12/23, 10:29 am - Harmehak: *However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
27/12/23, 10:29 am - Harmehak: I appreciate.
27/12/23, 10:35 am - +263 78 290 4843: Ooooh oky oky i understand
27/12/23, 10:35 am - +263 78 290 4843: Oky Ms Harmehak  i have read all the  information
27/12/23, 10:37 am - Harmehak: That's great, Rosemary!
27/12/23, 10:38 am - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
27/12/23, 10:38 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
27/12/23, 10:38 am - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in their country itself.
27/12/23, 10:38 am - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
27/12/23, 10:43 am - +263 78 290 4843: Oky
27/12/23, 10:45 am - +263 78 290 4843: Yes i have understood  Ms Harmehak
27/12/23, 10:48 am - Harmehak: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
27/12/23, 10:48 am - Harmehak: Basically, this registration fee ($500-$1000) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024-2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
27/12/23, 10:48 am - Harmehak: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*

Here is a picture of the Visa of one of the Edoofian who arrived in India, for 2023 Academic Intake.

27/12/23, 10:58 am - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
27/12/23, 10:58 am - Harmehak: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)

27/12/23, 11:42 am - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
27/12/23, 11:42 am - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
27/12/23, 11:42 am - Harmehak: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

Your scholarship journey is reaching a crucial juncture. *Tomorrow, on “28-12-23” at 10:30 P.M. CAT,* I will meticulously evaluate your application. This session is not just about answering your questions; it includes a vital Eligibility Check Interview.

We strongly recommend parents/guardians join, recognizing that higher education is a family decision. Prepare for a series of interviews, marking a significant phase in finalizing your scholarship application. As your counselor, I wish you the very best. It's been a pleasure guiding you through your career sessions.

If you qualify for the interview, *Senior Career Counselor Mr Sahil would be getting in touch*, we look forward to welcoming you to India. Please be proactive, as everyone's time is valuable. The Senior Counselor and Director will make decisions based on your interview and adhere strictly to the given time. Follow instructions diligently, and if the session is completed within the allotted time, your application will proceed.

Happy Family Discussion!
