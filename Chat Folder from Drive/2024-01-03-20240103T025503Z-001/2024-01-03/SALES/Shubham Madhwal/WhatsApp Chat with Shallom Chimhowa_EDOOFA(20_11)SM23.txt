Edoofa Scholarship Program is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4500 students from different countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability is driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!
23/11/23, 2:11 pm - Shubham Madhwal: You know we have been helping students from the African nations and the SAARC countries for the past 6 years and in the short span of 6 years, the most common feedback which we hear from the students is how the Edoofa Program makes the higher education affordable through the financial aid and how it helps the students to make a financial plan to make sure that their dream of higher education abroad is fulfilled.

Basically, our motive is that by providing the SEELS (Students of Edoofa Earning and Learning to Success) initiative, we help our students in Planning and Giving them opportunities through which they can help themselves by self-sponsoring their higher education at the least annual Fee Possible.
23/11/23, 3:51 pm - +263 78 723 1295: Oky go ahead

23/11/23, 3:57 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Mr and Mrs Chimhowa @263732428998 @263773512301 
I'm sure you would be very much happy to be a part of your child's career counselling sessions. As we are interacting for the very first time, can you tell me a bit more about yourself, your highest education, your profession and what motivates you to support your child to study abroad?
23/11/23, 5:11 pm - Shubham Madhwal: <Media omitted>
24/11/23, 8:24 am - +263 73 242 8998: My name is Godfrey Chimhowa. I am forty eight years old having been born on 14 July 1975. I am the father to Shalom Chimhowa. We are both christians and we believe in God. I was from a peasant rural background and studied upto 'O' Level and passed.  I then proceeded to study at Mutare Polytechnic College for a certificate in Business studies for one year, and proceeded to study for a further two years and graduated with a Diploma in  Business Accountancy. I then enrolled for a Higher National Diploma in Business Accountancy which is equivalent to a Bachelor degree in Accounting. I also enrolled at Zimbabwe Open University and graduated with an Executive Diploma in Business Leadership. I then worked in various organizations as clerk,  and Accounting positions before I was employed by my current employer, a subsidiary of a government department specializing in taxation and customs administration. I was employed first as a trainee cadet and I am a Revenue officer. During this period of employment I have interacted with various students at the country's borders and airports as they depart to study abroad and also as they return. As part of my job and as a team I have facillited the smooth arrival and clearance of students '  personal effects such as personal clothes and baggage  as well there new acquisitions such as personal vehicles to enter the country duty free as part of free rebates granted by the government. 
This is when I first admired how good it was for a child to work and study well so that one can study abroad and still come back home to work for the good of the country. I was motivated most when parents, relatives and guardians would wait jovially at airports to receive their child who would be coming after a period away studying. The reunion was and is always fantastic. I wished that one day one of my child would be studying abroad and lift the country and world flag high as a good ambassador.  As today I have no doubt that my child Shalom Chimhowa will be a good ambassador. She is well behaved and she is willing to learn. We as a family will support her to study in the best way possible.
Her mother Charity is a nurse here in Zimbabwe. She has come face to face with the suffering of the general public as they try to access health care. We are united as we support our family to study and work hard. The Edoofa program is the best way to go for our child. Our combined income as parents will provide a better benchmark to support her even as the grant will be 50% or higher. Recently I have witnessed a rise in the number of students studying abroad and going to India in particular. In short I pen off saying godbless to all the facillitators and students.
24/11/23, 9:31 am - +263 78 723 1295: Good morning everyone
24/11/23, 9:58 am - +263 73 242 8998: Good day good morning

24/11/23, 3:52 pm - +263 78 723 1295: I was raised in a family of 5, 4 girls and a boy. My sister who is the biggest of us all is doing nurse aid and  she is followed by my brother who is now completing his degree in fuels and energy. As for me l'm still about to complete my A level next year and I'm in a science class. Last year I wrote my O level exams and l excelled with flying colours. As for the courses, l would like to do Biomedical engineering or BPharm. My parents are all well educated and both of them are employed. My father graduated and have a diploma in Executive Business Leadership and my mother have a diploma in Nursing. Both of them support me in terms of my school fees and they're all willing to support me up until l complete my studies abroad. I'm currently learning at Sakubva 1 High which is located in Manicaland province. As for fees we pay $200 per term. I also have two younger siblings who are all learning at a boarding school.

24/11/23, 4:47 pm - +263 78 723 1295: For the last 4years l learned at St Augustine's high where l did my O level. This was a nice and brilliant school where l gained a lot of experience with a lot of things. This school made me who l am today because of its descipline. I also gained experience on how to be independent and not only to relay on my parents on whatever l want to do since it was a boarding school. At this stage this was when l learnt to fix my own problems and to do my own agenders without my parents being involved.My physical state was also groomed since we were involved in a lot of sporting activities such as tennis, swimming and basketball which was my favorite. I also gained confidence in myself since we met different kids from different backgrounds.. A lot of subjects were done including Mathematics, French, English, Computers only to mention a few and Mathematics was my favorite subject. The fees there where a bit high and we paid $500 per term excluding pocket money and groceries. Not forgetting my current school Sakubva 1 high, Centre of Excellence . It is well-known for competing for the lst or 2nd position with its A level results. It only accommodate those who are serious with their school work and l am very glad with that. I have had a lot of experiences which inspired me a lot throughout this period.

I have grew up to be a girl child with principals and manners through my childhood and high school experience. I am now someone who is responsible and very careful with the decisions make in life.

And another thing that push me towards this career is that l  am interested in studying the living organisms around the earth especially humans and animals. I have this feeling in my heart that when l continue with this career field one day l will end up having my own surgery and pharmacy. This is what motivates me to purse this career field and also not forgetting my mother who is always encouraging and telling me the benefits along this journey.
30/11/23, 2:31 pm - Shubham Madhwal: As you are aware via the Edoofa Program you would get an opportunity to study abroad in a country like India which is known for its medical infrastructure and medical practices all over the world, Did you happen to research the course requirements for Medicine in India?
30/11/23, 2:40 pm - +263 78 723 1295: You should have completed the MBBS course
30/11/23, 2:40 pm - +263 78 723 1295: That's according to my research
30/11/23, 2:50 pm - Shubham Madhwal: if you would have researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which the Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A-Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*. whereas if they want to study any Engineering Course then they should have *Physics, Chemistry and Maths* in their A level mandatorily.

So are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way in order to transform your career?
04/12/23, 2:15 pm - +263 78 723 1295: I am willing to put my maximum effort and hard work in order to transform my career
04/12/23, 3:19 pm - Shubham Madhwal: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it
04/12/23, 4:17 pm - +263 73 242 8998: This is a good thank, surely it helps and transforms the lives of the generality of our students and families.
04/12/23, 4:33 pm - Shubham Madhwal: I was expecting your response, but it seems you are occupied at the moment, so I will have to schedule your session for *tomorrow at 10 AM CAT* as my working hours are over for the day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning. 

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above-mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*

11/12/23, 6:29 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Hey, I hope you are doing well.

I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons which I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship.

14/12/23, 2:01 pm - Shubham Madhwal: You too can achieve all of such success if you decide to give it all, once you come to India to complete your higher education
Because we at Edoofa believe in providing the best to our students, the simple reasoning is that our philosophy is providing Quality Higher Education to a student that will lead to employment in the foreseeable future. 

Now that you are aware, That is why we recommend India for your higher education, Can you explain why you want to study abroad and not in your native country?
14/12/23, 2:24 pm - +263 78 723 1295: Studying abroad is one of my dreams l would like to achieve. Studying abroad will be an added advantage because you will get a lot of job opportunities and courses around the world. Also l have noticed that it only takes a few less years to complete your studies as compared to may native country that's why l prefer studying abroad to my country.
14/12/23, 2:24 pm - Shubham Madhwal: I appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country. In this process did you make any prior research on foreign education or applied to any University abroad?
14/12/23, 2:28 pm - +263 78 723 1295: Not yet but so far l had just applied online at Parul University
14/12/23, 2:28 pm - +263 78 723 1295: Asking about the courses they offer at their university
14/12/23, 3:32 pm - Shubham Madhwal: As you're aware of the fact that you'll be starting your higher education here in India, may I know if you've any Knowledge about the Cost of Education here?
14/12/23, 3:51 pm - +263 78 723 1295: I just had a little knowledge about that
14/12/23, 4:07 pm - +263 78 723 1295: $6 000 - $12 000
14/12/23, 4:24 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around $6000-$8000 per year*. Now while this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc, it is still beyond the reach of many. So EDOOFA works with universities to secure seats on scholarships for its students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.
14/12/23, 4:24 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *But, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year*. This cost includes:

1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)
2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)
3. Food
4. Accommodation
14/12/23, 4:24 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *To understand it better, the cost of $2000 to $3000 per year which includes the remaining cost of tuition fees, food and accommodation expenses will have to be paid semester-wise (2 semesters in a year) after the student arrives at the University.*
14/12/23, 4:24 pm - Shubham Madhwal: <Media omitted>
14/12/23, 4:35 pm - +263 78 723 1295: Thank you
14/12/23, 5:01 pm - Shubham Madhwal: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost nearly $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this, we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program*
14/12/23, 5:01 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Before moving on ahead, Do you have any questions regarding the information shared with you so far?

14/12/23, 5:12 pm - +263 78 723 1295: Oky l got it
14/12/23, 5:14 pm - Shubham Madhwal: So shall I now brief you about the Earn While You Learn  Program?
14/12/23, 5:14 pm - +263 78 723 1295: Go ahead
14/12/23, 5:16 pm - Shubham Madhwal: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.
14/12/23, 5:16 pm - Shubham Madhwal: The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
14/12/23, 5:16 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
14/12/23, 5:34 pm - +263 78 723 1295: The EWYL Program sounds so interesting
14/12/23, 5:35 pm - Shubham Madhwal: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

*1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-_*Africa Global Radio*_ - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

-_*Skooqs*_ - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
14/12/23, 5:35 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *2. Recruitment Partners: -*

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
14/12/23, 5:35 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *3. Webinars: -*

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -

14/12/23, 5:35 pm - Shubham Madhwal: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.

18/12/23, 6:29 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Hey, I hope you are doing well.

I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons which I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship.

19/12/23, 11:02 am - Shubham Madhwal: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
19/12/23, 11:39 am - +263 78 723 1295: I have found out that it is something different regarding what I was thinking
19/12/23, 12:04 pm - Shubham Madhwal: <Media omitted>
19/12/23, 12:08 pm - +263 78 723 1295: I have also discovered that Edoofa is a very good excellent scholarship program
19/12/23, 12:29 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Duly Noted please!
19/12/23, 12:30 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Step 1: It’s basically the counselling process with the senior career counsellor who will help you with the information related to the Edoofa Program and help you prepare for the Eligibility Interview
19/12/23, 12:30 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Step 2: It is the eligibility check process where you will be interviewed by the Program Director to examine your eligibility for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
19/12/23, 12:30 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Step 3: Once you clear the Eligibility Interview with the Program Director you will receive an Acceptance Letter from Edoofa. It is after this step that you have to pay the $350 enrollment fees Within the 7 day period of receiving the acceptance letter.
19/12/23, 12:30 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Step 4: This step is about the enrollment into the Edoofa Program.
19/12/23, 12:30 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Step 5: After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities.
19/12/23, 12:30 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *August 2025 intake, applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from the Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.*
19/12/23, 12:30 pm - Shubham Madhwal: This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 instalments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.
19/12/23, 12:30 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
19/12/23, 1:16 pm - +263 78 723 1295: This is the Edoofa cycle with steps one should follow to qualify or to secure a seat in Edoofa scholarship program. The first step is when one apply for the scholarship, you then go under counselling sessions with counsellers and your form will be submitted to the senior counselor where you will continue with your sessions. The second step is when you will be tested and you will go on an interview. After passing all these steps you will then receive the acceptance letter from Edoofa. You will then be enrolled into the Edoofa's program. The Admission process will then be done after the Enrollment into Edoofa. Lastly you will receive the Admission letter and Visa
19/12/23, 1:56 pm - +263 78 723 1295: Oky thank you
19/12/23, 3:38 pm - Shubham Madhwal: That’s great, So now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, a few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling:
19/12/23, 3:38 pm - Shubham Madhwal: 1. *Expert Career Counselling*: We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counsellors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.
19/12/23, 3:38 pm - Shubham Madhwal: 2. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save up to $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off
19/12/23, 3:38 pm - Shubham Madhwal: 3. *Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What's more, students earn scholarship credits in the process, thereby further reducing the burden of the cost of their education.
19/12/23, 3:38 pm - Shubham Madhwal: 4. *Higher Education Concierge*: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education*.
19/12/23, 3:38 pm - Shubham Madhwal: So which thing do you find the most interesting about Edoofa, from the points mentioned above and why?
19/12/23, 3:55 pm - +263 78 723 1295: The most interesting thing about Edoofa is that it offers higher Education Concierge. One thing l like the most about this fact is that you will be guided throughout the procedure until you reach your destination. This influences and encourages others who will be afraid of human trafficking since you will be going to a foreign land. Another thing is that it gives the students the zeal to continue working extra hard knowing that they have their support
19/12/23, 4:04 pm - +263 73 242 8998: To us as parents and guardians we value the fact that Edoofa program is affordable through guaranted scholarships as well as the Earn While you learn (EWYL) which will zero down to  affordability.
19/12/23, 4:09 pm - +263 73 242 8998: So all the points are very important hence it is very challenging to choose only one as the most.
19/12/23, 4:58 pm - Shubham Madhwal: That's really good. Now as I have mentioned about the various benefits that you get once you enrol with Edoofa earlier, did I tell you that a student also saves around $1000-$1500 in College Application fees when affiliated with Edoofa?
19/12/23, 6:49 pm - Shubham Madhwal: <Media omitted>
20/12/23, 10:42 am - Shubham Madhwal: Hello , Good morning, Hope you are doing well

As discussed, I am here for us to continue with your application, so shall we start?
20/12/23, 10:48 am - +263 78 723 1295: Morng everyone
20/12/23, 11:29 am - Shubham Madhwal: So before we proceed ahead ,Are there any questions yo would like to ask?
20/12/23, 11:46 am - +263 78 723 1295: You have answered all the questions we wanted to know
20/12/23, 11:46 am - +263 78 723 1295: So we may proceed
20/12/23, 12:20 pm - Shubham Madhwal: That's really good. Now as I have mentioned about the various benefits that you get once you enrol with Edoofa earlier, did I tell you that a student also saves around $1000-$1500 in College Application fees when affiliated with Edoofa?
20/12/23, 1:25 pm - +263 78 723 1295: Is it through the EWYL
20/12/23, 1:48 pm - Shubham Madhwal: And why do you like this point?
20/12/23, 3:49 pm - +263 78 723 1295: It helps you to save a lot of money during your journey of success. It gives students real time to have online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to scholarship credits which can be used to pay off a significant amount of their higher education fees and this is why l like this program. It makes us as students to be leaders in market.
20/12/23, 3:49 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Let me tell you For Admission forms, a student on average may end up paying *$1000-$1500*. For a Statement of Purpose (SOP), the cost is between *$300-$500*.
Edoofa also helps you with Visa Documentation, University Selection, and sessions, Seels Learning Centre (SLC) classes, etc, All these facilities would cost you more than *$2000* without Edoofa, but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad *for only $350*. This $350 is the Edoofa enrollment fee.
20/12/23, 3:49 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Please *The enrollment fee is charged to you for*:

1. Edoofa provides foster care to all its students. This is more like a family with health insurance, mentor assistance, and counsellor help. The enrollment fee includes the Application forms, SOPs, visa assistance, University sessions, etc

2. We offer a comprehensive training program on Employability Skills for the entire course. The Earn While You Learn Program, is a department where the child learns skills and also gets an opportunity to earn $50-$100 per month. 

3. The guaranteed 50-100% Scholarship we offer to our students.
20/12/23, 3:49 pm - Shubham Madhwal: <Media omitted>
20/12/23, 3:49 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Earlier the enrollment fee was $750 but due to this pandemic, we understand the problem faced so we have initiated the relief package so now the cost is reduced to $350 and is to be paid once you are found eligible for the program and then your earn while you learn will start and other parts then you can by your scholarship credits. The enrollment fees have to be paid Within the 7-day period of receiving this letter.
20/12/23, 4:06 pm - +263 78 723 1295: Oky go ahead
20/12/23, 4:55 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Basically, there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.
20/12/23, 4:55 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *Phase 2:* Once the student's complete Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).
20/12/23, 4:55 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *Phase 3:* Once the final A-level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents.
20/12/23, 4:55 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.*

20/12/23, 5:23 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Great, So now I will explain the entire process and the benefits that you receive once you are enrolled with Edoofa,

Once you enrol yourself with us, I will start your admission process and assign your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. After that, we will connect you with the universities to clear all your doubts and also if the university has any questions for you.

We have experience working with over 250+ universities and with that experience, you will have a proper admission expert assisting you with your admission. Edoofa's academic team will help the students to have university sessions to enable them to get admission via our scholarship fund. (This process also happens while the students remain in their home country and they receive letters from the University directly).

Once the university sessions are over, students will secure the Admission offer letter (LOI) from the respective universities based on Edoofa's recommendation at the end you will be given multiple admission offer letters from the top universities which are applicable for your course and hence you will have the freedom to choose the university in which you will pursue your higher education.
20/12/23, 7:01 pm - Shubham Madhwal: I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I will connect with you *tomorrow again at 10 AM CAT* to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind.

SECTION 2 READING TEST

Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage.

Like animals, one stands still, powerless to move a step in fright or to lift a hand in defense of our lives, and sometimes one is seized with panic, and again, act more like the inferior animals than rational beings. On the other hand, frequently in cases of sudden extreme peril, which cannot be escaped by flight, and must be instantly faced, even the most timid men at once as if by miracle, become possessed of the necessary courage, sharp quick apprehension and swift decision. This is a miracle very common in nature. Man and the inferior animals alike, when confronted with almost certain death ‘ gather resolution from despair’ but there can really be no trace of so debilitating a feeling in the person fighting, or prepare
d to fight for dear life. At such times the mind is clearer than it has ever been; the nerves are steel, there is nothing felt but a wonderful strength and daring. Looking back at certain perilous moments in my own life, I remember them with a kind of joy, not that there was any joyful excitement then, but because they broadened my horizon, lifted me for a time above myself.

Whey to Go Greek yogurt—a strained form of cultured yogurt—has grown enormously in popularity in the United States since it was first introduced in the country in the late 1980s. From 2011 to 2012 alone, sales of Greek yogurt in the US increased by 50 percent.

Given these solutions as well as the many health benefits of the food, the advantages of Greek yogurt Q5. outdo the potential drawbacks of its production.Sentence [1] The main environmental problem caused by the production of Greek yogurt is the creation of acid whey as a by-product.Sentence [2] Because it requires up to four times more milk to make than conventional yogurt does, Greek yogurt produces larger amounts of acid whey, which is difficult to dispose of.Sentence [3] To address the problem of disposal, farmers have found a number of uses for acid whey. Sentence[4] They can add it to livestock feed as a protein Q.6. supplement and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt. Sentence[5] If it is improperly introduced into the environment, acid-whey runoff Q.7. can pollute waterways, depleting the oxygen content of streams and rivers as it decomposes.

What is life in Rwanda like 16 years after the genocide there?

Genocide was one of the incidents that occurred in Rwanda years back. Genocide is the massive destruction of a substantial number of lives on earth and infrastructure. It leaves the nation or country in turmoil, tragic and devastating state. Millions of people will be displaced and the country will suffer from an economic crisis and breakdown. Women suffered from consequences of rape and sexual violence. Children became orphans while men lost their jobs. However 16 years after this genocide Rwanda started developing itself and new changes were occurring. 

The government and its members put their heads together finding ways to put an end to this tragic disaster. Now 16 years later Rwanda is now rebuilding itself setting itself apart from other developing nations efficiently and transparently investing and creating the building blocks of success in agriculture, social services, entrepreneurship and basic infrastructure. 

Rwanda has now improved its communication systems and also the road networks which were disturbed. It is receiving support from other developed nations and donors which is now raising its Imports and Exports goods around the world like usual. The vegetation which had turned out to be dead have replenished and the country is now evergreen with flourishing flowers and trees. 

Kindergartens, Colleges and hostels have been renovated and the learning process is now at its highest point. Not forgetting that Rwanda is now financially stable 16 years after this heavy loss and breakdown. Its medical facilities are now working and they efficiently improved which also increases the life span of its people. 



SECTION 6 PERSONALITY TEST 
My lnspirational story 

A thousand miles begins with a single step. This is what my inspirational story is like. I was raised in a family where education was the key to success and it was our everyday motto. Noone thought of opposing this because we could see a bright future ahead of us. My parents are all educated not with the highest standards but they did all their best up to the level their parents could afford. One thing l like about my family is that my parents are all  breadwinners and they all managed to achieve something better in life. This is what pushes and motivates me the most seeing my parents pushing me hard to achieve something big in life. They all inspired me to do something different and better in life. I am one of the happiest kid in life having parents that encourage and support me in things that are beneficial to my life especially the education part. I started having dreams of becoming a doctor when l was very young. I liked the fact that one would save millions of people by just giving them an injection and a bottle of medicine and l just told myself that l should be one of them. I loved being a doctor so much that l would admire my mom a lot since she works under that department. This made me work extra hard to achieve and fulfill my dream so that l would not stand a chance to loose my career. Little did I know that one day l would end up in the Edoofa Scholarship program having an sessions and an interview to fulfill may dream of becoming a doctor. May God grant me with this Wish

29/12/23, 3:56 pm - +263 73 242 8998: And the balance from 200 is to be paid in 30 days
29/12/23, 4:07 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Yes please, and are you aware of the transaction methods as well?
29/12/23, 4:55 pm - +263 73 242 8998: Yes,
29/12/23, 4:56 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Alright so, if you have gone through your Letter of Acceptance thoroughly, you must have seen, that there are two modes of fee payments mentioned:-

1. Direct Bank Transfer to our Parent Company's account
2. Deposit in our associate's account over there in Zimbabwe

May I know which mode according to you would be convenient, so that I can brief you in-depth about that particular mode?
29/12/23, 5:09 pm - +263 77 351 2301: Good day to everyone
29/12/23, 5:21 pm - +263 73 242 8998: Yes. ..the most convenient to me the one we deposit in the associate account here in Zimbabwe.
29/12/23, 5:23 pm - Shubham Madhwal: You see in the first mode, the Direct Bank Transfer Mode, the transfer charges which are to be borne by the parents of the student ranges between $80 to $100 which becomes quite high for a lot of parents considering the economic situation in Zimbabwe itself. So as not every student is in a position to cater for an additional $80 to $100 just as a transfer charge, the second mode was introduced, wherein, it is the Bank deposit in Mr Shorwi's Account.

So as you can see in the letter there is a Bank deposit in, Mr Shorwi Ex-Principal of Hartzell High School's account as he is our Associated Partner there in Zimbabwe
29/12/23, 5:23 pm - Shubham Madhwal: The fee payment can also be made through Hartzell High. School Ex-Principal himself. Since his account is a NOSTRO Account which only holds USD itself, *the necessary amount including the transfer charges in this mode itself would be 12.5% of the fees you are paying* the same details are as below:-

BANK NAME: FBC

BRANCH: Mutare

ACC NAME: Kawadza Shorwi

ACC NUMBER: 5333 0380 0918 0214
