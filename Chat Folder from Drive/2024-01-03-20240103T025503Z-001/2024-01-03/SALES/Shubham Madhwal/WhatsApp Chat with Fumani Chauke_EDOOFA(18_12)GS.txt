20/12/23, 11:33 am - Gurvinder: Noted, let me brief you about the program myself.
20/12/23, 11:33 am - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
20/12/23, 11:33 am - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
20/12/23, 11:33 am - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
20/12/23, 11:33 am - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
20/12/23, 11:38 am - +263 77 341 0203: Thank you
20/12/23, 11:39 am - +263 77 341 0203: Yes that is correct.
Thank you for the detailed description on the Program
20/12/23, 11:41 am - +263 77 363 4425: Thank you
20/12/23, 12:19 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so Fumani, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
20/12/23, 12:23 pm - +263 77 341 0203: Yes I would like to believe I meet these two significant metrics to potentially obtain a higher quantum of Scholarship
20/12/23, 12:25 pm - +263 77 341 0203: I am currently as Proactive as Possible in the counselling session and My Guardian is Currently active online
20/12/23, 12:26 pm - +263 77 363 4425: I am following in the discussion.
20/12/23, 12:53 pm - Gurvinder: Now Fumani, I would like to know you better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about yourself, your career aspiration do include sharing about:-

1. Your highest education level?
2. The course you would like to study?

20/12/23, 4:44 pm - +263 77 341 0203: Thank you for your advice
Law courses are favourable
...
I would kindly request assistance on information concerning employment opportunities...
20/12/23, 4:51 pm - Gurvinder: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.
20/12/23, 4:51 pm - Gurvinder: Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.
20/12/23, 4:54 pm - +263 77 363 4425: Thank you for the information, we pray for the best.
20/12/23, 4:56 pm - Gurvinder: So shall I breif you about the course?
20/12/23, 4:56 pm - +263 77 341 0203: Thank you for this very crucial bit of information 
We appreciate it
20/12/23, 4:58 pm - +263 77 341 0203: I am confident in my abilities 
The  information is very much appreciated
20/12/23, 4:58 pm - +263 77 341 0203: Yes please
20/12/23, 5:00 pm - Gurvinder: *Bachelor of Arts - Bachelor of Legislative Law* is a 5 year course which integrates Arts with Law.

20/12/23, 5:00 pm - Gurvinder: A course in BA LLB is an exciting one that offers multiple career opportunities. The 5 key positions associated with this course are:
*1) Legal Advisor*
The main role of a legal advisor or legal counsellor is to offer legal advice and work, for organizations and the employees of the organization. Their services can be utilized by the Government, NGOs, other associations or large organizations. The legal advisors are in-house experts, in contrast to attorneys and supporters who offer their services to society in general. It is often seen that legal advisors were former advocates and therefore their skills and training have to be in accordance with those that are needed for attorneys and advocates.
*2) Lawyer*
As is evident by the title, is a person whose profession is law. There are different specializations for law including Cyber law, Environmental law, Company law, Criminal law and Family Law. Their main job role is to represent their clients in jurisdiction matters. Their work involves a lot of research, including that on the subject and their client’s perspective. They then go on to represent and defend their clients in the court.
*3) Public Prosecutor*
A Public Prosecutor is a criminal lawyer who is hired by the government. He may either be hired by the central or the state government to represent the interests of the state in any criminal trial. Their role starts once the police have investigated and filed the charge sheet in court. The expectation from the Public Prosecutor is that he acts in the interests of the general public and is fair and ethical. The criminal procedure code of 1973 under section 24, outlines the arrangements concerning the Public Prosecutor.
*4) Judge*
This role is considered to be very prestigious by any law student. Immediately after the completion of graduation, an individual can appear for a lower judiciary exam. The age group depending on different states varies between 21 to 35 years. The qualities of righteousness, good ethics and a passion for justice are some of the key qualities needed for this job.
*5) Company Secretary*
This job is for students who want to work in the corporate sector. This job requires a degree from ICSI or the Institute of Company secretaries of India. A lot of dedication and hard work is required to complete this course with your law degree, but on successful completion, this career can be extremely rewarding.
A career in law is considered to be much sought after, satisfying and lucrative.

21/12/23, 11:17 am - +263 77 341 0203: I envision myself as a well-educated and renowned lawyer, which specialises in Company,Family and Cyber related law matters.

I find the idea of working collectively, bringing great minds together, and building a community fascinating.Weather be it in the Cyber,Family or Corporate side of being a lawyer.

I see myself as a good mentor/inspiration to aspiring lawyers, having a tremendous reputation and integrity along with the willpower to stand for the truth at all times. I have the dream of empowering young individuals with knowledge and financial support to achieve their goals.

The Edoofa Program's involvement  in the achieving of my dreams is crucial ,for it is the backbone on which it all rests.
The program would help financially and make the education necessary at least affordable
Alongside helping develop my skills in the law industry through lectures and real-time projects.
The program would also greatly improve my employability by providing me with work experience during the course.From my understanding the Edoofa program would also assist in promoting my growth and professional development. <This message was edited>
21/12/23, 12:49 pm - Gurvinder: That is really great Fumani I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations,

However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

Are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way inorder to transform your career dear?
21/12/23, 1:01 pm - +263 77 341 0203: I am willing to put 300% and go further beyond
I have big dreams and an even bigger will.
My dedication to this career  is unparalleled. <This message was edited>
21/12/23, 1:49 pm - Gurvinder: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
21/12/23, 2:20 pm - +263 77 341 0203: I feel that abroad there is greater opportunity and exposure
Plus I envy the quality of Education.
I feel the technology is much better/advanced such that it may assist me in learning.
Due to the skill and Experience you are willing to provide me with I feel I would be more marketable in the employment sector.
I also have friends who study abroad and are  excelling hence I admire and aspire to be like them. <This message was edited>
21/12/23, 2:38 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
21/12/23, 2:46 pm - +263 77 341 0203: I could be a resourceful individual to people interested in law.
I could share my knowledge in seminars and career guidance days.
I could be available for consultations for those in need of the information/advice.
I would be available for advice pertaining to law and possibly drive and stand for what is morally and lawfully correct.
21/12/23, 3:05 pm - Gurvinder: I appreciate your sense of hardworking for your community Fumani, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?
21/12/23, 3:11 pm - +263 77 341 0203: I strongly agree.
Everything Big or Small has a starting point.
21/12/23, 3:28 pm - Gurvinder: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
21/12/23, 3:35 pm - +263 77 341 0203: I agree
I have observed that India is much more developed as compared to other countries. <This message was edited>

23/12/23, 7:55 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

*“Strive not to be a success, but rather to be of value”*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
23/12/23, 10:04 am - +263 77 363 4425: Good morning
23/12/23, 10:28 am - Gurvinder: So now moving ahead by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India?
23/12/23, 10:35 am - +263 77 341 0203: Good Morning
23/12/23, 10:40 am - +263 77 341 0203: No we are not familiar with said cost.
23/12/23, 10:54 am - +263 77 363 4425: No,we are not familiar.
23/12/23, 11:42 am - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
23/12/23, 11:42 am - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
23/12/23, 11:42 am - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
23/12/23, 11:42 am - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
23/12/23, 11:42 am - Gurvinder: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*

*after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
23/12/23, 11:49 am - +263 77 363 4425: Noted, Thank you.
23/12/23, 11:50 am - +263 77 341 0203: Thank you very much

23/12/23, 12:04 pm - +263 77 341 0203: Yes please kindly go ahead
That would be much appreciated.
23/12/23, 12:40 pm - Gurvinder: Fumani, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
23/12/23, 12:44 pm - +263 77 341 0203: Thank you 
Very clear and Precise
The information is much appreciated.
Thank you once more
23/12/23, 1:12 pm - Gurvinder: The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

*1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-_*Africa Global Radio*_ - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4DAP24ZuY4&authuser=0
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0

-_*Skooqs*_ - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
23/12/23, 1:13 pm - Gurvinder: *2. Recruitment Partners: -*

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
23/12/23, 1:13 pm - Gurvinder: *3. Webinars: -*

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
_Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world_ by *Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade*.
_How to network like a boss_ by *Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi*
_How to be industry ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer!_ by *Ms. Yasmin Bitugu*
_It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship_ by *Mr. Ronard Kachaje*
_Decoding the science of personal branding_ by *Mr, Simon Maingi*
23/12/23, 1:13 pm - Gurvinder: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.

26/12/23, 8:34 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

*“The beautiful thing about learning is that no one can take it away from you."*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
26/12/23, 8:42 am - +263 77 341 0203: Good Morning
We hope everyone is doing well
26/12/23, 9:05 am - Gurvinder: I am delighted to hear that Fumani, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
26/12/23, 9:55 am - +263 77 341 0203: Thank you
The information is Much appreciated 
I understand that if a student were to work hard enough and earn enough credits
There is a possibility to cover 100% of the expenses
26/12/23, 10:15 am - Gurvinder: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

26/12/23, 10:15 am - Gurvinder: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
26/12/23, 10:21 am - +263 77 341 0203: Noted
I agree this is something highly valuable and crucial regarding international education
26/12/23, 10:42 am - Gurvinder: Alright Fumani, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
26/12/23, 10:47 am - +263 77 341 0203: True
My mother specifically
26/12/23, 11:29 am - Gurvinder: Okay so may I know if you have discussed international education plans with them in depth?
26/12/23, 11:35 am - +263 77 341 0203: We have indeed discussed international education in great detail and agreed it it probabtly best  with this scholarship program.
26/12/23, 11:51 am - Gurvinder: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
26/12/23, 11:59 am - +263 77 341 0203: Yes
26/12/23, 11:59 am - +263 77 341 0203: Ready
26/12/23, 12:11 pm - Gurvinder: Fumani as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
26/12/23, 12:14 pm - +263 77 341 0203: That would most likely cost the student $1500-$2250
26/12/23, 12:21 pm - Gurvinder: Exactly Fumani, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
26/12/23, 12:21 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
26/12/23, 12:27 pm - +263 77 341 0203: This sounds fantastic 
Considering the December 30 deadline is close, i would appreciate knowledge as to how soon can we pay?
Where?
And how exactly do we go about it
26/12/23, 12:32 pm - Gurvinder: Please let me continue, I will explain you everything.
26/12/23, 12:32 pm - Gurvinder: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
26/12/23, 12:32 pm - +263 77 341 0203: Okay noted
26/12/23, 12:32 pm - +263 77 341 0203: Definitely agreed
26/12/23, 12:34 pm - Gurvinder: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
26/12/23, 12:34 pm - Gurvinder: Fumani basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
26/12/23, 12:34 pm - Gurvinder: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
26/12/23, 12:37 pm - +263 77 341 0203: Noted thank you 
This does sound very reasonable.
26/12/23, 12:39 pm - +263 77 341 0203: I am wondering
Since I already have my A level results
How would the situation be handled
26/12/23, 12:44 pm - Gurvinder: You see Edoofa's exceptional program has opened up a world of opportunities for aspiring students, garnering thousands of applications on a daily basis. The Eligibility Evaluation process ensures that deserving candidates are granted the chance to participate in the program. *Once accepted, students are requested to pay a nominal Program Fee of $350 within 7 days of receiving their acceptance letter*, following which they commence with their admission process and the esteemed Earn While You Learn Program. Edoofa's mission to provide quality education and support to students is at the heart of this initiative, and we are honored to make a difference in the lives of deserving individuals through this program.
26/12/23, 12:48 pm - +263 77 341 0203: Dueally noted
We are honored to have the opportunity to associate with this program.
26/12/23, 12:51 pm - Gurvinder: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.

Are you familiar with the Edoofa Cycle?
26/12/23, 12:52 pm - +263 77 341 0203: No
Kindly go ahead
26/12/23, 12:53 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
26/12/23, 12:53 pm - Gurvinder: Alright Fumani, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zimbabwe itself.

2. In which country will your child be studying through the Edoofa program?

3. What is the average cost of studies in India without a scholarship?

7. After receiving your offer letter from the University, you will have to pay your registration fee in order to finalise your university selection and reserve your scholarship seat in a particular university, this registration fee will be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?
27/12/23, 9:57 am - +263 77 363 4425: I understand it's the $350 to be paid within 7 days once the student gets their acceptance letter
27/12/23, 10:27 am - +263 77 363 4425: 1) The course name is

6) The earn while you learn program,  is the  the initiative and backbone of  Edoofa scholarship program where students are given online live projects. From such projects, they gain work experience and earn scholarship credits which are performance based. These credits then translate to physical cash hence can be used to pay off their education fees their by reducing the amount to be paid by parents .

In other terms the students earn while they learn, hence they acquire skills meant to make them meet the 21st century job market demands.

SECTION 2 READING TEST

Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage.
If a person suddenly encounters any terrible danger, the change of nature one undergoes is equally great. Sometimes fear numbs our senses. Like animals, one stands still, powerless to move a step in fright or to lift a hand in defense of our lives, and sometimes one is seized with panic, and again, act more like the inferior animals than rational beings. On the other hand, frequently in cases of sudden extreme peril, which cannot be escaped by flight, and must be instantly faced, even the most timid men at once as if by miracle, become possessed of the necessary courage, sharp quick apprehension and swift decision. This is a miracle very common in nature. Man and the inferior animals alike, when confronted with almost certain death ‘ gather resolution from despair’ but there can really be no trace of so debilitating a feeling in the person fighting, or prepare
d to fight for dear life. At such times the mind is clearer than it has ever been; the nerves are steel, there is nothing felt but a wonderful strength and daring. Looking back at certain perilous moments in my own life, I remember them with a kind of joy, not that there was any joyful excitement then, but because they broadened my horizon, lifted me for a time above myself.

Sixteen years after the harrowing genocide in Rwanda, the nation stands as a testament to the resilience of its people and the transformative power of collective healing. The aftermath of the 1994 genocide left Rwanda in ruins, but today, it has undergone a remarkable recovery, marked by progress in various aspects of life.

Reconciliation has been a cornerstone of Rwanda's post-genocide journey. The government, led by President Paul Kagame, has implemented initiatives to promote unity and understanding among the country's diverse ethnic groups. The establishment of Gacaca courts, a traditional form of community justice, played a crucial role in addressing the atrocities and fostering a sense of accountability. The National Unity and Reconciliation Commission further facilitated dialogue and bridged ethnic divides, emphasizing a shared national identity over divisive affiliations.

Communities in Rwanda actively engaged in rebuilding the social fabric torn apart by the genocide. Grassroots programs and community-based initiatives encouraged dialogue, forgiveness, and mutual understanding. The result has been the gradual restoration of social cohesion, allowing people from different backgrounds to coexist peacefully. This communal effort has not only repaired fractured relationships but has also become a model for other post-conflict societies grappling with the aftermath of violence.

Economically, Rwanda has experienced significant growth and development. The government's strategic investments in infrastructure, education, and healthcare have laid the foundation for progress. The capital city, Kigali, showcases the nation's economic vitality with modern infrastructure, thriving businesses, and a burgeoning tech sector. Agricultural practices, a vital component of Rwanda's economy, have evolved through innovation and technology adoption, contributing to increased productivity and sustainable development.

Education has played a pivotal role in rebuilding Rwanda. The government's commitment to providing accessible and quality education has resulted in a notable increase in literacy rates. The youth, considered the future of the nation, have benefited from educational opportunities, with more students pursuing higher education and contributing to the country's intellectual and economic growth.

Despite the remarkable strides, challenges persist. The psychological wounds of the genocide endure, necessitating ongoing efforts to address trauma and provide mental health support. The pursuit of justice remains incomplete, as some perpetrators of the genocide still evade accountability. Balancing the need for justice with the imperative of national reconciliation poses a delicate challenge for Rwanda as it continues to navigate its post-genocide reality.

In conclusion, life in Rwanda 16 years after the genocide is a story of profound transformation. The nation has emerged from the shadows of its traumatic past, demonstrating that healing and progress are possible even in the face of unimaginable tragedy. Rwanda's commitment to reconciliation, economic development, and education has set it on a trajectory of hope and renewal. As the country continues its journey of recovery, it serves as an inspiration for the world, illustrating the indomitable spirit of a people determined to rebuild and create a better future.

SECTION 6

In the tapestry of my life, woven with threads of various experiences and challenges, my inspirational story unfolds, shaped by a tapestry of personality traits that have guided my journey.

Communication, a skill honed over time, has been pivotal in building meaningful connections. Effective communication has facilitated collaboration, understanding, and the nurturing of relationships, making me a better companion on life's journey.

Adaptability has been my ally in a world of constant change. Embracing the ebb and flow of life, I've learned to adjust sails when the winds shift, fostering a sense of flexibility that allows me to navigate diverse terrains.

Discipline, an invaluable trait, has been the key to consistency and success. The commitment to a structured approach has enabled me to stay focused on long-term goals, ensuring that I remain on course even when faced with distractions.

Reliability and responsibility have been my guiding principles in both personal and edicational realms. Being someone others can depend on has not only strengthened my relationships but has also instilled a sense of purpose and duty.

Loyalty, a quality deeply ingrained in my character, has fostered enduring connections. Whether in friendships or partnerships, loyalty has been the glue that binds me to others, creating a support system built on trust.

Humility and authenticity have shaped my interactions with the world. Acknowledging that there is always room for growth and embracing my true self has allowed me to connect with others on a genuine level.

Passion, the driving force behind my pursuits, has infused meaning into every endeavor. Whether in work or personal projects, passion has been the fire that propels me forward, turning ordinary tasks into extraordinary achievements.

Patience, a virtue cultivated over time, has been my guide in the face of uncertainty. Understanding that some journeys require time and effort has allowed me to navigate challenges with a composed and steady demeanor.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
