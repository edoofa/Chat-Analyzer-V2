You can address me as Mr Gurvinder, we do have Mr Shubham, Senior Academician and  Mr Jyotishman, Head of Admissions who will be evaluating your responses for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
28/12/23, 1:55 pm - +263 78 355 5813: Thank you very much sir

My mother is at work now so he won't be able to respond at the moment
28/12/23, 1:57 pm - Gurvinder: Noted.
28/12/23, 1:57 pm - Gurvinder: Alright, so Sharmaine, I can see you got to know about the Edoofa Program from Munyaradzi, is that correct?
28/12/23, 1:58 pm - +263 78 355 5813: Yes thats correct
28/12/23, 2:00 pm - Gurvinder: Okay, so can you tell me what all did you learn about the Edoofa Program from Munyaradzi, also do tell me whether you learnt about Munyaradzi’s Journey and Experience with the Edoofa Program?
28/12/23, 2:11 pm - +263 78 355 5813: I learnt that The Edoofa Scholarship Program can help make that dream a reality. That it's a program is designed to support young people from all backgrounds in accessing quality education, and it can open up a world of opportunities for you.
With this scholarship, you can access some of the best universities in India, gain new skills and knowledge, and build a bright future for yourself.
28/12/23, 2:15 pm - Gurvinder: That is correct, let me brief you more about the program.
28/12/23, 2:15 pm - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
28/12/23, 2:15 pm - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
28/12/23, 2:15 pm - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
28/12/23, 2:15 pm - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
28/12/23, 2:18 pm - +263 78 355 5813: Yes that is so Mr Gurvinder
28/12/23, 2:20 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so Sharmaine, as we start your counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
28/12/23, 2:22 pm - +263 78 355 5813: Yes l believe so
28/12/23, 2:27 pm - Gurvinder: Now Sharmaine, I would like to know you better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about yourself, your career aspiration do include sharing about:-

28/12/23, 4:19 pm - +263 78 868 2033: I loved electrical engineering because electrical engineers work in high-stake environments, they may face intense job pressure. They may also spend more hours at work meeting deadlines and completing their projects. Although electrical engineers may have excellent salary prospects, they often receive limited job growth. <This message was edited>
28/12/23, 4:28 pm - +263 78 868 2033: In accounting, helping people solve their problems and achieve their business goals is a pretty rewarding way to spend my time.

Personal development and aspiration, intellectual growth and personal interest in accounting 
I also enjoy working with financial reports in my daily work and the constant learning aspect that comes with working in accounting for example enjoying using mathematics and the skills that come along with a math-focused career. 
Accountants make up the backbone of every business and make a great career choice in terms of security and pay.

However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

Are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way inorder to transform your career dear?
29/12/23, 1:55 pm - +263 78 355 5813: Yes we are

29/12/23, 2:11 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
29/12/23, 2:12 pm - +263 78 868 2033: Moving to a different continent for school is a big decision especially for me, but it can be an incredible opportunity to experience a new culture and learn about the world. And a scholarship is a wonderful way to make this experience possible. For me, it can provide a unique cultural experience and the opportunity to learn about different cultures and ways of life. Studying abroad can also improve my language skills and give me a more global perspective. Additionally, it can expand my professional network and make me more competitive in the job market. India especially, is home to some of the best universities in the world, like the Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs). These schools offer high-quality education and are renowned for their research and innovation. And finally, India is a culturally rich country with a long history and diverse culture, which can be a valuable part of the educational experience.
29/12/23, 2:14 pm - Gurvinder: Please address this too.

I could also share my experience of living and studying in a different culture, which could help to promote intercultural understanding and communication skills. Additionally, l could act as a role model for other students, showing them that it's possible to pursue their dreams and make a difference in the world.
29/12/23, 2:19 pm - Gurvinder: I appreciate your sense of hardworking for your community Shantel, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?

02/01/24, 8:00 pm - Gurvinder: Hi Dear, I hope you are doing well.

I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons that I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship. 

I hope to get a positive response from you soon.
