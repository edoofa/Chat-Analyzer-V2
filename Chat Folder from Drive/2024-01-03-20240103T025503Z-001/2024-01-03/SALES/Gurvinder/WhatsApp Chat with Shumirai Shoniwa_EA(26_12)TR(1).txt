28/12/23, 11:04 am - Tushti: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher  education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?

9. Name of your school and the province in which it is located
28/12/23, 12:03 pm - +263 77 544 7266: I'm Shumirai Shoniwa a former student at Kutama Day High School located Zvimba , Mashonaland  West Province ,Zimbabwe. I was raised by maternal grandmother  in Zvimba rural area. My mother passed away  when l was at a very tender age , at the age of 3.My greatest strength is that I can prioritize what needs to be done first today and which tasks can wait until tomorrow. Because of this, I’m efficient with my time management and able to succeed in both school and extracurricular activities. However, my greatest weakness is that I can become too focused on one task and forget about other assignments or projects which need attention. I’ve been working on this by setting reminders in my phone throughout the day. l enjoy netball because that was my sport at school
28/12/23, 12:31 pm - +263 77 544 7266: 1. Name of school: Kutama Day High School 
Location:   Mashonaland West Province 
2. Educational level:  Ordinary level and Advanced Level 
5 Subjects at Ordinary including: English,Science and Mathematics 
Advanced Level subjects: history, shona and divinity
 3. Course to study: Nursing because it offers me an opportunity to help old peoples and children to live longer 
4. My parent is a vendor in a growth point named Murombedzi
5.My parents level of education is standard six. 
6.My grandmother and well wishers are the ones who supported my education 
7. Yes l have siblings .they are at school primary level 
8.I'm looking for scholarships to support my education 
9. My fees per term was $50usd
28/12/23, 12:50 pm - Tushti: Noted
28/12/23, 12:50 pm - Tushti: Now, you mentioned you have younger siblings in school. I believe it must be quite challenging for the family to manage to bring up all the kids in a country with rampant inflation, whereby there is a fee hike almost every year. Are they facing such a situation?
28/12/23, 1:11 pm - +263 77 544 7266: Yes
28/12/23, 1:18 pm - Tushti: In that case, how would the family manage the finances involved in your higher education abroad?
28/12/23, 1:26 pm - +263 77 544 7266: My family will not be able pay for me to study abroad or put any money towards the studies for that reason I'm looking for scholarship to finance my studies
28/12/23, 3:02 pm - Tushti: Shumirai let me explain to you that there are two kinds of programs that provide assistance to the students because a lot of times parents and students themselves misunderstand what a Scholarship actually means.

*1. Scholarships*
*2. Sponsorships*

Scholarships make education *affordable* for the students by reducing their *Tuition Fees*, now a lot of times parents and students consider that a Domestic Scholarship would be the same as an International Scholarship, but to understand the difference between them, consider yourself applying for an education in your own country with the help of a scholarship. Now after the scholarship when your tuition fee would be reduced, eventually your entire cost of education would be reduced because being a citizen of the country, you wouldn't be required to spend any fees on Accommodation and feeding separately since in that case, students would be staying with their families. However, if I personally plan to study in Zimbabwe with the same scholarship, I would have to incur some costs on Accommodation and Feeding because I am not a Zimbabwean Citizen. So a lot of times parents and students consider International Scholarship and Domestic Scholarship one and the same thing, but in reality, they aren't.

Sponsorships, on the other hand, take care entirely of a student's education, but because Sponsorships are provided by only a few organizations, there are a lot of terms and conditions which a student might need to follow in order to get the sponsorship, the most common term is that a student after completion of the course would have to work for the organization providing the sponsorship for a period of time.
28/12/23, 3:20 pm - +263 77 544 7266: In that case I will apply for loan to cover expenses that are not covered by scholarship
28/12/23, 3:21 pm - Tushti: Are you sure this would be financially feasible for the family?
28/12/23, 3:22 pm - +263 77 544 7266: Yes
28/12/23, 3:24 pm - Tushti: Kindly share teh L5 and O LEVEL result pictures
28/12/23, 3:28 pm - +258 84 444 9829: Good afternoon Ms Tushti.I will sell my livestock to help Shumirai with someone of the things she might need at school
28/12/23, 3:41 pm - +263 77 544 7266: If l send it tomorrow will it be too late because I'm far from them
28/12/23, 3:42 pm - Tushti: Noted
