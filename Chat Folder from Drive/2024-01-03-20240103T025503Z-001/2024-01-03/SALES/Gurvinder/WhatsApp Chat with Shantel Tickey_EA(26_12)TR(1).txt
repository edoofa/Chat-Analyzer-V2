28/12/23, 12:34 pm - Tushti: Alright, let me give you a brief introduction to the Program you have applied for
28/12/23, 12:34 pm - Tushti: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees.

We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries.

28/12/23, 12:35 pm - Tushti: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher  education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
28/12/23, 12:36 pm - +263 78 865 0645: What motivated me to apply for this program was my desire and  dream to further my studies in a respected state and in particular, India. I have always wanted to learn in India for various reasons one being my admiration for its culture.
28/12/23, 12:38 pm - +263 78 865 0645: It is.
28/12/23, 12:50 pm - Tushti: Alright so, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction. In about a 100 words, please go ahead, and tell me a bit about yourself: your strengths, your weaknesses, your hobbies, and a detailed description of your family background. Also do share the following details:

4. What is your parent’s highest education level?

28/12/23, 2:24 pm - +263 78 865 0645: My name is Shantel Tickey. I am 18 years old. I'm an the second born child in a family of 4 children.  I have an older brother who is 20 years old studying medicine at the University of Zimbabwe (first year), a little brother(13) still in primary and a little sister(5) who does not go to school yet. My father is a truck driver while my mother is a house wife.

Currently I learn at Seke 1 high school which is located in the Harare province. I will be an U6 student next year and my combination consists of Mathematics,Accounts and Computer science. The school fees per term is 75 USD. My father has been paying for my school fees and will continue to do so in university with the money he makes at his occupation.

My strength is that I'm am quick to adjust to a new environment and I can socialize quite easily since I'm fluent in English.  My weakness is that i tend to be  a snow learner at times but when I get a concept it sticks with me for life. My hobbies are playing chess and reading novels. 

I am very passionate about programming so I would like to study IT or any computer related program.
28/12/23, 3:08 pm - Tushti: Thank you dear
28/12/23, 3:08 pm - Tushti: Now, you mentioned you have an elder siblling in college and a younger sibling in school. I believe it must be quite challenging for the family to manage to bring up all the kids in a country with rampant inflation, whereby there is a fee hike almost every year. Are they facing such a situation?
28/12/23, 3:10 pm - +263 78 865 0645: Yes they most certainly are.
28/12/23, 3:10 pm - Tushti: In that case, how would the family manage the finances involved in your higher education abroad?
28/12/23, 3:10 pm - Tushti: Kindly ask them to answer
