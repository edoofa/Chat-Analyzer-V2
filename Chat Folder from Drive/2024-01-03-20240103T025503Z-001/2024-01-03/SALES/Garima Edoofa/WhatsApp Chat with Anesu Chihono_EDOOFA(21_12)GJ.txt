Im a hard working student who has a passion in Computer Science. I learn at Presbyterian High school in Mhondoro, Mashonaland West. It's a boarding school and the school fees is almost 700USD rounded off.

My weakness is im an introvert and don't talk much to people I'm not comfortable with but I'm tryna fix it since opportunities like these requires me to be more flexible.

28/12/23, 10:04 am - +263 71 289 6741: Yes
28/12/23, 10:10 am - Garima Edoofa: Considering your interest in studying computer science, May I know why you did not opt for maths and physics in your A-level?
28/12/23, 10:23 am - +263 71 289 6741: So the thing is in Zimbabwe for one to get a degree in computer science he has to have at least Math/Statistics and Computer Science itself to be able to get a Computing  programme, Physics is mostly done with people interested in Engineering.
28/12/23, 11:04 am - Garima Edoofa: if you would have researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which the Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A-Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*. whereas if they want to study any Engineering Course then they should have *Physics Chemistry and Maths* in their A level mandatorily.
28/12/23, 11:06 am - Garima Edoofa: However, Looking at your passion for computer science we do have a course that would align with your aspirations, would you want me to brief you about the course?
28/12/23, 11:07 am - +263 71 289 6741: Yessir
28/12/23, 11:08 am - +263 71 289 6741: <Media omitted>
28/12/23, 11:24 am - Garima Edoofa: I would love to continue with our discussion, however, it is my lunch break and we'll be connecting shortly after One Hour.
