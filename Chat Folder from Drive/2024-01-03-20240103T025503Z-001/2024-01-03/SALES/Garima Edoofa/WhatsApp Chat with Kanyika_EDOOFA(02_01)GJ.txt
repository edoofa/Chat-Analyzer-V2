02/01/24, 1:51 pm - Garima Edoofa: You see, Edoofa Scholarship Program is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4000 students from different African countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!
02/01/24, 1:51 pm - Garima Edoofa: EDOOFA has praised the new government for its strong commitment and positive reforms in the education sector.

The elimination of school fees, increase in the number of teachers, and keeping vulnerable learners, especially adolescent girls, in school are some of the notable positive reforms.

EDOOFA is deeply honored to support the government in its endeavor to transform the education sector to achieve Sustainable Development which seeks to ensure inclusive and equitable quality education between now and 2030.

After our successful visit to Zambia and meetings at the Ministries, we have already begun conducting Scholarship Tests and Counseling Sessions at eminent schools in Zambia.

Also, Edoofa is looking for deserving candidates who are meritorious and seek affordable education in the world’s second-largest higher education space.

Our strong partnerships with educational institutions like Penmal Connect Ltd., and Trident College from Zambia have paved the way for numerous success stories along with various institutions like Kamulanga High, Canisius Secondary, National Hillcrest, Matero Boys Secondary, etc! We are also connected with the likes of Njase, Ndola Girls, Fatima Secondary, Torbit, and Zambezi Boarding among many others to 
offer, build and extend the opportunity of the Edoofa Scholarship Program to more and more deserving students across Zambia.

I would like to know you better as a student so please go ahead, tell me a bit about yourself, your education, what course you would like to study, how much was your every term fee, along with what you wish to study, your strengths and weaknesses, and your hobbies, since I honestly don't know a lot about you?

And with that a detailed description of your family background, what do your parents do (Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work)?, what is their highest education level along with if you have any siblings, please?

02/01/24, 3:30 pm - +260 96 7440640: Alright madam my full names are Bonex Kanyika am an orphan I  stay with my mother and two brothers am the last born and I sat for my grade 12 examinations that am waiting for the results.Further more,I would like to study civil engineering,my every team fee was k1000.Am good in mathematics and science 
My siblings both of them have completed school but did not go to tertiary school due to lack of funds currently they are doing some piece works in order to help my mother to raise school fees for me <This message was edited>
02/01/24, 3:56 pm - Garima Edoofa: It is a pleasure to know about you and your family, Kanyika.

I see you are interested in pursuing this course. Can you please explain in detail what motivates you to pursue this career field?
02/01/24, 4:45 pm - +260 96 7440640: My motivation behind this course is that Civil Engineers don't repeat the same tasks over and over again. Each project is different from the ones before it, which keeps things more interesting and prevents boredom from setting in. Civil engineers need to work as a team to bring a project to completion. <This message was edited>
02/01/24, 5:02 pm - Garima Edoofa: I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you *tomorrow again at 10:00 AM CAT* to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind.

Have a good night
God Bless You!
02/01/24, 5:11 pm - +260 96 7440640: Alright thanks madam
