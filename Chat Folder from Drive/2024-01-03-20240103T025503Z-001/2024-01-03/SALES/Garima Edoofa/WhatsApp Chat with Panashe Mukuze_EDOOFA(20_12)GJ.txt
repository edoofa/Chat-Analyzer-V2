In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
28/12/23, 2:42 pm - +263 78 396 4437: Ok if I pursue my education through this scholarship,I think I can contribute to the development of the education system in my country through sharing some of the skills I would have learned abroad and maybe come up with an organisation that will help those less privileged
28/12/23, 2:43 pm - Garima Edoofa: I appreciate your sense of hard work for your community Panashe, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?
