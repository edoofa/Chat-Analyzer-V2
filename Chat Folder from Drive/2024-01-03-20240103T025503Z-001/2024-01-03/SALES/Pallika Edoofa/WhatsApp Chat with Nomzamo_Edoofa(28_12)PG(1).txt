28/12/23, 5:54 pm - +263 78 410 7432: I am Ngwenya Nomzamo , a student selected for the Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. Ofwhich it has been my dream to pursue  my studies  abroad due to the affordability  of fees and employment  opportunity as compared  to Zimbabwe where by the  colleges  and university  fees are expensive  as my parents  also struggled pay my school  fees during my days.And they can't  even raise that money for me to go and start my tertiary  education because  they are also paying for my younger brother  who is grade 6.

I attended  my Secondary  level at Bulu high where l found it enjoyable  to study fashion and fabrics thus where l gained more interest  to work as a fashion designer and also liked being a teacher because because  as a fashion designer  you can desion different  patterns   and sell,work as as a teacher  also l can open and operate my own company  maybe thus l will be aslo helping  my community by  exporting  some other clothes  to be sold  in my country  if its allowed.

Moreover ,since l had finished  my Secondary  level life has been stuck  since l have been applying  for other courses but not been shortlisted  for any.Therefore the fees now at colleges  rates to US $210per term which adds up to US $ 630 per year food exclusive, And to mention internet costs it adds up to $1000 per year.Therefore l find it better to study in India where by the fees are of less costs and has to access  to network the student's  education  is more  valuable. 

I completed  my A Level in 2019 where l did Geography,Economics and Business Studies,I would  like to do Teaching in Fashion and Designing.
My parents have  no professions as  my mother is just at home seated and my father does piece jobs in South Africa.My mother's  highest education  is form 3 in secondary level and my father in grade 7 in Primary level as  their parents  had no money  to pay for their fees.Yes l have got my sister who also do some piece jobs in South Africa to support   her 2 kids who are in Primary   level.Moreover my father is hs been so supportive  to me since l started my primary  as he has been doing  piece jobs to support  us.

It is my desire  to study abroad  and my sister is also willing and promising to be financially  supportive.Since my daddy in now at retirement  stage.And l also had a strong desire to support my family through part-time employment during my course,  which offer offers opportunity earnings  between $50 and $100.

Moreso,l attended  my O'Level and A'Level at Bulu High School   which is in Mangwe District  in Matebeleland South  province,thus where  my parents  paid a school fees which tated to US $190 per term to ensure  l had sufficient  internet

29/12/23, 12:45 pm - +263 78 410 7432: Yes l wish to be a fashion designer  as l once  consulted  the other teacher who  also teach it and she told me that its a good career  as you can also open you own company .Since l finishedmy A'Level l looked for work thus l got employed  at the shop  for a year where l was paid $40 and it wasn't even enough because  we also used it at home to buy some other staff like food  since by that time my sister and a brother were not working.

I was then seated at home all the time until l joined DREAMS  club  which is for girls whereby we where asked to choose  courses for ourselves  that was,building,carpentry,and Cutting and designing  thus l had to choose  cutting and designing.We were then told to go in Plumtree  where had our lessons for 6 months from June 2023 untill 20 December  2023.Thus the experience  l have about this career.

However,that wasn't  even enough  for me because we were too many and we didn't  find enough  time to learn more things because  we were going with others  pace.
29/12/23, 12:46 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Thank you for sharing this, Nomzamo
29/12/23, 12:46 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Nomzamo, I would like to know what specific plans and preparations you and your parents have made for your tertiary education abroad?
29/12/23, 1:01 pm - +263 77 938 6081: As Nomzamo mother's l always wished that maybe one will get money to pay for her in college.We then started  a business of selling airtime with her after finishing her school  but it didn't work as we ended up using it at home since the things were not well.
29/12/23, 1:09 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I understand that, Ms. Ireen, Please note that the Edoofa Scholarship offers 50-100% scholarship on the tuition fees and based on the performance and evaluations of our Academic Board, one can even achieve a higher quantum of the scholarship but the remaining cost after the scholarship such as Living and Transportation is catered by a student's family.  I will be guiding you through the financial aspects of the program.

Will you be able to manage the remaining expenses?
29/12/23, 2:59 pm - +263 78 410 7432: At this point  Dreams  and Yound Africa  Zimbabwe  combined  ideas thus we ended up leaning  under Young Africa Zimbabwe (YAZ)  and it took us the whole six month  we were paid for our fees

02/01/24, 10:20 am - +263 77 938 6081: Commercials,,,, Geography,Economics and Business Studies
02/01/24, 10:22 am - Pallika Edoofa: Thank you for sharing this, I want to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*



Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident for Nomzamo about achieving it
02/01/24, 10:22 am - Pallika Edoofa: And, As your evaluation progresses, I would like to appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country. In this process did you do any prior research on foreign education or apply to any University abroad?
02/01/24, 10:36 am - +263 77 938 6081: Yes l am confident for her
02/01/24, 10:37 am - Pallika Edoofa: Alright!
02/01/24, 10:42 am - +263 77 938 6081: No l  didn't do research and l never applied to any of the university
