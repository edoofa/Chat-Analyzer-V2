6/1/24, 1:36 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: In the same spirit, I would like to share that I am embarking on a journey as I prepare myself to pursue my doctorate and take a step forward in my academic pursuits. This transition marks a significant chapter in my life as I will be bidding farewell to the cherished moments at the Admissions Team in Edoofa.

Over the past year, having the privilege of supporting numerous students, including you, in your pursuit of higher education has been truly rewarding. Witnessing our students thrive and excel in their dream universities and colleges has brought immense satisfaction.
6/1/24, 1:36 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: The decision to transition to a new phase in my life presents an incredible opportunity for me to continue contributing to the lives of students, ensuring their academic journey and overall experience remain enriched and fulfilling.

As I embark on this new journey, I want to assure you that I have entrusted your application file to capable hands. From this point forward, your admission journey will be seamlessly guided by one of our accomplished admission officers, *Ms. Siddhi,* who will connect with you on Tuesday.  I hope you will make yourself available for further procedures and will give your best to your career.

I am *Ms. Siddhi Singh, Admission Officer at Edoofa* and I am honoured to assume the responsibilities previously held by Mr. Shivjeet. I will be guiding you toward realising your dream education with Edoofa. I am confident that together, we can ensure a promising start to your educational journey, leading to the right employment opportunities and ultimately, success for you and your family.
9/1/24, 8:13 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: In the past few days, I had an in-depth discussion with Mr. Shivjeet and had the opportunity to review your scholarship application file in our records. Through this process, I gained valuable insights into your dreams and aspirations to advance your academic career. Upon reviewing your application file, I was both impressed and reassured to assist you in achieving these goals here in India, which will unlock doors to incredible opportunities in the future.
9/1/24, 8:13 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Before we get into the specifics of your admission journey and talk about your admission process, I would like to share an exciting milestone that India as a country achieved within the first week of 2024 – the successful *India's Chandrayaan-3 Engine Test.* This accomplishment is responsible for the third lunar mission, aiming to land a rover on the Moon's south polar region and conduct scientific studies that could check Moon's viability to sustain life. It signifies a significant scientific advancement, laying the groundwork for future progress.
9/1/24, 8:13 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This achievement has not only pushed boundaries but also has inspired young minds all over the world to pursue their dreams. On the same note, I wanted to extend my heartiest wishes for the New Year to you and your family and check in to see how you and your family started your year?

10/1/24, 7:56 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: A new year brings forth a multitude of possibilities and fresh opportunities for growth and self-discovery. Though the new year itself may not bring immediate transformation, it marks a symbolic turning point, a chance to reflect and set new goals for ourselves. This year, I have decided to practise more compassion, learn at least one new skill, and assist students who were unable to proceed further with their admission process in 2023, guiding them to build their envisioned future.

May I ask what changes or additions you have decided to make in the year 2024?

2/2/24, 11:41 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: So before proceeding with the session, are there any questions you would like to ask?
2/2/24, 11:58 AM - +263 71 562 9680: Nop
2/2/24, 1:03 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Perfect, To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is B.Tech (Mechanical Engineering) and your intake is in August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information is accurate?
2/2/24, 1:28 PM - +263 71 562 9680: Yes confirmed
2/2/24, 1:34 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: As I have promised, the Edoofa Admissions team will be submitting your application to multiple universities that will evaluate your application and upon being eligible, you receive the offer letters with comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. *I will guide you to the best education institution/university associated with us that aligns with your vision and interest and would provide you with a conducive environment for your holistic development and to fulfil your career goals.*

Upon receiving the Offer Letter, you will have a few weeks to pay a portion of your university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. We discussed the registration fee during our counselling sessions. May I know, what do you recall about the same now?
2/2/24, 1:40 PM - +263 71 562 9680: all I recall  is that the registration os a fee which I pay to the university That have accepted me as well as that which I accepted to allow them to register my name in their database for the Fall of 2024 or as an ensurance that  serious about their university
2/2/24, 1:55 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Let me help you with a better understanding. *Usually, the registration fee is an additional fee apart from the cost of education but Edoofians receive an exclusive benefit where it is a part of the cost of education itself.* Let me give you an example:-
2/2/24, 1:55 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: As we discussed in the counseling session, the cost of education in India ranges from $6000-$8000 per annum which is reduced to $1600-$2300 per annum through the Edoofa Scholarship Program *as we recommended your application for a higher quantum of scholarship.* Congratulations on securing the same. Now, let us assume,
2/2/24, 1:55 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: 1. *Tuition Fee*: $1000 per annum
2. *Accommodation Fee*: $800 per annum
3. *Remaining Fee Components*: [Library Fee, Examination Fee, EDB and Book Bank, International Student Development Fund, 24-Hour WiFi Cost, Maintenance Fee, Water Bill, and Electricity Bill]: $200 per annum

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1000 + Accommodation Fee $800 + Remaining Fee Components $200 = $2000 per annum.

4. *Registration Fee to be paid:* $1000
2/2/24, 1:55 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: This means this registration fee will be waived off from the cost of education ($2000-$1000 = $1000) and this remaining fee of $1000 can be paid in two installments. The first part of $500 within 3 days after your arrival here in India and the remaining $500 will be due in December 2024, or before your second semester begins.

*Do you have any questions for me regarding the same?*
2/2/24, 1:58 PM - +263 71 562 9680: Understood
2/2/24, 2:44 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: The registration fee can be paid either in two equal parts(The first half within 15 days and the second half within 30 days) or in one go itself.

Are you clear with the details?
2/2/24, 2:45 PM - +263 71 562 9680: Yes
2/2/24, 2:47 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: So to get your University letter prepared,

6/2/24, 12:27 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: As we discussed in the counseling session, the cost of education in India ranges from $6000-$8000 per annum which is reduced to $1600-$2300 per annum through the Edoofa Scholarship Program *as we recommended your application for a higher quantum of scholarship.* Congratulations on securing the same. Now, let us assume,
6/2/24, 12:27 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: 1. *Tuition Fee*: $1000 per annum
2. *Accommodation Fee*: $800 per annum
3. *Remaining Fee Components*: [Library Fee, Examination Fee, EDB and Book Bank, International Student Development Fund, 24-Hour WiFi Cost, Maintenance Fee, Water Bill, and Electricity Bill]: $200 per annum

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1000 + Accommodation Fee $800 + Remaining Fee Components $200 = $2000 per annum.

4. *Registration Fee to be paid:* $1000
6/2/24, 12:27 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: This means this registration fee will be waived off from the cost of education ($2000-$1000 = $1000) and this remaining fee of $1000 can be paid in two installments. The first part of $500 within 3 days after your arrival here in India and the remaining $500 will be due in December 2024, or before your second semester begins.

*Do you have any questions for me regarding the same?*
