20/12/23, 1:39 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Greetings, dear parent and my dear student!

I would like to share an update with you: starting today, I will no longer be serving as your admission officer. I wanted to inform you that Ms. Ashi will be taking over from now on, and she will be reaching out to you very soon.

Over the past 12 months, I have had the privilege of serving as the admission officer for you and many other students. It has been a great experience getting to know the potential of my students and spending valuable time discussing their aspirations. However, every journey has its end, and now it's time for me to embark on a new chapter.

Rest assured, the exceptional service and support you have received will continue seamlessly as Ms. Ashi, one of our accomplished admission officers, takes over your admission journey from this point forward. I wish you the very best on your journey. Goodbye, my dear student.

Yours sincerely,
Mr. Shivjeet

Please excuse me for being late for the session today, as I was occupied with meetings with our affiliated schools in Zimbabwe and planning our upcoming seminar and scholastic evaluation meeting at Harare on the 17th of February, 2024. 

On that note, I would like to share with you that
*"Success is no accident. It is hard work, perseverance, learning, studying, sacrifice, and most of all, love of what you are doing or learning to do." - Pelé*

With all positive energy, I am here to continue our interactive session.
8/2/24, 2:16 PM - +263 71 889 4423: Good afternoon sir.
8/2/24, 2:18 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: So before proceeding with the session, are there any questions you would like to ask?
8/2/24, 2:25 PM - +263 71 889 4423: We can start,with the procedures.
8/2/24, 3:20 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Being a senior academician and counsellor, my aspirations for young learners like you are similar. I firmly believe higher education should combine the following for a learner to achieve their goals:-

Quality Education
Conducive Environment
Critical Thinking and Practical learning skills
Technological Literacy and Attachments
Cultural Awareness and Global Perspective
Career guidance, Mentorships, etc.

*However, not everyone achieves success. Do you know why*?
8/2/24, 3:23 PM - +263 71 889 4423: Why?
8/2/24, 3:28 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
8/2/24, 3:28 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: The Irony is “The masses have never thirsted after truth. Whoever can supply them with illusions is easily their master; We are still indecisive because we are following the opinions and different perspectives, NOT introspecting the Fact and Truth.
8/2/24, 3:40 PM - +263 71 889 4423: This is something, great!
8/2/24, 3:40 PM - +263 71 889 4423: Inspiring
8/2/24, 4:06 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: I see you are quite a visionary and we will work together to make the right decision for your career. It is important to know why the Edoofa guidance will be unique compared to the normal University approach.
8/2/24, 4:06 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: *1. Personalized mentorship and guidance throughout your course:* As your Career Counsellor, I have known you since the beginning of the process, understanding your interests, aspirations, family background and plans for your career, unlike a University officer who may come across your application for the first time and treats with the same importance like others. I personally understand where you come from and what is required for you to be successful.
8/2/24, 4:06 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: *2. The Earn While You Learn Program:*  Even though the EWYL program was affected by lessons and exams in Zimbabwe, you will have access to a streamlined process here in India with better earning projects, regular visits by mentors, seminars and training programs which even opens self-financing opportunities. Students have even catered their entire costs through their EWYL earnings.
8/2/24, 4:06 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: *3. Financial Support and Planning:* With a flexible payment plan for registration fees spreading across 45 days, the remaining cost of education can be paid in two installments. Students are ensured to open Indian bank accounts so that parents can even deposit the fees in monthly installments.
8/2/24, 4:07 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: *4. Industrial Visits, Attachments and practical learning experiences:* With the recent example of SLICE-CON which stands for Symposium of Leaders, Innovators and Creators with Edoofa Conclave 24 where our Edoofians embarked on an enlightening industrial visit, immersing themselves in dynamic interactions with our esteemed Founder, CEOs of different Companies which are recognized worldwide, and visionary entrepreneurs from the industry. We are also visiting Zimbabwe in February to prepare our Edoofians for their journey and help them with the next level of career.


*5. Department of Student Welfare:* With a dedicated department to look after the Welfare of our Edoofians, our DSW officers operate directly from our university desks, being approachable to Edoofians for any assistance and motivating them to be on track with their careers.


These are just a few of the various benefits and keeping all this in mind, are you ready to step into your higher education through the Edoofa Program which is the most popular scholarship in Africa?
