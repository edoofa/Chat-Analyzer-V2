I trust this message finds you well, and I hope you are in high spirits. In recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their A-Level results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey.
16/1/24, 12:05 PM - Ashi Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?

Quality Education
Conducive Environment
Critical Thinking and Practical learning skills

Career guidance, Mentorships, etc.

Personalized mentorship and guidance throughout your course:* As your Career Counsellor, I have known you since the beginning of the process, understanding your interests, aspirations, family background and plans for your career, unlike a University officer who may come across your application for the first time and treats with the same importance like others. I personally understand where you come from and what is required for you to be successful.
29/1/24, 1:12 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: *2. The Earn While You Learn Program:*  Even though the EWYL program was affected by lessons and exams in Zimbabwe, you will have access to a streamlined process here in India with better earning projects, regular visits by mentors, seminars and training programs which even opens self-financing opportunities. Students have even catered their entire costs through their EWYL earnings. <This message was edited>

2/2/24, 10:53 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Perfect, To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is BA (Economics) and your intake is in August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information is accurate?

2/2/24, 11:07 AM - +263 77 673 7538: Is it BA or Bsc??
2/2/24, 11:42 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Please it's BA
2/2/24, 12:18 PM - +263 77 673 7538: Can it be changed?
2/2/24, 1:11 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Brandon Can you further elaborate on your querry?
2/2/24, 2:14 PM - +263 77 673 7538: Isn't BA is bachelor of arts? And Bsc is bachelor of science am I right?
2/2/24, 2:16 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Yes please you are correct
2/2/24, 2:19 PM - +263 77 673 7538: Can you please explain to me the difference between the two
2/2/24, 2:43 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: The Difference Between Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Science. While a BA (Bachelor of Arts) degree usually focuses on general studies, along with subjects like the arts, communication and sociology, a BS (Bachelor of Science) degree delves into topics such as technology and healthcare.
2/2/24, 2:48 PM - +263 77 673 7538: Okay
2/2/24, 2:48 PM - +263 77 673 7538: ✅✅
2/2/24, 2:52 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: As I have promised, the Edoofa Admissions team will be submitting your application to multiple universities that will evaluate your application and upon being eligible, you receive the offer letters with comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. *I will guide you to the best education institution/university associated with us that aligns with your vision and interest and would provide you with a conducive environment for your holistic development and to fulfil your career goals.*

Upon receiving the Offer Letter, you will have a few weeks to pay a portion of your university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. We discussed the registration fee during our counselling sessions. May I know, what do you recall about the same now?
2/2/24, 2:54 PM - +263 77 673 7538: Yes I remember
2/2/24, 2:58 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Let me help you with a better understanding. *Usually, the registration fee is an additional fee apart from the cost of education but Edoofians receive an exclusive benefit where it is a part of the cost of education itself.* Let me give you an example:-
2/2/24, 2:59 PM - +263 77 673 7538: Okay
2/2/24, 3:05 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: As we discussed in the counselling session, the cost of education in India ranges from $6000-$8000 per annum which is reduced to $2000-$3000 per annum through the Edoofa Scholarship Program which includes the registration fee, remaining tuition fees, Accommodation, Food, Wifi, Laundry, library fee etc. Now, let us assume,

1. *Tuition Fee*: $1800 per annum
2. *Food and Accommodation Fee*: $1000 per annum 
Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum
3. *Registration Fee to be paid:* $1000 

This means this registration fee that you pay will be subtracted from the cost of education ($2800-$1000= $1800) and the remaining fee of $1800 can be paid in two installments. The first part of $900 within 3 days after your arrival here in India and the remaining $900 will be due in December 2024, or before your second semester begins.

*Do you have any questions for me regarding the same?*
2/2/24, 3:16 PM - +263 77 673 7538: Food and accomodation is optional right??
2/2/24, 3:16 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Can you elaborate?
2/2/24, 3:16 PM - +263 77 673 7538: I can live outside campus
2/2/24, 3:38 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Yes please you can Brandon
2/2/24, 3:39 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: The registration fee can be paid either in two equal parts(The first half within 15 days and the second half within 30 days) or in one go itself.

Are you clear with the details?
2/2/24, 3:39 PM - +263 77 673 7538: Okay
2/2/24, 3:39 PM - +263 77 673 7538: Crystal clear
2/2/24, 3:48 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: So to get your University letter prepared, 

I want you to share the following documents with us as they are required for university application preparation:

*1. A-Level Result/Letter of Recommendation/Statement of Entry (A-Level).*

*2. O-Level Results*

3/2/24, 8:18 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Good morning! let's draw inspiration from the timeless wisdom found in the Bible:
