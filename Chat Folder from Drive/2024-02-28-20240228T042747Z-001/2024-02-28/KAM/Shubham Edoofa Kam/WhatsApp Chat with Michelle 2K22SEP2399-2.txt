I will be guiding you toward realising your dream education with Edoofa. I am confident that together, we can ensure a promising start to your educational journey, leading to the right employment opportunities and ultimately, success for you and your family.
11/1/24, 1:02 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: In the past few days, I had an in-depth discussion with Mr. Shivjeet and had the opportunity to review your scholarship application file in our records. Through this process, I gained valuable insights into your dreams and aspirations to advance your academic career. Upon reviewing your application file, I was both impressed and reassured to assist you in achieving these goals here in India, which will unlock doors to incredible opportunities in the future.
11/1/24, 1:02 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Before we get into the specifics of your admission journey and talk about your admission process, I would like to share an exciting milestone that India as a country achieved within the first week of 2024 – the successful *India's Chandrayaan-3 Engine Test.* This accomplishment is responsible for the third lunar mission, aiming to land a rover on the Moon's south polar region and conduct scientific studies that could check Moon's viability to sustain life. It signifies a significant scientific advancement, laying the groundwork for future progress.
11/1/24, 1:02 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This achievement has not only pushed boundaries but also has inspired young minds all over the world to pursue their dreams. On the same note, I wanted to extend my heartiest wishes for the New Year to you and your family and check in to see how you and your family started your year?
16/1/24, 3:00 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Michelle,

I trust this message finds you well, and I hope you are in high spirits. In recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their A-Level results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey.
16/1/24, 3:17 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?

17/1/24, 12:48 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Kindly allow me time till Monday to thoroughly evaluate your results and plan the way forward.

2/2/24, 10:03 AM - +263 77 758 1943: Ok
2/2/24, 10:35 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Being a senior academician and counsellor, my aspirations for young learners like you are similar. I firmly believe higher education should combine the following for a learner to achieve their goals:-

Quality Education
Conducive Environment
Critical Thinking and Practical learning skills
Technological Literacy and Attachments
Cultural Awareness and Global Perspective
Career guidance, Mentorships, etc.

*However, not everyone achieves success. Do you know why*?
2/2/24, 10:43 AM - +263 77 758 1943: Ofcourse 
I think there are a lot of reasons behind that and these maybe that parents or the student fails to afford for higher education  and maybe the student is not committed to the extent that her focus and goals change and maybe starts focusing on irrelevant staff and sometimes there would be a crisis at home that make parents change their mindset in regard to education as they feel that its better to sideline the issue of higher education for the child and instead solve the crisis at home etc
2/2/24, 11:35 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
2/2/24, 11:38 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: It is important to know why the Edoofa guidance will be unique compared to the normal University approach.
2/2/24, 11:38 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: *1. Personalized mentorship and guidance throughout your course:* As your Career Counsellor, I have known you since the beginning of the process, understanding your interests, aspirations, family background and plans for your career, unlike a University officer who may come across your application for the first time and treats with the same importance like others. I personally understand where you come from and what is required for you to be successful.
2/2/24, 11:38 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: *2. The Earn While You Learn Program:*  Even though the EWYL program was affected by lessons and exams in Zimbabwe, you will have access to a streamlined process here in India with better earning projects, regular visits by mentors, seminars and training programs which even opens self-financing opportunities. Students have even catered their entire costs through their EWYL earnings.
2/2/24, 11:38 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
2/2/24, 11:38 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: *3. Financial Support and Planning:* With a flexible payment plan for registration fees spreading across 45 days, the remaining cost of education can be paid in two installments. Students are ensured to open Indian bank accounts so that parents can even deposit the fees in monthly installments.
2/2/24, 11:38 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
2/2/24, 11:39 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
2/2/24, 11:39 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: These are just a few of the various benefits and keeping all this in mind, are you ready to step into your higher education through the Edoofa Program which is the most popular scholarship in Africa?
2/2/24, 11:41 AM - +263 77 758 1943: Following
2/2/24, 11:41 AM - +263 77 758 1943: I am ready...
2/2/24, 12:59 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Perfect, To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is Bachelor of Arts - Bachelor of Legislative Lawand your intake is in August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information is accurate?
2/2/24, 1:22 PM - +263 77 231 6549: Very accurate
2/2/24, 1:26 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: As I have promised, the Edoofa Admissions team will be submitting your application to multiple universities that will evaluate your application and upon being eligible, you receive the offer letters with comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. *I will guide you to the best education institution/university associated with us that aligns with your vision and interest and would provide you with a conducive environment for your holistic development and to fulfil your career goals.*

Upon receiving the Offer Letter, you will have a few weeks to pay a portion of your university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. We discussed the registration fee during our counselling sessions. May I know, what do you recall about the same now?
2/2/24, 1:28 PM - +263 77 231 6549: That portion Fee  l remember it but not in detail
2/2/24, 1:34 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Let me help you with a better understanding. *Usually, the registration fee is an additional fee apart from the cost of education but Edoofians receive an exclusive benefit where it is a part of the cost of education itself.* Let me give you an example:-
2/2/24, 1:34 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: As we discussed in the counseling session, the cost of education in India ranges from $6000-$8000 per annum which is reduced to $1200-$1800 per annum through the Edoofa Scholarship Program *as we recommended your application for a higher quantum of scholarship.* Congratulations on the same. Now, let us assume,
2/2/24, 1:35 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: 1. *Tuition Fee*: $650 per annum
2. *Accommodation Fee*: $0 per annum (100% Sponsorship)
3. *Remaining Fee Components*: [Library Fee, Examination Fee, EDB and Book Bank, International Student Development Fund, 24-Hour WiFi Cost, Maintenance Fee, Water Bill, and Electricity Bill]: $1000 per annum

*Total Fee: Tuition Fee $650 + Accommodation Fee $0 + Remaining Fee Components $1000 = $1650 per annum.*
4. *Registration Fee to be paid:* $1000
2/2/24, 1:35 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: This means this registration fee will be waived off from the cost of education ($1650-$1000= $650) and this remaining fee of $650 is supposed to be paid within 3 days of arrival.

*Do you have any questions for me regarding the same?*
2/2/24, 1:36 PM - +263 77 231 6549: Understood
2/2/24, 1:52 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: The registration fee can be paid either in two equal parts(The first half within 15 days and the second half within 30 days) or in one go itself.

Are you clear with the details?
2/2/24, 2:08 PM - +263 77 231 6549: Yes
2/2/24, 2:12 PM - +263 77 231 6549: Following
2/2/24, 2:13 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: So to get your University letter prepared,

*Proverbs 1:5:*

*"Let the wise listen and add to their learning.' In the tapestry of progress, education is the thread that weaves nations together. As India seeks wisdom, let us prioritize education, creating a future where knowledge transcends boundaries and resonates more profoundly than ever. A commitment to learning is a commitment to a thriving, united nation."*
