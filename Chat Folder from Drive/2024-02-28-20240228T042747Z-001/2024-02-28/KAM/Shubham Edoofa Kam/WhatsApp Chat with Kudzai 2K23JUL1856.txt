16/1/24, 11:26 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Kudzai,

I trust this message finds you well, and I hope you are in high spirits. In recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their A-Level results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey.
16/1/24, 11:26 AM - Kirti Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?
16/1/24, 4:34 PM - +27 74 685 8686: I already shared the results with you
17/1/24, 12:09 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, I hope you are doing well. 

It is alright, please. Kindly allow us time till Monday to thoroughly evaluate your results and plan the way forward. Once we have re-evaluated your application, along with all the other applications, Mr. Shubham, the senior career counselor at Edoofa will connect with you to guide you on the next steps in your academic career.
17/1/24, 12:11 PM - +27 74 685 8686: Alright I even paid the agent fee of $350 last year
17/1/24, 12:12 PM - +27 74 685 8686: I’m only waiting for you to get me an admission at a university as you had promised before 
And if you fail I would kindly ask you to refund me the $350 I paid
17/1/24, 12:13 PM - +27 74 685 8686: Because since last year I’ve been waiting
17/1/24, 12:16 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing that with me, however, I believe you have already received an offer letter and we did not have a smooth conversation with you after 15th November because you had your reasons and I understand those completely. And now Mr. Shubham will be connecting with you on Monday to assist you further.
17/1/24, 12:18 PM - +27 74 685 8686: Alright I will be waiting
22/1/24, 9:44 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Good Day, Kudzai

22/1/24, 11:22 AM - +27 74 685 8686: Alright the major issue was that I couldn’t reach my parents to share with them the news on time
22/1/24, 11:23 AM - +27 74 685 8686: When I reached them it already was late and they said that the costs of the university are high they can’t afford it
22/1/24, 11:25 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Duly noted, So Since your results were out in 2022, What have you been up to since then, Did you manage to enroll your self in an university?

*“Education is the key to unlocking the world. It is the passport to freedom.” ---- Oprah Winfrey*

With all positive energy, I am here to continue our interactive session.
29/1/24, 8:38 AM - +27 74 685 8686: Good morning how are you
29/1/24, 9:51 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: I am doing great please

29/1/24, 10:16 AM - +27 74 685 8686: Let’s proceed
29/1/24, 10:59 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Being a senior academician and counsellor, my aspirations for young learners like you are similar. I firmly believe higher education should combine the following for a learner to achieve their goals:-

Quality Education
Conducive Environment
Critical Thinking and Practical learning skills
Technological Literacy and Attachments
Cultural Awareness and Global Perspective
Career guidance, Mentorships, etc.

*However, not everyone achieves success. Do you know why*?
29/1/24, 11:44 AM - +27 74 685 8686: Why
29/1/24, 11:59 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
29/1/24, 12:04 PM - +27 74 685 8686: Okay
29/1/24, 12:12 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: I see you are quite a visionary and we will work together to make the right decision for your career. It is important to know why the Edoofa guidance will be unique compared to the normal University approach.
29/1/24, 12:12 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: *1. Personalized mentorship and guidance throughout your course:* As your Career Counsellor, I have known you since the beginning of the process, understanding your interests, aspirations, family background and plans for your career, unlike a University officer who may come across your application for the first time and treats with the same importance like others. I personally understand where you come from and what is required for you to be successful.
29/1/24, 12:12 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
29/1/24, 12:12 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: *3. Financial Support and Planning:* With a flexible payment plan for registration fees spreading across 45 days, the remaining cost of education can be paid in two installments. Students are ensured to open Indian bank accounts so that parents can even deposit the fees in monthly installments.

29/1/24, 12:13 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
29/1/24, 12:13 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: These are just a few of the various benefits and keeping all this in mind, are you ready to step into your higher education through the Edoofa Program which is the most popular scholarship in Africa?
29/1/24, 12:14 PM - +27 74 685 8686: I’m not sure
29/1/24, 12:16 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: can you help me understand the issue yoou are facing?
29/1/24, 12:17 PM - +27 74 685 8686: I remember explaining this to you Sir
Even my parents explained why I can’t continue with this progam
29/1/24, 12:18 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Surely, I remember, And I will assist you with the same
29/1/24, 12:28 PM - +27 74 685 8686: Okae
29/1/24, 12:30 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Kudzai Let me help you understand the Situation in Zimbabwe in much more detail

While the cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, the cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal which is Sadza and curry costs a student $1 one time and you are aware of this better. The cost of *Accommodation, Food, Wifi, stationery, gadgets, transport* etc is an additional expense for a student. The initial registration fee for the Zimbabwean Universities ranges from *$20-$75 without the guarantee of being eligible or not.* The *attachment fee before graduation ranges from $200 or more.*
29/1/24, 12:30 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Let me tell you, I was caught in surprise when I compared it with the Edoofa Scholarship Program, not because of affordability but the opportunity to acquire skills, knowledge and be employable. Speaking about Employability, do you feel Zimbabwe is ready to equip the graduates with job opportunities in their aspired fields?
29/1/24, 12:31 PM - +27 74 685 8686: I’m aware
29/1/24, 12:33 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: This message was deleted
29/1/24, 12:37 PM - +27 74 685 8686: Ok
29/1/24, 1:07 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Perfect, To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is BA (Sociology) and your intake is in August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information is accurate?
29/1/24, 1:35 PM - +27 74 685 8686: Yes it’s accurate
29/1/24, 1:44 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: As I have promised, the Edoofa Admissions team will be submitting your application to multiple universities that will evaluate your application and upon being eligible, you receive the offer letters with comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. *I will guide you to the best education institution/university associated with us that aligns with your vision and interest and would provide you with a conducive environment for your holistic development and to fulfil your career goals.*
29/1/24, 1:44 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Upon receiving the Offer Letter, you will have a few weeks to pay a portion of your university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. We discussed the registration fee during our counselling sessions. May I know, what do you recall about the same now?
29/1/24, 3:02 PM - +27 74 685 8686: Yeah I do
29/1/24, 3:43 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Let me help you with a better understanding. *Usually, the registration fee is an additional fee apart from the cost of education but Edoofians receive an exclusive benefit where it is a part of the cost of education itself.* Let me give you an example:-
29/1/24, 3:44 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: As we discussed in the counselling session, the cost of education in India ranges from $6000-$8000 per annum which is reduced to $2000-$3000 per annum through the Edoofa Scholarship Program which includes the registration fee, remaining tuition fees, Accommodation, Food, Wifi, Laundry, library fee etc. Now, let us assume,

1. *Tuition Fee*: $1800 per annum
2. *Food and Accommodation Fee*: $1000 per annum 
Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum
3. *Registration Fee to be paid:* $1000
29/1/24, 3:44 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: This means this registration fee that you pay will be subtracted from the cost of education ($2800-$1000= $1800) and the remaining fee of $1800 can be paid in two installments. The first part of $900 within 3 days after your arrival here in India and the remaining $900 will be due in December 2024, or before your second semester begins.

*Do you have any questions for me regarding the same?*
29/1/24, 3:51 PM - +27 74 685 8686: No
29/1/24, 3:51 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: The registration fee can be paid either in two equal parts(The first half within 15 days and the second half within 30 days) or in one go itself.

Are you clear with the details?
29/1/24, 3:53 PM - +27 74 685 8686: Yes
29/1/24, 3:55 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Duly noted please
29/1/24, 3:55 PM - +27 74 685 8686: I understand and you’ve said all this before
29/1/24, 3:56 PM - +27 74 685 8686: As far as I’m concerned right now and with the situation we already explained to you we can’t afford any of this now .Things changed
29/1/24, 3:57 PM - +27 74 685 8686: The $1000 registration fee you’re talking about we won’t be able to pay it
29/1/24, 4:06 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Please to financially assist you with this issue the program director would like to connect with you over a video call session
29/1/24, 4:10 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: *So your Video call session is scheduled for 09:30 AM CAT*
29/1/24, 4:10 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Please be available on your scheduled time for Kudzai's application to proceed ahead
29/1/24, 4:12 PM - +27 74 685 8686: Alright
30/1/24, 8:33 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Good morning!  let's draw inspiration from the timeless wisdom found in the Bible:

*"As the scriptures teach, knowledge is a steadfast companion. A person enlightened by wisdom is held in high regard across all realms. The brilliance of education surpasses the allure of beauty and the vigor of youth."*
