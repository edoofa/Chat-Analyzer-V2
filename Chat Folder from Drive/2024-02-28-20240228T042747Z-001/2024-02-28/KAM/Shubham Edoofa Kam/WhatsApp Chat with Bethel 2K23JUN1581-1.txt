29/1/24, 2:05 PM - +263 77 384 2368: Justa quick question. 

How much is the fees per semester excluding the scholarship?? That is how much do we pay as parents? 

Thank you!
29/1/24, 2:06 PM - +263 77 642 5043: The information is accurate
29/1/24, 2:22 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Please without the scholarship the annual fees would be around $4000-$5000
29/1/24, 2:22 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: As I have promised, the Edoofa Admissions team will be submitting your application to multiple universities that will evaluate your application and upon being eligible, you receive the offer letters with comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. *I will guide you to the best education institution/university associated with us that aligns with your vision and interest and would provide you with a conducive environment for your holistic development and to fulfil your career goals.*
29/1/24, 2:22 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Upon receiving the Offer Letter, you will have a few weeks to pay a portion of your university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. We discussed the registration fee during our counselling sessions. May I know, what do you recall about the same now?
29/1/24, 3:19 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Are we connected?
29/1/24, 3:19 PM - +263 77 642 5043: Yes we are
29/1/24, 3:19 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: So please answer
29/1/24, 3:24 PM - +263 77 384 2368: Sorry, I am currently in a meeting. You can go ahead with the session.
29/1/24, 3:24 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Let me help you with a better understanding. *Usually, the registration fee is an additional fee apart from the cost of education but Edoofians receive an exclusive benefit where it is a part of the cost of education itself.* Let me give you an example:-
29/1/24, 3:24 PM - +263 77 642 5043: Okay
29/1/24, 3:25 PM - +263 77 642 5043: Go ahead
29/1/24, 3:27 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: As we discussed in the counselling session, the cost of education in India ranges from $6000-$8000 per annum which is reduced to $2000-$3000 per annum through the Edoofa Scholarship Program which includes the registration fee, remaining tuition fees, Accommodation, Food, Wifi, Laundry, library fee etc. Now, let us assume,

1. *Tuition Fee*: $1800 per annum
2. *Food and Accommodation Fee*: $1000 per annum 
Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum
3. *Registration Fee to be paid:* $1000
29/1/24, 3:27 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: This means this registration fee that you pay will be subtracted from the cost of education ($2800-$1000= $1800) and the remaining fee of $1800 can be paid in two installments. The first part of $900 within 3 days after your arrival here in India and the remaining $900 will be due in December 2024, or before your second semester begins.

*Do you have any questions for me regarding the same?*
29/1/24, 4:50 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: I have noted all your responses for the day, Since my working hours for the day are over now, *I have therefore scheduled your session for 09:30 AM CAT tomorrow*

God Bless you,
Have a great day ahead!

30/1/24, 8:33 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Good morning!  let's draw inspiration from the timeless wisdom found in the Bible:

*"As the scriptures teach, knowledge is a steadfast companion. A person enlightened by wisdom is held in high regard across all realms. The brilliance of education surpasses the allure of beauty and the vigor of youth."*

So yesterday after meeting with Vilsha, the Head of Admissions, Bethel decided to undertake the Diploma in Computer Engineering at Galgotias University with a registration fee of $750.00

We had paid an initial deposit of $500.00 giving us a balance of $250.00

Now Vilsha gave us a discount of $100.00 on condition that we pay by the 20st of February which is tomorrow. 

This means the amount due was $150.00 which we paid as $155.00 and the $10.00 is the rate given by Mr Rajan.
