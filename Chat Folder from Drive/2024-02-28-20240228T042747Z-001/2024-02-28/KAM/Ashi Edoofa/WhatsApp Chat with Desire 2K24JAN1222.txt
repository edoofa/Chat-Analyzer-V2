26/1/24, 1:27 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
26/1/24, 1:27 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.
26/1/24, 1:27 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I hope you are following?
26/1/24, 1:40 PM - +263 78 126 3228: Yes i am following
26/1/24, 1:43 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps-
26/1/24, 1:43 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of *$500 to $1000.* Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
26/1/24, 1:43 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.
26/1/24, 1:43 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I hope these are clear as well?
26/1/24, 1:47 PM - +263 78 126 3228: Noted
26/1/24, 1:50 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for the further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
26/1/24, 1:57 PM - +263 78 126 3228: Yes let’s proceed
26/1/24, 1:58 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
26/1/24, 1:58 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually. 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention.

26/1/24, 3:18 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your insights with us dear, Let me also add to each video that you watched and help you summarize a few additional insights:
26/1/24, 3:18 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 1: Important Message for Enrolled Students*

The first video underscores the importance of two crucial qualities: open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions. Edoofa's vision for its students is to foster success in their careers, and promote responsibility, and independence. A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.
26/1/24, 3:18 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s Vision for You*

Edoofa's vision for its students is to provide them with employment opportunities and the skills necessary to become future leaders. The program places students above other candidates by investing significant time and effort into finding reputable, education-focused institutions rather than solely business-oriented ones.
26/1/24, 3:18 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

In the third video, it is highlighted that Edoofa's founders have dedicated over a decade to meticulously identify reputable educational institutions. Students are advised to cultivate the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to excel in the job market. All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to student's career goals.
26/1/24, 3:18 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools. It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.
26/1/24, 3:18 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In summary, these videos emphasize the significance of qualities such as open-mindedness, following instructions, and cooperation. Edoofa's vision is to empower students for successful careers and leadership roles by carefully selecting educational institutions. The SOP is a vital tool for effective communication and admission success. 

I hope you agree with all of this and were able to understand these by watching the four videos?

Each layer performs specific tasks and communicates with adjacent layers to facilitate data exchange between systems. The layers, from the bottom to the top, are:

1.Physical Layer:Deals with the physical connection between devices, addressing aspects such as cables, connectors, and hardware signaling.

2. Data Link Layer:Manages data framing, error detection, and flow control within the network. It ensures reliable point-to-point or point-to-multipoint communication.

3. Network Layer:Handles logical addressing, routing, and packet forwarding. This layer enables devices on different networks to communicate by determining the best path for data transmission.

4. Transport Layer:Ensures reliable end-to-end communication. It handles segmentation and reassembly of data, error detection, and flow control.

5. Session Layer:Manages sessions or connections between applications, providing synchronization and dialog control. It establishes, maintains, and terminates communication sessions.

6. Presentation Layer:Deals with data translation, encryption, and compression. It ensures that data is presented in a readable format for the application layer.

7. Application Layer:Provides network services directly to end-users or applications. It includes network-aware applications and protocols, facilitating communication between software and the network.

The OSI model helps in understanding and designing network architectures by breaking down complex processes into modular and manageable components.

27/1/24, 1:05 PM - +263 78 126 3228: (2). Primary Memory (RAM - Random Access Memory):
Primary memory is volatile and used for temporary storage. It's directly accessible by the CPU for quick data retrieval during program execution. RAM is a common type of primary memory. For example, when you open applications on your computer, the data is temporarily stored in RAM for quick access. However, it loses its content when the power is turned off.

Where as

-Secondary Memory (Hard Drive, SSD - Solid State Drive):
Secondary memory is non-volatile and used for long-term storage of data. Unlike primary memory, it retains data even when the power is off. Examples include hard drives and solid-state drives. For instance, your computer's operating system, applications, and files are stored in the secondary memory. Even after shutting down the system, the data remains intact for future use.

(4). Operator overloading is the basic feature of certain languages that allow to have polymorphic expressions, so that c = a+b can work also with types other than plain numbers, like arithmetic vectors (like the 3D vector of a geometric space), string (where it is often used to provide concatenation) or template ...


(5). Absolutely, technology plays a pivotal role in fostering economic growth for a country. Here are some ways in which technology contributes to economic development:

1.Increased Productivity:Technological advancements enhance efficiency and productivity across various industries, leading to increased output without a proportional increase in resources.

2. Innovation and Competitiveness:Technology stimulates innovation, encouraging businesses to develop new products, services, and processes. This fosters competitiveness in the global market.

3. Job Creation:The technology sector itself creates job opportunities, and the integration of technology in other sectors often leads to new roles and specializations, contributing to overall employment.

4. Access to Global Markets:Technology facilitates international trade and e-commerce, enabling businesses to reach global markets, expand their customer base, and participate in global supply chains.

5. Improved Infrastructure:Technology contributes to the development of critical infrastructure, such as smart cities, efficient transportation systems, and energy grids, which further supports economic growth.

6. Financial Inclusion:Digital technologies, including mobile banking and online payment systems, enhance financial inclusion by providing access to banking services for a broader population.

7. Entrepreneurship and Small Businesses:Technology lowers barriers to entry for entrepreneurs and small businesses, allowing them to compete more effectively and contribute to economic diversification.

8. Data-Driven Decision-Making:Technology enables better data collection, analysis, and decision-making, helping businesses and governments make informed choices that can positively impact the economy.

9. Human Capital Development:Investments in technology education and training programs contribute to the development of a skilled workforce, fostering innovation and supporting economic growth.

10. Sustainable Practices:Technology can promote environmentally sustainable practices, such as renewable energy solutions and efficient resource management, aligning economic growth with environmental responsibility.

While technology is a powerful driver of economic growth, it's essential to ensure inclusive access and address potential challenges, such as job displacement and the digital divide, to maximize the benefits for all segments of society.

27/1/24, 1:07 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for providing the academic questions. With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey. we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*.
27/1/24, 1:08 PM - +263 78 126 3228: Yes maam let's proceed
27/1/24, 1:08 PM - Ashi Edoofa: However, before we do the same, I was going through your scholarship application file and noticed that you are supposed to make the payment of your remaining part of Edoofa Enrollment fee before 18th February, 2024. Hence, I thought of sharing a gentle reminder with you and try to understand how your preparation has been so far? Have you been able to align your preparations in the right direction?
27/1/24, 1:09 PM - +263 78 126 3228: I payed all the enrollment fee you can the proof of payment
27/1/24, 1:10 PM - +263 78 126 3228: <Media omitted>
27/1/24, 1:10 PM - +263 78 126 3228: <Media omitted>
27/1/24, 1:10 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know dear. let us move forward with our discussion. To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is *Diploma (Computer Science Engineering)* and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
27/1/24, 1:11 PM - +263 78 126 3228: Yes ma'am that's it
27/1/24, 1:11 PM - +263 78 126 3228: So i don't have any remaining fee right??
27/1/24, 1:12 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Correct dear
27/1/24, 1:12 PM - +263 78 126 3228: Good to know
27/1/24, 1:12 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
27/1/24, 1:12 PM - +263 78 126 3228: We can proceed
27/1/24, 1:12 PM - Ashi Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
27/1/24, 1:12 PM - Ashi Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
27/1/24, 1:12 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
27/1/24, 1:12 PM - +263 78 126 3228: Noted
27/1/24, 1:13 PM - +263 78 126 3228: Yes i know
27/1/24, 1:14 PM - +263 78 126 3228: But then is there any chance of not getting a scholarship from these universities??
27/1/24, 1:16 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Dear, Let me correct you here that the scholarship opportunity truly depends on your academic performance and SOP. I believe you will indeed get the scholarship opportunity
27/1/24, 1:16 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
27/1/24, 1:16 PM - Ashi Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $1000. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
27/1/24, 1:17 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
27/1/24, 1:18 PM - +263 78 126 3228: Correct
27/1/24, 1:19 PM - +263 78 126 3228: We can proceed
27/1/24, 1:21 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
27/1/24, 1:23 PM - +263 78 126 3228: Yes we are
27/1/24, 1:25 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

1. *Tuition Fee*: $1800 per annum
2. *Food and Accommodation Fee*: $1000 per annum 

*Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum*
27/1/24, 1:25 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Registration Fee to be paid: $1000 (deadline within two weeks of issue of the offer letter, part of the university’s first-year fee and will be adjusted against the first-year cost of education $2800). I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?
27/1/24, 1:28 PM - +263 78 126 3228: Noted
27/1/24, 1:29 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $1000, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $1000 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
27/1/24, 1:29 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $1000 = $1800. This amount can be paid in two installments of $900 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $900 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
27/1/24, 1:52 PM - +263 78 126 3228: Noted
27/1/24, 1:53 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
27/1/24, 1:53 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
27/1/24, 1:53 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden.

27/1/24, 1:54 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
27/1/24, 2:00 PM - +263 78 126 3228: No queries
27/1/24, 2:00 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright please, Now with this, we are done with step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
27/1/24, 2:00 PM - Ashi Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one.
27/1/24, 2:00 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
27/1/24, 2:00 PM - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
27/1/24, 2:01 PM - +263 78 126 3228: Sure
27/1/24, 2:02 PM - +263 78 126 3228: Wow that's very good
27/1/24, 2:02 PM - +263 78 126 3228: Noted
27/1/24, 2:02 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Yes, indeed dear. The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
27/1/24, 2:02 PM - Ashi Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received special news for the students of the 2024 admission intake. May I know if you are excited to know the news we have for you?
27/1/24, 2:04 PM - +263 78 126 3228: Yes you can share with me
27/1/24, 2:05 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am happy to see that you are excited. After speaking with thousands of students and parents who completed their admission process before you, we realized that the current economic situation in African countries makes it a bit challenging for parents to pay the full registration fee at once. 

In response to the same challenge, we had a detailed discussion with the academic board and university official. As a result, we developed a solution to alleviate the financial burden of the parents specifically for the registration fee due of $500 to $1000.
27/1/24, 2:05 PM - Ashi Edoofa: We at Edoofa are thrilled about this development, and I believe it will significantly help all of our students and their families. Are you aware of the solution?
27/1/24, 2:08 PM - +263 78 126 3228: Noo you can tell me the solution
27/1/24, 2:09 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That is alright, let me share the same. With respect to the conversation we had with the academic board and the university officials, we requested them to allow the students to make the payment of their registration fee in two parts within a span of 45 days thereby reducing the financial pressure.
27/1/24, 2:09 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Here's how it works: Consider that your registration fee is $1000. After you will receive the offer letter, the first part of the registration fees which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, i.e. $500 needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university (For most of the universities 15 days). Subsequently, the second part of $500, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
27/1/24, 2:09 PM - +263 78 126 3228: Am just assuming that the registration fee cost is reduced
27/1/24, 2:09 PM - Ashi Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for January 29 , 2024, and your registration fee stands at $1000, you'll need to make a payment of $500 on or before January 29, 2024. The remaining $500 should be paid by February 29 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
27/1/24, 2:11 PM - +263 78 126 3228: Well noted
27/1/24, 2:13 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
27/1/24, 2:16 PM - +263 78 126 3228: I don't have question
27/1/24, 2:16 PM - +263 78 126 3228: Or query
27/1/24, 2:17 PM - Ashi Edoofa: So, are you excited to initiate the process? For the current round of admissions, only 31 scholarship seats are available and hence let us begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the payment plan offered for the registration fee. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
27/1/24, 2:19 PM - +263 78 126 3228: Yes i am interested
27/1/24, 2:22 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation and with your approval, we will now proceed with the preparations for the application and submit it to the universities recommended by the academic board, tailored to your chosen course. 

Once we receive updates from the universities, we will quickly reconnect with you and share all the relevant information.

21/2/24, 9:18 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know dear that you have shared your concern with the team, Let me help you understand that why you have been asked to pay the amount for your registration this month, and I would like to help you understand why this is necessary.

The university officials have set a deadline for completing the registration process, and it is important to adhere to this timeline in order to avoid any complications or delays. I know that you mentioned that you will receive the amount in the first week of March, and I appreciate your efforts to save for your education.
21/2/24, 9:19 AM - Ashi Edoofa: However, I understand your concerns here as well. To make sure we help you here, I am sure you must have saved some amount for your registration process, right ?
21/2/24, 9:19 AM - +263 78 126 3228: So what is the way forward, whats your conclusion
21/2/24, 9:23 AM - Ashi Edoofa: @263781263228 To make sure we have a clear understanding here about your situation, I would like to know the amount you have been able to save for your admission, could you please let me know ?
21/2/24, 9:25 AM - +263 78 126 3228: $350 then the other half in the next 30 days
21/2/24, 9:30 AM - Ashi Edoofa: @263781263228 Have you been able to raise $350 ?
21/2/24, 9:38 AM - +263 78 126 3228: Yea that’s the money am getting next week
21/2/24, 9:39 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Could you please let me know the exact date ?
21/2/24, 9:40 AM - +263 78 126 3228: 7 March
21/2/24, 9:41 AM - Ashi Edoofa: @263781263228 I believe you are not able to understand my messages here. I want to clarify that I was asking the amount which you can pay before 29th of February please ?
21/2/24, 9:43 AM - +263 78 126 3228: Am saying i was supposed to pay half this month then the next half next month, but then am receiving the money that i was supposed to pay this month on the first week of March , is it clear now ?
21/2/24, 9:51 AM - Ashi Edoofa: That is completely clear dear. As you may know, the competition for these scholarship seats is worldwide, and the university officials need to be fair to every student.

I understand that you will have the desired amount in the first week of March, and I appreciate your commitment to this opportunity. However, to ensure that the university understands your commitment, I suggest making a minimum payment of $100 by February 29th.
