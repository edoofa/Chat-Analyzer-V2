29/12/23, 7:27 AM - Piiyush Edoofa added you
18/1/24, 12:00 PM - Vilsha Edoofa: Good Morning Mr. Gilbert, Mrs. Rhoda, and Tinotenda,

This is *Ms. Vilsha, I serve as the Head of Admissions* at Edoofa. Recently, I was reviewing the application files for students who enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program for the academic intake of August 2023 but were unable to join the universities at that time.
18/1/24, 12:01 PM - Vilsha Edoofa: During this process, I noticed that Tinotenda was one of the students who aspired to pursue a Diploma in Business Administration but faced challenges due to unsatisfactory O Level results, particularly in the subject of Mathematics.
18/1/24, 12:02 PM - Vilsha Edoofa: Given the passage of time since our last conversation, I wanted to personally reach out and inquire about how you and your family have been doing. How are things on your end?
18/1/24, 12:18 PM - +263 77 388 8768: Yes,we are praying that her O level results especially mathematics will be good this time around so that she pursue her studies
18/1/24, 12:40 PM - Vilsha Edoofa: Absolutely, Mr. Gilbert. We understand the importance of Tinotenda's O-level results, especially in Mathematics, for her pursuit of studies. We are confident that she will be able to clear her exams and will be well-prepared to focus on her studies. As always, our thoughts and best wishes are with her.
18/1/24, 12:41 PM - Vilsha Edoofa: I also noticed that Tinotenda is not a part of her admission group any longer. I believe she must have faced a technical challenge with her device because of which she left the group. Could you please check with her if she is in a position to rejoin and reconnect with us so that we can understand how her exams went and help her plan the way forward for her education?
18/1/24, 12:43 PM - +263 77 388 8768: Definitely will check with her why she exited the admission group
18/1/24, 12:53 PM - Vilsha Edoofa: Thank you for the update, Mr. Gilbert. I have requested Mr. Piyush @919958440855, your career counselor at Edoofa, to make you an admin of Tinotenda's admission group and I believe he has done the same.
18/1/24, 12:53 PM - Vilsha Edoofa: Once you check with Tinotenda, you can also add her back to the group so that we can reconnect with her as well. Once you do the same, please let me know! I am looking forward to connecting with you and your family.
18/1/24, 1:08 PM - +263 77 388 8768: Tino.vcf (file attached)
18/1/24, 1:54 PM - Vilsha Edoofa: Thank you for sharing Tinotenda's contact, Mr. Gilbert.
18/1/24, 1:54 PM - Vilsha Edoofa: Also, good afternoon, Tinotenda. I am *Ms. Vilsha, the Head of Admissions at Edoofa*. I recently had a conversation with your father, who mentioned that you have completed your exams and are expecting your O-level results this week. Therefore, I wanted to reach out to you and inquire how your exams went?
18/1/24, 2:02 PM - ~ JenaraGilbert added +263 77 408 4142
19/1/24, 8:15 AM - +263 77 408 4142: Good morning it's Tinotenda
23/1/24, 2:54 PM - Vilsha Edoofa: Good Afternoon Mr. Gilbert, Mrs. Rhoda and Providence,

I trust this message finds you well, and I hope you are in high spirits. In recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their A-Level results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey.
23/1/24, 2:55 PM - Vilsha Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your O-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your O-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?
23/1/24, 3:01 PM - +263 77 408 4142: Good afternoon
23/1/24, 3:02 PM - +263 77 408 4142: Well I'm actually having difficulties opening my results so I haven't opened them yet and promise to share them with you as soon as I'm able to open them
23/1/24, 3:05 PM - Vilsha Edoofa: Certainly, Tinotenda, that would be absolutely fine. You can share your results once you have reviewed them. We are looking forward to receiving your results and guiding you with the way forward for your admission journey. Let me know if and when you need any assistance.
23/1/24, 3:05 PM - +263 77 408 4142: Okay I will surely do so
26/1/24, 6:00 PM - +263 77 408 4142: <Media omitted>
30/1/24, 12:22 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Tinotenda, I hope you find this message in good health. 

Thank you for sharing your results with us. I noticed that your O-level results didn't turn out as we had hoped, particularly with the challenge in one subject. However, I want to take a moment to remind you that this result is not a reflection of your abilities or potential. It's simply a hurdle on your academic journey, one that you are more than capable of overcoming.
30/1/24, 12:22 PM - Ashi Edoofa: It's important to remember that everyone faces setbacks at some point. What matters most is how we respond to them. This is an opportunity for growth and learning. Reflect on the experience, identify areas for improvement, and use this as a stepping stone towards future successes.
30/1/24, 12:22 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Rest assured, that you have Edoofa’s full support in navigating this phase. Whether it's discussing options for retaking the exam, exploring alternative career paths, or just needing someone to guide you, we are here for you. 

I have taken note of your results and I will add them to your scholarship application. This will enable us to engage in discussions with the academic board and chart the best course of action for your next steps.
30/1/24, 12:24 PM - +263 77 408 4142: Good afternoon how are you doing
30/1/24, 12:25 PM - +263 77 408 4142: Okay thank you
30/1/24, 12:31 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am doing well thank you for asking. I would like to share my introduction with you, I am Ms. Ashi, Admission Officer at Edoofa, and I'm excited to guide you through the next steps of your admission journey.
30/1/24, 12:34 PM - +263 77 408 4142: Okay nice to know you ma'am
30/1/24, 12:35 PM - Ashi Edoofa: It's my pleasure! As you have received your results I would like to know what happened in your Mathematics exam due to which you have ungraded result ?
30/1/24, 12:42 PM - +263 77 408 4142: Well to be honest nothing happened ma'am I was just not good in  Maths
30/1/24, 12:45 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I understand dear, I would like to understand what are your plans ahead for your education ?
30/1/24, 12:47 PM - +263 77 408 4142: I was planning on going to A level
30/1/24, 12:52 PM - +263 77 408 4142: <Media omitted>
30/1/24, 12:53 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your plans to start your A levels. Recently, I have been reviewing your scholarship application and I wanted to confirm if you have enrolled for Diploma in Business Administration. Could you please let me know if this is correct?
30/1/24, 12:55 PM - +263 77 408 4142: Yes that's correct ma'am
30/1/24, 1:09 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Great, Now as you have mentioned that you want to go for A level, I would like to understand what are your thought process here for your further education ?
30/1/24, 1:12 PM - +263 77 408 4142: With these 6 subjects can I study for the Diploma in BA
30/1/24, 1:13 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am happy to share that you are indeed eligible for Diploma in Business Administration, and you can start your education journey from this year
30/1/24, 1:23 PM - +263 77 408 4142: That's great news ma'am so will I be doing the diploma online or I will be attending at an Indian college
30/1/24, 1:27 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Dear, You will be coming to India in order to pursue your diploma and we will be assisting you regarding the same
30/1/24, 1:40 PM - +263 77 408 4142: Okay so when can I start ma'am
30/1/24, 1:45 PM - +263 77 408 4142: When is the admission,how do you go about visa application process
30/1/24, 1:53 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Please don't worry, I will guide you with all the steps needed for your journey. To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is *Diploma in Business Administration* and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
30/1/24, 1:54 PM - +263 77 408 4142: Yes that's correct
30/1/24, 1:57 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for the confirmation, As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
30/1/24, 1:57 PM - Ashi Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
30/1/24, 1:58 PM - Ashi Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
30/1/24, 1:58 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
30/1/24, 2:00 PM - +263 77 408 4142: Yes that's correct
30/1/24, 2:01 PM - +263 77 408 4142: Okay noted
30/1/24, 2:01 PM - +263 77 408 4142: Okay
30/1/24, 2:08 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
30/1/24, 2:08 PM - Ashi Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $750. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
30/1/24, 2:08 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
30/1/24, 2:10 PM - +263 77 408 4142: Yes that's correct
30/1/24, 2:12 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
30/1/24, 2:17 PM - +263 77 408 4142: Yes ma'am
30/1/24, 2:19 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

1. *Tuition Fee*: $1800 per annum
2. *Food and Accommodation Fee*: $1000 per annum 

*Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum*
30/1/24, 2:19 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Registration Fee to be paid: $750 (deadline within two weeks of issue of the offer letter, part of the university’s first-year fee and will be adjusted against the first-year cost of education $2800). I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?
30/1/24, 2:20 PM - +263 77 408 4142: Yes noted
30/1/24, 2:21 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $750, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
30/1/24, 2:23 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $750= $2050. This amount can be paid in two installments of $1025 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $1025 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
30/1/24, 2:24 PM - +263 77 408 4142: Okay
30/1/24, 2:25 PM - +263 77 408 4142: Okay noted
30/1/24, 2:25 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
30/1/24, 2:26 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
30/1/24, 2:26 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
30/1/24, 2:28 PM - +263 77 408 4142: Okay
30/1/24, 2:29 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
30/1/24, 2:49 PM - +263 77 408 4142: Okay
No questions
30/1/24, 2:52 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright please, Now with this, we are done with step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
30/1/24, 2:52 PM - Ashi Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one.
30/1/24, 2:52 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
30/1/24, 2:52 PM - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
30/1/24, 2:53 PM - +263 77 408 4142: Okay
Yes we are
30/1/24, 2:57 PM - Ashi Edoofa: The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
30/1/24, 2:57 PM - Ashi Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received special news for the students of the 2024 admission intake. May I know if you are excited to know the news we have for you?
30/1/24, 3:18 PM - +263 77 408 4142: Yes I am
30/1/24, 3:18 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am happy to see that you are excited. After speaking with thousands of students and parents who completed their admission process before you, we realized that the current economic situation in African countries makes it a bit challenging for parents to pay the full registration fee at once. 

In response to the same challenge, we had a detailed discussion with the academic board and university official. As a result, we developed a solution to alleviate the financial burden of the parents specifically for the registration fee due of $500 to $750.
30/1/24, 3:18 PM - Ashi Edoofa: We at Edoofa are thrilled about this development, and I believe it will significantly help all of our students and their families. Are you aware of the solution?
30/1/24, 3:21 PM - +263 77 408 4142: No what is the solution
I'm thinking it might be the EWYL program
30/1/24, 3:24 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That is alright, let me share the same. With respect to the conversation we had with the academic board and the university officials, we requested them to allow the students to make the payment of their registration fee in two parts within a span of 45 days thereby reducing the financial pressure.
30/1/24, 3:25 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Here's how it works: Consider that your registration fee is $750. After you will receive the offer letter, the first part of the registration fees which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, i.e. $375 needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university (For most of the universities 15 days). Subsequently, the second part of $375 , accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
30/1/24, 3:26 PM - Ashi Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for February 10th , 2024, and your registration fee stands at $750, you'll need to make a payment of $375 on or before February 10th , 2024. The remaining $375  should be paid by March 10th, 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
30/1/24, 3:27 PM - +263 77 408 4142: Yes I have 
Nothing to inquire about
30/1/24, 3:29 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
30/1/24, 3:31 PM - +263 77 408 4142: No I don't
30/1/24, 3:31 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright dear, Please share your national Id with me
30/1/24, 3:34 PM - +263 77 408 4142: <Media omitted>
30/1/24, 3:37 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your National Id with me, So, are you excited to initiate the process? For the current round of admissions, only 31 scholarship seats are available and hence let us begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the payment plan offered for the registration fee. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
30/1/24, 3:40 PM - +263 77 408 4142: Yes I am
30/1/24, 3:43 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation and with your approval, we will now proceed with the preparations for the application and submit it to the universities recommended by the academic board, tailored to your chosen course.

As you already know, we recently had a Meet and Greet Seminar in Harare, interacting with our students and their parents, and it was heartening to see them leave with smiles on their faces. I would like to share a few glimpses of the seminar with you, which demonstrates how enthusiastic and engaged our students were!
