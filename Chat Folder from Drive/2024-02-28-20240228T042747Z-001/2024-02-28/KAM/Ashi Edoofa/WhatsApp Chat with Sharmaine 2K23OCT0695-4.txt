12/2/24, 9:25 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Sharmaine, I hope you had a good weekend!
12/2/24, 9:27 AM - Ashi Edoofa: In regards to our last conversation, I would like to share an update with you all. There was a discrepancy in the records due to the technical issues, we have verified your payment on 31st of January, and corrected our records and informed the university officials accordingly. To make sure we are on the same page, I am sharing the amount you have paid for the registration process for Sharmaine.
12/2/24, 9:28 AM - Ashi Edoofa: 1. On 22nd of December, you have paid $154 
2. On 02nd of January,  you have paid $154
3. On 16th of January,  you have paid $99 
4. On 31st of January,  you have paid $201
5. On 1st of February,  you have paid $60 
6. On 4th of February,  you have paid $117
Total amount you have paid is $785 towards Sharmaine's Registration. As the registration fees is $1000, considering that you have a grant of $150 for your registration process. The remaining amount left for the registration process is $850 - $785 = $65
12/2/24, 9:28 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Kindly confirm if there is any other discrepancy
12/2/24, 9:36 AM - +27 74 649 0272: I am not sure how u guys  do the calculations on this  because as far as we are concerned we don't owe any thing on Sharmaine as of now for the reg
12/2/24, 9:37 AM - +27 74 649 0272: u send us this  and we cleared it all
12/2/24, 9:39 AM - +27 74 649 0272: so i am not following your calculations procedures now for us to still owe this much $65.
12/2/24, 9:43 AM - +27 74 649 0272: $65 its to much balance to still awe on an amount of $407 after paying R7700. Even if the rate is up it can't be with this margin
12/2/24, 9:44 AM - +27 74 649 0272: How much exactly is $407 in Indiaan  Currents
12/2/24, 9:45 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright, Let me help you understand here that the remaining balance for Sharmaine is $443, not $407, you can also go through the above message for your reference. When making the payment for the registration fees, the exchange rate can vary, which might have caused some confusion. I have shared the detailed breakdown to help you understand the amount you have paid and the date of payment.
12/2/24, 9:58 AM - +27 74 649 0272: *Meaning the cleared balance is for Shantelle* Good Evening Parents and Shantelle ,

I trust this message finds you well and in high spirits. As I was organizing my day today, I took the opportunity to review your scholarship application file. I observed that the remaining amount of $407 for your university registration fee is due. Consequently, I wanted to reach out to inquire about your preparations. 

How is your preparation going forward? Have you been able to raise the outstanding amount of $407 by now?
12/2/24, 9:58 AM - +27 74 649 0272: If so i will understand
12/2/24, 10:00 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Please read the above messages @27746490272, It clearly mentions that the $407 if for Shantelle.
12/2/24, 10:00 AM - Ashi Edoofa: This message is for Sharmaine please
12/2/24, 10:05 AM - +27 74 649 0272: Did u also check this
12/2/24, 10:08 AM - +27 74 649 0272: me after you sent this i thought you joint the two accounts and thats why underneath this message i answered to you that we will be abel to pat $400 now as we did
12/2/24, 10:09 AM - +27 74 649 0272: Preceicly.
12/2/24, 10:10 AM - Ashi Edoofa: @27746490272 I am not able to understand what you mean by joining the two accounts here, could you please help me understand the same ?
12/2/24, 10:13 AM - +27 74 649 0272: Did you send mi this  dear
12/2/24, 10:14 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Exactly, So the remaining amount for both of your child was $850 right ? <This message was edited>
12/2/24, 10:15 AM - +27 74 649 0272: How this
12/2/24, 10:15 AM - +27 74 649 0272: because $400+$450= $850
12/2/24, 10:16 AM - Ashi Edoofa: I am sorry, Let me correct it
12/2/24, 10:28 AM - +27 74 649 0272: Pliz
12/2/24, 10:29 AM - +27 74 649 0272: let mi know when you are done
12/2/24, 10:29 AM - Ashi Edoofa: I have corrected it already please
12/2/24, 10:35 AM - +27 74 649 0272: Moving forward  here as it was on the Sharmaine and Shantelle's registration balances. We take it to say  we have cleared  Shantelle's Balances of $407. Henceforth we are left with Sharmaine's $443  which we are working on it now and by monthend we are planning to clear it if all went well financially
12/2/24, 10:36 AM - +27 74 649 0272: is this so
12/2/24, 10:37 AM - Ashi Edoofa: @27746490272 Do you want me to shift the paid amount for Shantelle ?
12/2/24, 10:39 AM - +27 74 649 0272: Pliz so that we will know that we have settled one
12/2/24, 10:42 AM - Ashi Edoofa: That would be understandable however once you have made the payment, we immediately informed the university officials. You can be rest assured that we are here for you. If you have any other confusion, please do let me know.
12/2/24, 10:45 AM - +27 74 649 0272: Just a  quick request;Can pliz confirm for me about the total balance left for both two for the fees this year  want to cross check my records
12/2/24, 10:47 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Sure @27746490272, May I know if you want me to share about the registration fees only, or for the total cost of education needed this year which means after their arrival ?
12/2/24, 10:51 AM - +27 74 649 0272: Total cost needed after their arrival
12/2/24, 10:59 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright, I would like us to get on the same page, hence I am sharing the remaining amount needed for the registration and after their arrival both. 

For the registration process, 
The remaining amount left for Sharmaine Makwara is $65
The remaining amount left for Shantelle Makwara is $407
12/2/24, 10:59 AM - Ashi Edoofa: For the amount needed after their arrival, I am sure you remember that the cost of education for first year is $1850 although from the second the cost of education will be $1600. Now, as you must have complete the registration procedure which means the amount needed for the first year will be $1850 - $1000 = $850. This amount can be paid in two installments of $425 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $425 will be due in the month of January next year. *There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments*, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
12/2/24, 11:11 AM - +27 74 649 0272: Ok thank you this is also according to my records. Thanks once again.
12/2/24, 11:12 AM - Ashi Edoofa: You are most welcome @27746490272, I am glad to know that we are on the same page.
12/2/24, 11:13 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, I want to understand what are your plans for the remaining registration fees, could you please share ?
12/2/24, 11:18 AM - +27 74 649 0272: Will let you know soon  after monthend
12/2/24, 11:22 AM - Ashi Edoofa: I understand @27746490272, I believe you were planning to clear the balance by this month end, right ?
