8/2/24, 7:34 PM - +265 991 59 81 60: Kindly explain the process thank you
8/2/24, 7:44 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -
8/2/24, 7:44 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
8/2/24, 7:44 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.
8/2/24, 7:44 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I hope these two steps are clear.
8/2/24, 7:46 PM - +265 991 59 81 60: Yes they are
8/2/24, 7:56 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps-
8/2/24, 7:56 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
8/2/24, 7:56 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.
8/2/24, 7:56 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I hope you are following?
9/2/24, 8:40 AM - +265 991 59 81 60: I am following thank you
9/2/24, 11:41 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Joseph, I hope you are doing well!
9/2/24, 11:41 AM - Ashi Edoofa: In reference to our discussion yesterday, I'd like to inquire if you are currently available to engage with us to move ahead with our discussion?
9/2/24, 11:43 AM - +265 991 59 81 60: Good afternoon
9/2/24, 11:45 AM - +265 991 59 81 60: Yes we can proceed
9/2/24, 11:48 AM - Ashi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps-
9/2/24, 11:48 AM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of *$500 to $1000.* Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
9/2/24, 11:48 AM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.
9/2/24, 11:48 AM - Ashi Edoofa: I hope these are clear as well?
9/2/24, 11:52 AM - +265 991 59 81 60: It is clear
9/2/24, 11:53 AM - Ashi Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for the further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
9/2/24, 11:54 AM - +265 991 59 81 60: Yes we can start
9/2/24, 11:55 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
9/2/24, 11:55 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually. 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
9/2/24, 11:58 AM - +265 991 59 81 60: Please do so
9/2/24, 12:00 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright, Let me share the videos with you. I am sure you must be excited for the videos.
9/2/24, 12:00 PM - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
9/2/24, 12:00 PM - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
9/2/24, 12:01 PM - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
9/2/24, 12:01 PM - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
9/2/24, 12:01 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection. 

Please go through the 4 videos, our next session will be scheduled after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarize your understanding. Hence I would like to know by when do you think you will be able to go through these videos so that we can schedule our next session accordingly?
10/2/24, 12:55 PM - +265 883 80 68 83: I'm Joseph Jungubawa responding to the 4 videos, first of all I would like to apologize for getting late to respond actually we are experiencing rainy season so electricity problems occur oftenly so my phone was offline because of voltage problem. 

Responding to the first video, I have learned that a successful edoofian student needs to have some qualities like listening skills and open minded, this is so because each stage in the Edoofa program it contains instructions so there's a need for an Edoofa student to follow and understand the instructions for him or her to be successful in the program. 

Based on the second video, I have learned that the aim of Edoofa program isn't just to make adimissions into the universities but it's vision for us students is to provide us with higher quality education services at an affordable cost and also to train us with employability skills so as to gain experience before finding a job. Through scholarship credits system Edoofa makes education services to all dedicated and hardworking students. 


Responding to third video, I have learned that Edoofa scholarships are different in other scholarships found in the world I'm saying so because Edoofa team has worked almost 10 years so as to evaluate and analyze best universities which can work with them so as to accomplish the the dream of every deserving student, this simply means being under the umbrella of Edoofa expensive education is affordable and this is the dream of every student. Through Edoofa I have learned that there are also some agents of scholarships which their aim is just to make business not to offer quality education to the deserving students, the other thing I have also learned is that despite learning in universities offered by the Edoofa program there is also hidden curriculum for example culture, edoofian students there are going to learn culture like Hori, which is a festival of colours where you express love, gratitude and friendship.The other thing is Edoofa team trains its students how to display themselves during interviews despite having knowledge in their program. 



Based on the fourth video, I have learned that despite the fact that the Edoofa program have gathered the details of their students based on their vision, skills, strength, academic experience, achievement, reason for choosing their program and the university there is also a need for an Edoofa student to be able to desplay himself or herself  before the adimmission board so as to convince them,this can help to get good percentage scholarship. 

To conclude with, these are some of the most important points I have learned upon going through the four videos you sent.
10/2/24, 12:57 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Joseph, I hope you are doing well!
10/2/24, 12:58 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing such thoughtful insights with me, Let me also add to each video that you watched and help you summarize a few additional insights:
10/2/24, 12:58 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 1: Important Message for Enrolled Students*

The first video underscores the importance of two crucial qualities: open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions. Edoofa's vision for its students is to foster success in their careers, and promote responsibility, and independence. A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.
10/2/24, 12:58 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s Vision for You*

Edoofa's vision for its students is to provide them with employment opportunities and the skills necessary to become future leaders. The program places students above other candidates by investing significant time and effort into finding reputable, education-focused institutions rather than solely business-oriented ones.
10/2/24, 12:58 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

In the third video, it is highlighted that Edoofa's founders have dedicated over a decade to meticulously identify reputable educational institutions. Students are advised to cultivate the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to excel in the job market. All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to student's career goals.
10/2/24, 12:58 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools. It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.
10/2/24, 12:59 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In summary, these videos emphasize the significance of qualities such as open-mindedness, following instructions, and cooperation. Edoofa's vision is to empower students for successful careers and leadership roles by carefully selecting educational institutions. The SOP is a vital tool for effective communication and admission success. 

I hope you agree with all of this and were able to understand these by watching the four videos?
10/2/24, 1:03 PM - +265 883 80 68 83: Good afternoon, we're fine and you
10/2/24, 1:03 PM - +265 883 80 68 83: OK thanks sir

12/2/24, 12:17 PM - +265 883 80 68 83: A physiotherapist works with patients to help them manage pain, balance, mobility and motor function.

12/2/24, 12:45 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete the two tasks that have been provided to you, we will have completed the second step of your university admission process. At that point, we will be prepared to move on to the third step, which involves understanding the registration process. Could you kindly confirm when you will be able to complete these tasks and reconnect with us? This will allow us to schedule our discussion accordingly.
12/2/24, 1:19 PM - +265 991 59 81 60: I can confirm that task have been completed
12/2/24, 1:22 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Have you submitted the SOP form ?

13/2/24, 10:55 AM - Ashi Edoofa: That's fine dear
13/2/24, 11:01 AM - +265 883 80 68 83: Thanks
13/2/24, 11:34 AM - +265 991 59 81 60: <Media omitted>
13/2/24, 11:35 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for providing your response. With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey. we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*.
13/2/24, 11:35 AM - Ashi Edoofa: However, before we do the same, I was going through your scholarship application file and noticed that you are supposed to make the payment of your remaining part of Edoofa Enrollment fee before 06th March, 2024. Hence, I thought of sharing a gentle reminder with you and try to understand how your preparation has been so far? Have you been able to align your preparations in the right direction?
13/2/24, 11:43 AM - +265 991 59 81 60: Yes we are fully aware of the same and as family we are optimistic that we shall be able to submit before the deadline. Thank you for kindly reminding us we appreciate your care thank you
13/2/24, 12:01 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. We will reconnect with each other a few days before your due date to take a follow up on this and understand your preparations better.
13/2/24, 12:01 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In the meantime, let us move forward with our discussion. To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is *Bachelor of Physiotherapy* and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
13/2/24, 12:13 PM - +265 991 59 81 60: I can confirm that the information is accurate
13/2/24, 12:14 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
13/2/24, 12:14 PM - Ashi Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
13/2/24, 12:14 PM - Ashi Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
13/2/24, 12:15 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
13/2/24, 12:18 PM - +265 991 59 81 60: It is indeed not possible to study at a multiple universities
13/2/24, 12:18 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
13/2/24, 12:18 PM - Ashi Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $1000. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
13/2/24, 12:18 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
13/2/24, 12:21 PM - +265 991 59 81 60: yes it was discussed
13/2/24, 12:22 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $1200 to $1800 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
13/2/24, 12:24 PM - +265 991 59 81 60: Yes we are
13/2/24, 12:25 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

1. *Tuition Fee*: $650 per annum
2. *Accommodation Fee*: $0 per annum (100% Sponsorship)
3. *Remaining Fee Components*: [Library Fee, Examination Fee, EDB and Book Bank, International Student Development Fund, 24-Hour WiFi Cost, Maintenance Fee, Water Bill, and Electricity Bill]: $1000 per annum

*Total Fee: Tuition Fee $650 + Accommodation Fee $0 + Remaining Fee Components $1000 = $1650 per annum.*
13/2/24, 12:26 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Registration Fee to be paid: $1000 (deadline within two weeks of issue of the offer letter, part of the university’s first-year fee and will be adjusted against the first-year cost of education $1650). I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?
13/2/24, 12:30 PM - +265 991 59 81 60: Well noted we can proceed
13/2/24, 12:31 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $1000, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $1000 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $1650 as per the above example.
13/2/24, 12:32 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $1650 - $1000 = $650 . This amount can be paid in two installments of $325 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $325 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
13/2/24, 12:34 PM - +265 991 59 81 60: Noted
13/2/24, 12:35 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
13/2/24, 12:35 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
13/2/24, 12:35 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
13/2/24, 12:37 PM - +265 991 59 81 60: Noted we can proceed
13/2/24, 12:39 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
13/2/24, 12:42 PM - +265 991 59 81 60: I have no query everything has been ably explained
13/2/24, 12:42 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright please, Now with this, we are done with step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
13/2/24, 12:42 PM - Ashi Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one.
13/2/24, 12:42 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.

13/2/24, 12:47 PM - +265 991 59 81 60: Fantastic what a joyful day it was
13/2/24, 12:48 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Yes, indeed. The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
13/2/24, 12:48 PM - Ashi Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received special news for the students of the 2024 admission intake. May I know if you are excited to know the news we have for you?
13/2/24, 12:50 PM - +265 991 59 81 60: I can wait to hear the good news
13/2/24, 12:51 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am happy to see that you are excited. After speaking with thousands of students and parents who completed their admission process before you, we realized that the current economic situation in African countries makes it a bit challenging for parents to pay the full registration fee at once.
13/2/24, 12:51 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In response to the same challenge, we had a detailed discussion with the academic board and university official. As a result, we developed a solution to alleviate the financial burden of the parents specifically for the registration fee due of $500 to $1000. <This message was edited>
13/2/24, 12:51 PM - +265 991 59 81 60: Please kindly dhare
13/2/24, 12:51 PM - Ashi Edoofa: We at Edoofa are thrilled about this development, and I believe it will significantly help all of our students and their families. Are you aware of the solution?
13/2/24, 12:51 PM - +265 991 59 81 60: Please kindly share
13/2/24, 12:53 PM - +265 991 59 81 60: I am not aware please share
13/2/24, 12:53 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That is alright, let me share the same. With respect to the conversation we had with the academic board and the university officials, we requested them to allow the students to make the payment of their registration fee in two parts within a span of 45 days thereby reducing the financial pressure.
13/2/24, 12:53 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Here's how it works: Consider that your registration fee is $1000. After you will receive the offer letter, the first part of the registration fees which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, i.e. $500 needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university (For most of the universities 15 days). Subsequently, the second part of $500, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
13/2/24, 12:53 PM - Ashi Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for February 15, 2024, and your registration fee stands at $1000, you'll need to make a payment of $500 on or before February 15, 2024. The remaining $500 should be paid by March 15, 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
13/2/24, 12:57 PM - +265 991 59 81 60: This is very clear and I should thank the Board for the kind consideration
13/2/24, 12:57 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Indeed dear, Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
13/2/24, 12:58 PM - +265 991 59 81 60: So far no query
13/2/24, 12:59 PM - Ashi Edoofa: So,  are you excited to initiate the process? For the current round of admissions, only 31 scholarship seats are available and hence let us begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the payment plan offered for the registration fee. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
13/2/24, 1:01 PM - +265 991 59 81 60: Very excited indeed, along time dream seems to be unfolding thanks to Edoofa
13/2/24, 1:02 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation and with your approval, we will now proceed with the preparations for the application and submit it to the universities recommended by the academic board, tailored to your chosen course.
