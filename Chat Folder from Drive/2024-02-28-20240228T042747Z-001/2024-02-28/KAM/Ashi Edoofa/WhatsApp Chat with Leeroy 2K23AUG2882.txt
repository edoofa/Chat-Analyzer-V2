22/2/24, 12:34 PM - +263 77 362 7367: Good morning. I am making a follow up on Leeroy Mahuni's University offer letter.

22/2/24, 12:35 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Morning @263773627367 How are you doing ?
22/2/24, 12:36 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing a follow up with us, I would like to share that the process is going on and will share the offer letter with you soon.
22/2/24, 12:37 PM - +263 77 362 7367: OK thanks.
22/2/24, 12:39 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Regarding the query about the payment method to pay $200 towards the registration fees. I would like to share them with you. If you are planning to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
22/2/24, 12:39 PM - Ashi Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
22/2/24, 12:39 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
22/2/24, 12:40 PM - +263 77 362 7367: OK noted, thanks I am out of Harare.
22/2/24, 12:42 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alternatively, You can pay the amount through Mr. Charles's FBC Bank Account.

If you want to use the same mode of payment for your university registration fee, you can do that as well since it would be feasible and the International Transfer Charges are 12.5% of the amount you want to send. Shall I share the account details with you once again for your reference?
22/2/24, 1:14 PM - +263 77 362 7367: OK, noted thanks
22/2/24, 1:18 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Let me do the same. If making the payment through Mr. Charle’s is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -
