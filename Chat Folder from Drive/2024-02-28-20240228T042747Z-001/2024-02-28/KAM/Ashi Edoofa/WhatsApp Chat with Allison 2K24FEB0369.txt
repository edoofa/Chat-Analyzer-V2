10/2/24, 1:15 PM - +263 71 669 8958: Yes I am done.
10/2/24, 1:15 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -
10/2/24, 1:15 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
10/2/24, 1:16 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.
10/2/24, 1:16 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I hope these two steps are clear?
10/2/24, 1:17 PM - +263 71 669 8958: Yes...., we can proceed.
10/2/24, 1:18 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps-
10/2/24, 1:18 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
10/2/24, 1:18 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.
10/2/24, 1:18 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I hope you are following?
10/2/24, 1:20 PM - +263 71 669 8958: Yes..., I am following.
10/2/24, 1:20 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps-
10/2/24, 1:20 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of *$500 to $1000.* Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
10/2/24, 1:20 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.
10/2/24, 1:20 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I hope these are clear as well?
10/2/24, 1:22 PM - +263 71 669 8958: Yes....., it's clear.
10/2/24, 1:22 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for the further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
10/2/24, 1:22 PM - +263 71 669 8958: Yes...., we can proceed.
10/2/24, 1:24 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
10/2/24, 1:25 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually. 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?

10/2/24, 7:16 PM - +263 71 669 8958: *Summation of all the videos.*

Children should be teachable and open minded and they must follow Edoofa instructions. The Founders have seen the problems which bother students from going to high school and one of them is they cannot afford the Tuition. In response to that they solved the problem by creating the scholarship program "Edoofa". They realised that there are students who are elite and open minded but could not afford the tuition so they gave scholarship credits to such students and they also offer part time services. They also emphasised that the students must be coachable.. The Edoofa is not just to get students affordable quality education and making students employable through the SEELS program it's also focused on increasing capacity to success thus making students more responsible and indipendent. The Edoofa program fill the students with the knowledge about the business landscape through the program of Earn While You Learn.

12/2/24, 7:21 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Allison, Wishing you a good day!
12/2/24, 7:22 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your National Id and some amazing insights about the videos with us, I am really impressed with the same.
12/2/24, 7:22 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Let me also add to each video that you watched and help you summarize a few additional insights:
12/2/24, 7:22 AM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 1: Important Message for Enrolled Students*

The first video underscores the importance of two crucial qualities: open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions. Edoofa's vision for its students is to foster success in their careers, and promote responsibility, and independence. A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.
12/2/24, 7:22 AM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s Vision for You*

Edoofa's vision for its students is to provide them with employment opportunities and the skills necessary to become future leaders. The program places students above other candidates by investing significant time and effort into finding reputable, education-focused institutions rather than solely business-oriented ones.
12/2/24, 7:22 AM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

In the third video, it is highlighted that Edoofa's founders have dedicated over a decade to meticulously identify reputable educational institutions. Students are advised to cultivate the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to excel in the job market. All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to student's career goals.
12/2/24, 7:22 AM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools. It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.
12/2/24, 7:22 AM - Ashi Edoofa: In summary, these videos emphasize the significance of qualities such as open-mindedness, following instructions, and cooperation. Edoofa's vision is to empower students for successful careers and leadership roles by carefully selecting educational institutions. The SOP is a vital tool for effective communication and admission success. 

I hope you agree with all of this and were able to understand these by watching the four videos?
12/2/24, 8:04 AM - +263 71 669 8958: Yes I agree.
12/2/24, 8:08 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing, Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
12/2/24, 8:13 AM - +263 71 669 8958: Yes we are on the same page.

So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by tomorrow 12:30 PM.
12/2/24, 8:14 AM - Ashi Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier.

12/2/24, 8:25 AM - +263 71 669 8958: Ok, thank you.
12/2/24, 8:26 AM - Ashi Edoofa: You are welcome dear
13/2/24, 8:23 AM - +263 71 669 8958: Good morning...... Sorry for replying a bit late. The network is very low this side.
13/2/24, 8:24 AM - +263 71 669 8958: <Media omitted>
13/2/24, 9:28 AM - +263 71 669 8958: 2. The difference between rights and duties is  rights are things that people are entitled to while duties are things that people are obligated to do for example people have the right to free speech but they also have the duty to respect the right of others.

3. A prosecutor is a lawyer who represents the government in a criminal case. A prosecutor is a type of attorney but not all attorneys are prosecutors. An attorney is a person who is licensed to practice law while a prosecutor is an attorney who works for the government and bring criminal charges against defendants. So all prosecutors are attorneys and all attorneys are prosecutors.

4. I am a business minded person who believes that the economy of the country depends upon correct and honest business practices and correctly incorporated companies. As I mentioned earlier in the audio I  led an anti drug campaign and exposed drugs syndicates so in business there are people who take and sell drugs under the name of a company which is not good. So there is need for someone who know the rights and help those people, such people need to be enlightened with the right  information. 

5. The skills I believe will make me a successful lawyer are I am a good listener, I listen to people and understand their perspectives and I am able to craft persuasive arguments. I am a good writer as well, I am highly motivated and willing to go an extra mile to pursue my goals.. An example is I once led a drug campaign on anti drug abuse and rehabilitation program at my former school and my community of residents. Many students and community members left drugs and started focusing on their education as well as exposing about three drugs distribution sindicates. The success was good but it could have been  better if there was no limit in the resources and legislation to clear drugs completely off the streets.

17/2/24, 8:05 AM - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
18/2/24, 8:37 PM - +263 71 669 8958: Good evening. I didn't manage to take the pictures but I was there and wrote the test. I also managed to  interact with Mr Angad and Mr with them and the rest of the team as well. I did have a great time there. About the presentation it was so good to see the experience of others who are already there. The videos really motivated me and I am looking forward to go as well and experience the lives they are also experiencing there.
19/2/24, 8:28 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Allison
19/2/24, 8:28 AM - Ashi Edoofa: I am so happy to see your excitement, I would to connect with you today and move ahead with the same motivation
19/2/24, 8:52 AM - +263 71 669 8958: Ok..., when will we connect. I mean at what time?
19/2/24, 9:05 AM - Ashi Edoofa: We can connect now if you are free dear
19/2/24, 9:07 AM - +263 71 669 8958: Yes we can connect.
19/2/24, 9:11 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright, With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey. we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*.
19/2/24, 9:11 AM - Ashi Edoofa: However, before we do the same, I was going through your scholarship application file and noticed that you are supposed to make the payment of your remaining part of Edoofa Enrollment fee before 12th March, 2024. Hence, I thought of sharing a gentle reminder with you and try to understand how your preparation has been so far? Have you been able to align your preparations in the right direction?
19/2/24, 9:13 AM - +263 71 669 8958: Yes thank you for reminding me. I will pay by month end or the first week of March.
19/2/24, 9:14 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. We will reconnect with each other a few days before your due date to take a follow up on this and understand your preparations better.
19/2/24, 9:14 AM - +263 71 669 8958: Ok.
19/2/24, 9:14 AM - Ashi Edoofa: In the meantime, let us move forward with our discussion. To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is *BA LLB* and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
19/2/24, 9:15 AM - +263 71 669 8958: Yes...., it's correct.
19/2/24, 9:15 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
19/2/24, 9:16 AM - Ashi Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
19/2/24, 9:16 AM - Ashi Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
19/2/24, 9:16 AM - Ashi Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
19/2/24, 9:19 AM - +263 71 669 8958: Yes I agree and I understand.
19/2/24, 9:20 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
19/2/24, 9:20 AM - Ashi Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $1000. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
19/2/24, 9:20 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
19/2/24, 9:26 AM - +263 71 669 8958: Yes he discussed it with me.
19/2/24, 9:31 AM - Ashi Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $1200 to $1800 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
19/2/24, 9:35 AM - +263 71 669 8958: Yes we are on the same page.
19/2/24, 9:36 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

1. *Tuition Fee*: $650 per annum
2. *Accommodation Fee*: $0 per annum (100% Sponsorship)
3. *Remaining Fee Components*: [Library Fee, Examination Fee, EDB and Book Bank, International Student Development Fund, 24-Hour WiFi Cost, Maintenance Fee, Water Bill, and Electricity Bill]: $1000 per annum

*Total Fee: Tuition Fee $650 + Accommodation Fee $0 + Remaining Fee Components $1000 = $1650 per annum.*
19/2/24, 9:36 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Registration Fee to be paid: $1000 (deadline within two weeks of issue of the offer letter, part of the university’s first-year fee and will be adjusted against the first-year cost of education $1650). I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?
19/2/24, 9:42 AM - +263 71 669 8958: Yes  I have taken note of the example.
19/2/24, 9:44 AM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $1000, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $1000 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $1650 as per the above example.
19/2/24, 9:44 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $1650 - $1000 = $650 . This amount can be paid in two installments of $325 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $325 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
19/2/24, 9:48 AM - +263 71 669 8958: Ok, I understand.
19/2/24, 9:48 AM - Ashi Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
19/2/24, 9:48 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
19/2/24, 9:48 AM - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
19/2/24, 9:51 AM - +263 71 669 8958: Ok, I am following.
19/2/24, 9:52 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
19/2/24, 9:54 AM - +263 71 669 8958: I don't have any questions for now.
19/2/24, 9:56 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright please, Now with this, we are done with step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
19/2/24, 9:56 AM - Ashi Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one.
19/2/24, 9:56 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
19/2/24, 9:58 AM - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
19/2/24, 10:01 AM - +263 71 669 8958: Ok. So about the admission card I will receive it after the offer letter or....?
19/2/24, 10:05 AM - Ashi Edoofa: You will first receive the offer letter and once you complete the registration formalities then you will receive the admission letter
19/2/24, 10:05 AM - Ashi Edoofa: The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
19/2/24, 10:05 AM - Ashi Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received special news for the students of the 2024 admission intake. May I know if you are excited to know the news we have for you?
19/2/24, 10:07 AM - +263 71 669 8958: Ok...., I understand.
19/2/24, 10:45 AM - +263 71 669 8958: Yes I am excited.
19/2/24, 10:49 AM - Ashi Edoofa: I am happy to see that you are excited. After speaking with thousands of students and parents who completed their admission process before you, we realized that the current economic situation in African countries makes it a bit challenging for parents to pay the full registration fee at once.
19/2/24, 10:50 AM - Ashi Edoofa: In response to the same challenge, we had a detailed discussion with the academic board and university official. As a result, we developed a solution to alleviate the financial burden of the parents specifically for the registration fee due of $500 to $1000.
19/2/24, 10:50 AM - Ashi Edoofa: We at Edoofa are thrilled about this development, and I believe it will significantly help all of our students and their families. Are you aware of the solution?
19/2/24, 10:53 AM - +263 71 669 8958: No I am not.
19/2/24, 10:53 AM - +263 71 669 8958: You can explain further.
19/2/24, 10:53 AM - Ashi Edoofa: That is alright, let me share the same. With respect to the conversation we had with the academic board and the university officials, we requested them to allow the students to make the payment of their registration fee in two parts within a span of 45 days thereby reducing the financial pressure.
19/2/24, 10:53 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Here's how it works: Consider that your registration fee is $1000. After you will receive the offer letter, the first part of the registration fees which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, i.e. $500 needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university (For most of the universities 15 days). Subsequently, the second part of $500, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
19/2/24, 10:54 AM - Ashi Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for February 28, 2024, and your registration fee stands at $1000, you'll need to make a payment of $500 on or before February 28, 2024. The remaining $500 should be paid by March 28, 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
19/2/24, 10:55 AM - +263 71 669 8958: I have understood.
19/2/24, 11:01 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
19/2/24, 11:01 AM - +263 71 669 8958: I don't have any queries for the meantime.
19/2/24, 11:02 AM - +263 71 669 8958: We can proceed.
19/2/24, 11:28 AM - Ashi Edoofa: So, are you excited to initiate the process? For the current round of admissions, only 31 scholarship seats are available and hence let us begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the payment plan offered for the registration fee. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
19/2/24, 11:48 AM - +263 71 669 8958: Yes I am excited.
19/2/24, 11:52 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation and with your approval, we will now proceed with the preparations for the application and submit it to the universities recommended by the academic board, tailored to your chosen course.
