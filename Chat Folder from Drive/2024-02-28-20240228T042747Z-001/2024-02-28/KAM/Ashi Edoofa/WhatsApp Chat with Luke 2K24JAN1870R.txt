30/1/24, 4:22 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
30/1/24, 4:22 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

30/1/24, 4:24 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

30/1/24, 4:27 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually.

In the third video, it is highlighted that Edoofa's founders have dedicated over a decade to meticulously identify reputable educational institutions. Students are advised to cultivate the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to excel in the job market. All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to student's career goals.
30/1/24, 6:19 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools. It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.
30/1/24, 6:20 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In summary, these videos emphasize the significance of qualities such as open-mindedness, following instructions, and cooperation. Edoofa's vision is to empower students for successful careers and leadership roles by carefully selecting educational institutions. The SOP is a vital tool for effective communication and admission success. 

I hope you agree with all of this and were able to understand these by watching the four videos?

31/1/24, 8:32 AM - +263 77 944 5802: 2.Rights and duties are two sides of the same coin.  Rights give people the freedom to do something, while duties require people to do something for example people have the right to freedom but they also have the duty to respect other people. Human rights are the basic rights that all people have, such as the right to life, liberty, and security.  Civil rights are the rights that people have within a specific society, such as the right to vote or the right to a fair trial.  Human rights are broader in scope than civil rights, and are based on the idea that all people are equal and should be treated with dignity and respect.  Civil rights are specific to a particular society and may be different from one society  For example, the right to freedom of speech is a right that people have, while the duty to obey the law is a duty that people have.  The right to vote is a right, while the duty to pay taxes is a duty.  In general, rights give people the freedom to do something, while duties require people to do something.
31/1/24, 8:36 AM - +263 77 944 5802: 3.A prosecutor is a lawyer who represents the state or government in criminal cases.  They're sometimes called district attorneys or state's attorneys, depending on the jurisdiction.  The job of a prosecutor is to present the case against the defendant and try to convince the jury or judge that the defendant is guilty.  They work with law enforcement to gather evidence and build their case, and they present their case in court.  They also have the responsibility to make sure that the defendant's rights are respected throughout the process while an An attorney, also known as a lawyer, is someone who has been trained and licensed to practice law.  Attorneys may represent clients in a variety of legal matters, such as criminal defense, civil litigation, or family law.  Attorneys may also work in other areas of law, such as corporate law or public interest law.  In order to become an attorney, a person must complete a law degree from an accredited law school and pass a state bar examination.  Attorneys are bound by a code of ethics that requires them to act in the best interests of their clients and to adhere to the highest standards of professional conduct.
31/1/24, 8:46 AM - +263 77 944 5802: 4. I find that civil law is often the most complex and challenging.  Civil law deals with a wide range of issues, and the rules and regulations can be extremely detailed and nuanced.  This makes civil law particularly interesting, as it requires a deep understanding of the law and the ability to analyze complex legal questions.  I also find that civil law often deals with issues that have a significant impact on people's lives, such as personal injury cases and contract disputes.  This makes it a particularly rewarding area to study and understand.One of the main reasons I find civil law particularly intriguing is that it often involves balancing competing interests.  For example, in a personal injury case, the injured party may be seeking compensation for their injuries, while the party who is allegedly responsible for the injuries may be trying to limit their liability.  This requires careful analysis of the facts of the case and a nuanced understanding of the law.
31/1/24, 8:59 AM - +263 77 944 5802: 5.I have skills that I think they suit me to be a successful lawyer .I have good communication skills both orally and writing but especially writing. I also think on my feet and I quickly respond to new information which I think it is needed for new information and developments while solving a case . furthermore I'm also good at time management and in everything I do I value time the most and this may help me to be punctual .Punctuality is an important skill for a lawyer for a few reasons.  First, lawyers often have busy schedules with multiple appointments throughout the day.  If a lawyer is not punctual, they may miss important meetings or deadlines, which could have serious consequences for their clients.  In addition, punctuality is important for maintaining the trust and confidence of clients.  Clients want to know that their lawyer is reliable and that they can depend on them to be there when they are needed.  Finally, punctuality is important for maintaining a good reputation within the legal profession.  A lawyer who is known for being punctual is more
31/1/24, 12:51 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Luke, Wishing you a good day!
31/1/24, 12:51 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your response regarding the SOP form and academic questions.  With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey.
31/1/24, 12:52 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Before we proceed to the next stage, I'd like to assist you in getting started with your EWYL Journey. Based on your EWYL application form, you are scheduled to commence your EWYL journey on Tuesday (06-Feb-2024).
31/1/24, 12:52 PM - Ashi Edoofa: With your intention and commencement date in mind, we have already communicated this information to the EWYL team. They are prepared to initiate your EWYL program on Tuesday, as previously agreed upon.

To kickstart the process, your dedicated EWYL Mentor has established your EWYL Group and shared the invitation link with us. Here's what you and your parents/guardian/sponsor need to do:

Wishing you all the best as you begin this exciting chapter. May it be filled with learning, personal growth, and, above all, a genuine sense of accomplishment.
1/2/24, 12:36 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Luke, I hope you are doing well!
1/2/24, 12:36 PM - Ashi Edoofa: As we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey. we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*.
1/2/24, 12:36 PM - Ashi Edoofa: May I know if you are ready for the further discussion ?
1/2/24, 12:40 PM - +263 77 944 5802: Yes I am
1/2/24, 12:43 PM - Ashi Edoofa: before we do the same, I was going through your scholarship application file and noticed that you are supposed to make the payment of your remaining part of Edoofa Enrollment fee before 25th February, 2024. Hence, I thought of sharing a gentle reminder with you and try to understand how your preparation has been so far? Have you been able to align your preparations in the right direction?
1/2/24, 12:44 PM - +263 77 944 5802: Everything will be ready before the 24th of February
1/2/24, 12:54 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. We will reconnect with each other a few days before your due date to take a follow up on this and understand your preparations better.
1/2/24, 12:54 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In the meantime, let us move forward with our discussion. To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is *BA LLB* and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
1/2/24, 1:20 PM - +263 77 944 5802: Absolutely
1/2/24, 1:36 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
1/2/24, 1:36 PM - Ashi Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
1/2/24, 1:36 PM - Ashi Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
1/2/24, 1:37 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
1/2/24, 1:48 PM - +263 77 944 5802: I got it 👍
1/2/24, 1:49 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
1/2/24, 1:49 PM - Ashi Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $1000. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
1/2/24, 1:49 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
1/2/24, 1:51 PM - +263 77 944 5802: Correct
1/2/24, 1:58 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $1200 to $1800 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
1/2/24, 1:59 PM - +263 77 944 5802: We are
1/2/24, 2:00 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

1. *Tuition Fee*: $650 per annum
2. *Accommodation Fee*: $0 per annum (100% Sponsorship)
3. *Remaining Fee Components*: [Library Fee, Examination Fee, EDB and Book Bank, International Student Development Fund, 24-Hour WiFi Cost, Maintenance Fee, Water Bill, and Electricity Bill]: $1000 per annum

*Total Fee: Tuition Fee $650 + Accommodation Fee $0 + Remaining Fee Components $1000 = $1650 per annum.*
1/2/24, 2:01 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Registration Fee to be paid: $1000 (deadline within two weeks of issue of the offer letter, part of the university’s first-year fee and will be adjusted against the first-year cost of education $1650). I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?
1/2/24, 2:04 PM - +263 77 944 5802: Yes have take note
1/2/24, 2:08 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $1000, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $1000 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $1650 as per the above example.
1/2/24, 2:08 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $1650 - $1000 = $650 . This amount can be paid in two installments of $325 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $325 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
1/2/24, 2:11 PM - +263 77 944 5802: Understood
1/2/24, 2:11 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
1/2/24, 2:11 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
1/2/24, 2:11 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
1/2/24, 2:13 PM - +263 77 944 5802: Well noted
1/2/24, 2:13 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
1/2/24, 2:15 PM - +263 77 944 5802: No questions yet
1/2/24, 2:15 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright please, Now with this, we are done with step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
1/2/24, 2:15 PM - Ashi Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one.
1/2/24, 2:16 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
1/2/24, 2:16 PM - +263 77 944 5802: Yes they are excited
1/2/24, 2:17 PM - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
1/2/24, 2:26 PM - +263 77 944 5802: Okay
1/2/24, 2:26 PM - Ashi Edoofa: The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
1/2/24, 2:26 PM - Ashi Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received special news for the students of the 2024 admission intake. May I know if you are excited to know the news we have for you?
1/2/24, 2:29 PM - +263 77 944 5802: I'm excited
1/2/24, 2:30 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am happy to see that you are excited. After speaking with thousands of students and parents who completed their admission process before you, we realized that the current economic situation in African countries makes it a bit challenging for parents to pay the full registration fee at once. 

In response to the same challenge, we had a detailed discussion with the academic board and university official. As a result, we developed a solution to alleviate the financial burden of the parents specifically for the registration fee due of $500 to $1000.
1/2/24, 2:30 PM - Ashi Edoofa: We at Edoofa are thrilled about this development, and I believe it will significantly help all of our students and their families. Are you aware of the solution?
1/2/24, 2:44 PM - +263 77 944 5802: I'm not
1/2/24, 2:45 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That is alright, let me share the same. With respect to the conversation we had with the academic board and the university officials, we requested them to allow the students to make the payment of their registration fee in two parts within a span of 45 days thereby reducing the financial pressure.
1/2/24, 2:45 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Here's how it works: Consider that your registration fee is $1000. After you will receive the offer letter, the first part of the registration fees which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, i.e. $500 needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university (For most of the universities 15 days). Subsequently, the second part of $500, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
1/2/24, 2:45 PM - Ashi Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for February 15, 2024, and your registration fee stands at $1000, you'll need to make a payment of $500 on or before February 15, 2024. The remaining $500 should be paid by March 15, 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
1/2/24, 2:52 PM - +263 77 944 5802: No
1/2/24, 2:52 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
1/2/24, 2:53 PM - +263 77 944 5802: Admission 500-100
1/2/24, 2:55 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Correct,  are you excited to initiate the process? For the current round of admissions, only 31 scholarship seats are available and hence let us begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the payment plan offered for the registration fee. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
1/2/24, 2:55 PM - +263 77 944 5802: Higher education 1200-1800
1/2/24, 2:56 PM - +263 77 944 5802: I am excited
1/2/24, 2:56 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation and with your approval, we will now proceed with the preparations for the application and submit it to the universities recommended by the academic board, tailored to your chosen course. 

Once we receive updates from the universities, we will quickly reconnect with you and share all the relevant information.
