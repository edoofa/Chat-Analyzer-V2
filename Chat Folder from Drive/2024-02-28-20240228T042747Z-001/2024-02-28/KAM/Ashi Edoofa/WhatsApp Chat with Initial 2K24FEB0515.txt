In reference to our discussion yesterday, I'd like to inquire if you are currently available to engage with us to move ahead with our discussion?
22/2/24, 12:42 PM - +263 78 555 7328: Yes
22/2/24, 12:43 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -
22/2/24, 12:43 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
22/2/24, 12:43 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.
22/2/24, 12:43 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I hope these two steps are clear?
22/2/24, 12:45 PM - +263 78 555 7328: Yes they are
22/2/24, 12:46 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps-
22/2/24, 12:46 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
22/2/24, 12:46 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.
22/2/24, 12:46 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I hope you are following?
22/2/24, 12:48 PM - +263 78 555 7328: Yes i am
22/2/24, 12:48 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps-
22/2/24, 12:48 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of *$500 to $1000.* Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
22/2/24, 12:48 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.
22/2/24, 12:48 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I hope these are clear as well?
22/2/24, 12:49 PM - +263 78 555 7328: Yes
22/2/24, 12:50 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for the further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
22/2/24, 12:51 PM - +263 78 555 7328: Yes
22/2/24, 12:51 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
22/2/24, 12:51 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually. 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
22/2/24, 12:53 PM - +263 78 555 7328: Ok
22/2/24, 12:54 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright, Let me share the videos with you. I am sure you must be excited for the videos

22/2/24, 12:55 PM - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
22/2/24, 12:55 PM - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
22/2/24, 12:55 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection. 

Please go through the 4 videos, our next session will be scheduled after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarize your understanding. Hence I would like to know by when do you think you will be able to go through these videos so that we can schedule our next session accordingly?
22/2/24, 12:55 PM - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
22/2/24, 12:57 PM - +263 78 555 7328: I have a poor network connection so maybe after an hour or so
22/2/24, 12:58 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright dear, Once you have gone through the videos please do let me know
22/2/24, 12:59 PM - +263 78 555 7328: Ok
23/2/24, 12:12 PM - +263 78 555 7328: Done and it was truly remarkable
26/2/24, 8:20 AM - +263 78 555 7328: Morning
26/2/24, 9:03 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Initial, How was your weekend ?
26/2/24, 9:03 AM - Ashi Edoofa: I am pleased to know that you were able to go through all the videos. If you don't mind, could you please share your understanding of all four videos with me so that I can assist you in expanding upon them and help you ensure you are on the right path in your educational journey?
26/2/24, 9:04 AM - +263 78 555 7328: Fine
26/2/24, 9:05 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright dear, Have you gone through my above message ?
26/2/24, 9:08 AM - +263 78 555 7328: What i noticed about the videos is that they provide an insight of our journey to India and provision of what will be taking place as well as different programs to take place such  as the EWYL
26/2/24, 9:13 AM - Ashi Edoofa: That is correct. Let me add to each video that you watched and help you summarize a few additional insights:
26/2/24, 9:14 AM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 1: Important Message for Enrolled Students*

The first video underscores the importance of two crucial qualities: open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions. Edoofa's vision for its students is to foster success in their careers, and promote responsibility, and independence. A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.
26/2/24, 9:14 AM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s Vision for You*

Edoofa's vision for its students is to provide them with employment opportunities and the skills necessary to become future leaders. The program places students above other candidates by investing significant time and effort into finding reputable, education-focused institutions rather than solely business-oriented ones.
26/2/24, 9:14 AM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

In the third video, it is highlighted that Edoofa's founders have dedicated over a decade to meticulously identify reputable educational institutions. Students are advised to cultivate the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to excel in the job market. All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to student's career goals.
26/2/24, 9:14 AM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools. It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.
26/2/24, 9:14 AM - Ashi Edoofa: In summary, these videos emphasize the significance of qualities such as open-mindedness, following instructions, and cooperation. Edoofa's vision is to empower students for successful careers and leadership roles by carefully selecting educational institutions. The SOP is a vital tool for effective communication and admission success. 

I hope you agree with all of this and were able to understand these by watching the four videos?
26/2/24, 9:19 AM - +263 78 555 7328: Yes
26/2/24, 9:25 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Brilliant, Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
26/2/24, 9:26 AM - +263 78 555 7328: Yes we are
26/2/24, 9:28 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by tomorrow 12:30 PM.
26/2/24, 9:28 AM - Ashi Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

26/2/24, 9:29 AM - Ashi Edoofa: 2. I am sharing two documents with you. Kindly go through both documents and submit your responses to the course document here in the group. Make sure you research well before starting the task. All the best!
26/2/24, 9:29 AM - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
26/2/24, 9:29 AM - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
26/2/24, 9:29 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete the two tasks that have been provided to you, we will have completed the second step of your university admission process. At that point, we will be prepared to move on to the third step, which involves understanding the registration process. Could you kindly confirm when you will be able to complete these tasks and reconnect with us? This will allow us to schedule our discussion accordingly.
26/2/24, 9:29 AM - +263 78 555 7328: Ok
26/2/24, 9:30 AM - +263 78 555 7328: Ok
26/2/24, 9:31 AM - Ashi Edoofa: By when you will be able to complete the task ?
26/2/24, 9:45 AM - +263 78 555 7328: <Media omitted>
26/2/24, 9:51 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright dear

26/2/24, 11:23 AM - +263 78 555 7328: 2. Soil fertility is the ability of soil to sustain plant growth and optimize crop yield. This can be enhanced through organic and inorganic fertilizers to the soil. Nuclear techniques provide data that enhances soil fertility and crop production while minimizing the environmental impact.Advancing food security and environmental sustainability in farming systems requires an integrated soil fertility management approach that maximizes crop production while minimizing the mining of soil nutrient reserves and the degradation of the physical and chemical properties of soil that can lead to land degradation, including soil erosion. Such soil fertility management practices include the use of fertilizers, organic inputs, crop rotation with legumes and the use of improved germplasm, combined with the knowledge on how to adapt these practices to local conditions.An integrated soil fertility management aims at maximizing the efficiency of the agronomic use of nutrients and improving crop productivity. This can be achieved through the use of grain legumes, which enhance soil fertility through biological nitrogen fixation, and the application of chemical fertilizers.

Whether grown as pulses for grain, as green manure, as pastures or as the tree components of agro-forestry systems, a key value of leguminous crops lies in their ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, which helps reduce the use of commercial nitrogen fertilizer and enhances soil fertility. Nitrogen-fixing legumes are the basis for sustainable farming systems that incorporate integrated nutrient management.
26/2/24, 11:23 AM - +263 78 555 7328: 3. In summary, several types of farming systems can be classified based on their scale, intensity, and purpose. These include subsistence farming, commercial farming, organic farming, agroforestry,  sustainable agricilture and precision farming.subsistence farming, form of farming in which nearly all of the crops or livestock raised are used to maintain the farmer and the farmer's family, leaving little, if any, surplus for sale or trade. Preindustrial agricultural peoples throughout the world have traditionally practiced subsistence farming.Commercial agriculture can be defined as farming that focuses on producing agricultural products for sale in the market rather than solely for subsistence purposes. It represents a significant shift from traditional farming practices, where small-scale farmers primarily grew crops or raised livestock to meet their needs. In commercial ag, the main objective is to generate profit by maximizing yields and efficiently utilizing resources.Commercial agriculture often involves large-scale production, where economies of scale come into play.
Advanced technology and mechanization are also integral to commercial agriculture, allowing for increased productivity and efficiency. Additionally, commercial ag involves specialization and selecting crops based on market demand, integration with global supply chains and agribusiness corporations’ involvement.Organic farming is a system of agricultural production based on the use of natural processes and resources — no chemicals (e.g. fertilisers or pesticides) or genetically modified organisms (GMOs) are used — in order to obtain healthier and more nutritious food while protecting soil fertility, preventing the spread of any diseases.Sustainable agriculture is farming in sustainable ways meeting society's present food and textile needs, without compromising the ability for current or future generations to meet their needs. It can be based on an understanding of ecosystem services.Precision agriculture (PA) is the science of improving crop yields and assisting management decisions using high technology sensor and analysis tools. PA is a new concept adopted throughout the world to increase production, reduce labor time, and ensure the effective management of fertilizers and irrigation processes.Agroforestry is a land use management system in which combinations of trees or shrubs are grown around or among crops or pastureland. Agroforestry combines agricultural and forestry technologies to create more diverse, productive, profitable, healthy, and sustainable land-use systems.

Pesticide means any substance, or mixture of substances of chemical or biological ingredients intended for repelling, destroying or controlling any pest, or regulating plant growth'. Pesticide is a more general term than Plant Protection Product (PPP).Plant protection products are 'pesticides' that protect crops or desirable or useful plants.Some pros of pesticides are the higher yield of crops, larger profits for farmers, and cheaper food for consumers. Some cons to pesticides are bioaccumulation of chemicals in organisms, genetic resistance to chemicals in pesticides, and biomagnification in the food chain.On the other hand, the disadvantages to widespread pesticide use are significant. They include domestic animal contaminations and deaths, loss of natural antagonists to pests, pesticide resistance, Honeybee and pollination decline, losses to adjacent crops, fishery and bird losses, and contamination of groundwater.Pesticide use has many benefits, including controlling harmful pests, diseases and invasive plants that can impact crops and the natural environment. But pesticide use can potentially have harmful environmental impacts as well, particulary when a pesticide moves outside of the intended application site.Effective in fighting pests in agriculture and controlling mosquitoes and insects in homes.On the other hand they Adversely affect non-target organisms, disrupt the balance of nature, and have negative effects on human and animal health.Unfortunately, this is not the case, so the controversy of use and abuse of pesticides has surfaced. The rampant use of these chemicals, under the adage, “if little is good, a lot more will be better” has played havoc with human and other life forms.
26/2/24, 11:23 AM - +263 78 555 7328: 5. Today's agriculture routinely uses sophisticated technologies such as robots, temperature and moisture sensors, aerial images, and GPS technology. These advanced devices and precision agriculture and robotic systems allow businesses to be more profitable, efficient, safer, and more environmentally friendly.Farmers no longer have to apply water, fertilizers, and pesticides uniformly across entire fields. Instead, they can use the minimum quantities required and target very specific areas, or even treat individual plants differently. Benefits include: Higher crop productivity.Different new traits are needed for different crops in different areas, whether greater resilience to heat, drought or flooding, quicker growth to cope with shorter growing seasons, or ability to tolerate saltwater intrusion from rising sea levels.

Increasingly precise techniques for genetically modifying crops promise to deliver varieties that can help farmers to keep pace with climate change. The term “precision agriculture” covers a range of technologies that generate and analyse data to help farmers optimise inputs such as water and fertiliser. Using algorithms that combine information from satellite imagery, drone footage, weather forecasts and data from sensors in soil, farmers can understand day-by-day and field-by-field how their crops are doing and what inputs they need.Algorithms can crunch through historical climate data and project how growing conditions in a particular area are likely to evolve. This can help governments to advise farmers on which varieties or crops they should consider moving away from, and which they should start to grow instead.Algorithms can crunch through historical climate data and project how growing conditions in a particular area are likely to evolve.

26/2/24, 11:24 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your response regarding the SOP form and academic questions. With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey. we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*.
26/2/24, 11:24 AM - Ashi Edoofa: However, before we do the same, I was going through your scholarship application file and noticed that you are supposed to make the payment of your remaining part of Edoofa Enrollment fee before 13th March, 2024. Hence, I thought of sharing a gentle reminder with you and try to understand how your preparation has been so far? Have you been able to align your preparations in the right direction?
26/2/24, 11:28 AM - +263 78 555 7328: I will have paid due the stated date
26/2/24, 11:29 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. We will reconnect with each other a few days before your due date to take a follow up on this and understand your preparations better.
26/2/24, 11:30 AM - Ashi Edoofa: In the meantime, let us move forward with our discussion. To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is *B.Sc (Agriculture)* and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
26/2/24, 11:33 AM - +263 78 555 7328: Yes
26/2/24, 11:40 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
26/2/24, 11:40 AM - Ashi Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
26/2/24, 11:40 AM - Ashi Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
26/2/24, 11:40 AM - Ashi Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
26/2/24, 11:42 AM - +263 78 555 7328: Yes l am
26/2/24, 11:43 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
26/2/24, 11:43 AM - Ashi Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $1000. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
26/2/24, 11:43 AM - +263 78 555 7328: That's great
26/2/24, 11:43 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
26/2/24, 11:43 AM - +263 78 555 7328: Ok
26/2/24, 11:45 AM - +263 78 555 7328: Yes
26/2/24, 11:45 AM - Ashi Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
26/2/24, 11:47 AM - +263 78 555 7328: So what will be the final estimated amount
26/2/24, 11:51 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

1. *Tuition Fee*: $1800 per annum
2. *Food and Accommodation Fee*: $1000 per annum 

*Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum*
26/2/24, 11:51 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Registration Fee to be paid: $1000 (deadline within two weeks of issue of the offer letter, part of the university’s first-year fee and will be adjusted against the first-year cost of education $2800). I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?
26/2/24, 11:52 AM - +263 78 555 7328: Ok I understand
26/2/24, 11:54 AM - +263 78 555 7328: So I am expected to pay $1000 within two weeks of the offer letter
26/2/24, 12:58 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Yes @263785557328, We do have something special for the registration fees which will be shared with you soon in our today's session
26/2/24, 12:58 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $1000, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $1000 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
26/2/24, 12:58 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $1000 = $1800. This amount can be paid in two installments of $900 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $900 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
26/2/24, 12:59 PM - +263 78 555 7328: Ok
26/2/24, 1:01 PM - +263 78 555 7328: Ok
26/2/24, 1:04 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
26/2/24, 1:04 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
26/2/24, 1:04 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
26/2/24, 1:06 PM - +263 78 555 7328: I'll be looking forward to that
26/2/24, 1:06 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
26/2/24, 1:08 PM - +263 78 555 7328: Not yet, all good
26/2/24, 1:09 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright please, Now with this, we are done with step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
26/2/24, 1:09 PM - Ashi Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one.
26/2/24, 1:09 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
26/2/24, 1:09 PM - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
26/2/24, 1:10 PM - +263 78 555 7328: Yes
26/2/24, 1:11 PM - +263 78 555 7328: This is trulyremarkable
26/2/24, 1:18 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Yes, indeed @263785557328. The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
26/2/24, 1:18 PM - Ashi Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received special news for the students of the 2024 admission intake. May I know if you are excited to know the news we have for you?
26/2/24, 1:21 PM - +263 78 555 7328: Yes I am
26/2/24, 1:22 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am happy to see that you are excited. After speaking with thousands of students and parents who completed their admission process before you, we realized that the current economic situation in African countries makes it a bit challenging for parents to pay the full registration fee at once.
26/2/24, 1:22 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In response to the same challenge, we had a detailed discussion with the academic board and university official. As a result, we developed a solution to alleviate the financial burden of the parents specifically for the registration fee due of $500 to $1000.
26/2/24, 1:22 PM - Ashi Edoofa: We at Edoofa are thrilled about this development, and I believe it will significantly help all of our students and their families. Are you aware of the solution?
26/2/24, 1:24 PM - +263 78 555 7328: No l am not enlighten me
26/2/24, 1:29 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That is alright, let me share the same. With respect to the conversation we had with the academic board and the university officials, we requested them to allow the students to make the payment of their registration fee in two parts within a span of 45 days thereby reducing the financial pressure.
26/2/24, 1:29 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Here's how it works: Consider that your registration fee is $1000. After you will receive the offer letter, the first part of the registration fees which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, i.e. $500 needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university (For most of the universities 15 days). Subsequently, the second part of $500, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
26/2/24, 1:29 PM - Ashi Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for February 28, 2024, and your registration fee stands at $1000, you'll need to make a payment of $500 on or before February 28, 2024. The remaining $500 should be paid by March 28, 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
26/2/24, 1:31 PM - +263 78 555 7328: No quite clear
26/2/24, 1:32 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
26/2/24, 1:56 PM - +263 78 555 7328: No
26/2/24, 1:58 PM - Ashi Edoofa: So,  are you excited to initiate the process? For the current round of admissions, only 31 scholarship seats are available and hence let us begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the payment plan offered for the registration fee. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
26/2/24, 1:59 PM - +263 78 555 7328: Yes I am
26/2/24, 2:02 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation and with your approval, we will now proceed with the preparations for the application and submit it to the universities recommended by the academic board, tailored to your chosen course. 

Once we receive updates from the universities, we will quickly reconnect with you and share all the relevant information.
26/2/24, 2:02 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Throughout this process, please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. We are here to assist you and ensure that the higher education journey is meticulously planned and successful. 

Your peace of mind is of utmost importance to us, and we are fully dedicated to providing you with all the support you may require.
26/2/24, 2:03 PM - +263 78 555 7328: That's great
26/2/24, 2:04 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Have a good day ahead!
26/2/24, 2:04 PM - +263 78 555 7328: Same to you
