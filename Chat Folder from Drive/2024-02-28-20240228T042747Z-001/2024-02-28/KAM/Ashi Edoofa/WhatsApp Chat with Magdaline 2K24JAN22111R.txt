30/1/24, 7:34 PM - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>

30/1/24, 7:37 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -
30/1/24, 7:37 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
30/1/24, 7:37 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.
30/1/24, 7:37 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I hope these two steps are clear?
30/1/24, 7:42 PM - +260 760061219: Yes they are.
30/1/24, 7:42 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps-
30/1/24, 7:42 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
30/1/24, 7:43 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.
30/1/24, 7:43 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I hope you are following?
30/1/24, 7:45 PM - +260 760061219: Yes I am following.
30/1/24, 7:53 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -
30/1/24, 7:53 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process, the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
30/1/24, 7:53 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.
30/1/24, 7:53 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I hope these are clear as well?
30/1/24, 7:53 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I hope these are clear as well?

30/1/24, 7:54 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
30/1/24, 7:55 PM - +260 760061219: Yes please.
30/1/24, 7:55 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
30/1/24, 7:55 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding until you are ready, shall we start with our discussion with me individually? 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention.

31/1/24, 1:26 PM - +260 760061219: The first video talk about two qualities that are essential for a student to become a successful Edoofian. It talks about following instructions and being open minded.
The second video is about the vision of Edoofa. It wants to help students get a batter experience of education, henceforth, Edoofa helps students to study in a different country and helps them in the admission procedures.
The third video is talking about colleges schools and universities under the Edoofa program. Edoofa choses a number of schools that they can send students to, it looks at the deserving students that can be enrolled into the best schools in India.
Lastly, the last video is about 
statement of purpose. It lets students interact with universities to which they have been accepted hence, increasing chances on them getting enrolled.
31/1/24, 1:28 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Yes @260760061219 , that is correct. Let me also add to each video that you watched and help you summarize a few additional insights:
31/1/24, 1:28 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 1: Important Message for Enrolled Students*

The first video underscores the importance of two crucial qualities: open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions. Edoofa's vision for its students is to foster success in their careers, and promote responsibility, and independence. A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.
31/1/24, 1:28 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s Vision for You*

Edoofa's vision for its students is to provide them with employment opportunities and the skills necessary to become future leaders. The program places students above other candidates by investing significant time and effort into finding reputable, education-focused institutions rather than solely business-oriented ones.
31/1/24, 1:28 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

In the third video, it is highlighted that Edoofa's founders have dedicated over a decade to meticulously identify reputable educational institutions. Students are advised to cultivate the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to excel in the job market. All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to student's career goals.
31/1/24, 1:28 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools. It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.
31/1/24, 1:28 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In summary, these videos emphasize the significance of qualities such as open-mindedness, following instructions, and cooperation. Edoofa's vision is to empower students for successful careers and leadership roles by carefully selecting educational institutions. The SOP is a vital tool for effective communication and admission success. 

I hope you agree with all of this and were able to understand these by watching the four videos?

2/2/24, 1:04 PM - +260 760061219: 2. What is the importance of medical laboratory technology?

   Medical laboratory technology is important because it performs a complex tests on patients, samples using sophisticated equipment like microscopes. The data found plays an important role in identifying and treating cancer, heart disease, diabetes and other medical conditions. Laboratory techniques are very important in a researchers life. These skills play a significant role in order to perform various experiments and to run various tests. Without knowledge, one can not apply these techniques in projects and researches. These techniques are vital for most of the experiments. Medical laboratory technology is also important because it is used to diagnose diseases, monitor patient health and track the effectiveness of treatment. 
  Medical laboratory technology is also important because it monitors patient health and provides an insight into a patients health and is necessary for accurate diagnosis and effective treatment. With the advancement in technology, lab test have become more efficient, accurate and accessible.
2/2/24, 1:19 PM - +260 760061219: 3. What is good laboratory practices (GLP) and why is it followed in the lab. 

   Good laboratory practices are standard regulatory programs that assure the quality and integrity of non-clinical safety test. Good laboratory practices are also a quality system covering covering the organizational process and conditions under which non-clinical laboratory studies are planned, performed and archived.
The importance of good laboratory practices is to ensure safety data is properly obtained, organized and reported. Good laboratory practices ensure the safety and organization of pharmaceutical research. The practice is followed to maintain consistently high standards and comply with any regulations set by government agencies, internal company procedures and international regulations. Good laboratory practices also applies to non-clinical studies conducted for the assessment of the safety or efficiency of products in development including pharmaceutical for people, animals and the environment. 
    Good laboratory practice is not limited to chemicals and also applies to medical devices , food additives and other non-pharmaceutical products and electronic devices. These practices also represent different principles that are considered to confirm and encourage integrity, quality, consistency and ethics of chemicals during non-clinical and laboratory testing. It prevents cross contamination, chemical leaks and infection in the laboratory.
2/2/24, 1:43 PM - +260 760061219: 4. Mention different sterilization methods used in the lab, why are they important. Explain any one of them in details. 

     Sterilization is the process of eliminating or destroying of all forms of microbial life, including bacteria, viruses, spores and fungi on a surface or in a median. Sterilization methods are crucial to ensure the accuracy and reliability of experiments as well as to maintain a safe working environment. There are several sterilization methods that are used in the laboratory and these are; heat sterilization, filtration, radiation sterilization, chemical sterilization, and solvent sterilization. 
    Sterilization helps in destroying all micro-organisms on the surface of an article or in a fluid to prevent disease transmission associated with the use of that item. Sterilization methods also kills all forms of bacteria, diseases, fungi and viruses. Disinfection procedures before and after a medical event prevent the transmission of germs. Not only will if protect the patient but also the medical professionals.

   Radiation is an example of a sterilization method that deals with exposing the packed materials to radiation (UV, X-ray, gamma ray) for sterilization. The main difference between different radiation types is their penetration and hence their effectiveness. UV rays have low penetration and thus are less effective but it is safe and can be used for small area sterilization. X-ray and gamma rays have far more penetrating power and thus are more fancy and thus needs special attention. UV radiation is routinely used to sterilize the interiors of biological safety cabinets between X-rays are used for gamma radiation is radiation is commonly used for the sterilization of disposal of medical equipment such as syringes, needles and cannulas.
2/2/24, 2:12 PM - +260 760061219: 5. Explain a few techniques for placing samples under a microscope.

    A specimen is placed on a slide with or without a cover slope over it. This method is is useful for viewing dry specimens such as hair or pollen. Wet mount, a specimen is placed on a drop of water on the slide with s coverslip places over it. This is often used for viewing cells. Use your sterile pipette to place a liquid medium such as water onto the slide. Submerge your specimen in the fluid. If using a coverslip, rest the  edge of the coverslip against the glass slide at a 45-degree angle before slowly lowering it over your specimen using a pipette, place a drop of water on the specimen. Then place on edge of the coverslip into placing place using a toothpick or equivalent.
  This method will help prevent air bubbles from being under the coverslip. Place your sample on the stage and turn on the LED light. Look through the eyepiece and move the focus knob until the image comes into focus. Adjust the distance between the eyepiece until to you can see the sample clearly with both eyes simultaneously. 
   In a section mount, an extremely thin cross-section of a specimen is used. Using  microtome cut a thin slice of your selected specimen such as an onion and carefully see it in your slide. Then follow the instructions for a dry and wet mount. A stain can often be applied directly to the specimen before covering with a coverslip. Section mounts are suitable for useful for a wide variety of samples such as fruit, vegetables and other solids that can be cut into small slices.
2/2/24, 2:14 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the above response, Please share your SOP form as well and then we will start our session for today
2/2/24, 2:33 PM - +260 760061219: Sorry but how am I suppose to go about it?
2/2/24, 2:34 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Have you visited this link ?
2/2/24, 2:48 PM - +260 760061219: <Media omitted>
2/2/24, 2:58 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your response regarding the SOP form and academic questions.  With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey.
2/2/24, 2:59 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I was going through your scholarship application file and noticed that you are supposed to make the payment of your remaining part of Edoofa Enrollment fee before 28th February, 2024. Hence, I thought of sharing a gentle reminder with you and try to understand how your preparation has been so far? Have you been able to align your preparations in the right direction?
2/2/24, 3:00 PM - +260 760061219: Yes I have.
2/2/24, 3:01 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. We will reconnect with each other a few days before your due date to take a follow up on this and understand your preparations better.
2/2/24, 3:02 PM - +260 760061219: Sure thing.
2/2/24, 3:02 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In the meantime, let us move forward with our discussion. To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is *B.Sc (Medical Lab Technology)* and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
2/2/24, 3:03 PM - +260 760061219: Yes it is please.
2/2/24, 3:04 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
2/2/24, 3:05 PM - Ashi Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
2/2/24, 3:05 PM - Ashi Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
2/2/24, 3:05 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
2/2/24, 3:06 PM - +260 760061219: Yes.
2/2/24, 3:08 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
2/2/24, 3:08 PM - Ashi Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $1000. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
2/2/24, 3:08 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
2/2/24, 3:09 PM - +260 760061219: Yes please.
2/2/24, 3:10 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
2/2/24, 3:11 PM - +260 760061219: Yes we are please.
2/2/24, 3:12 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

1. *Tuition Fee*: $1800 per annum
2. *Food and Accommodation Fee*: $1000 per annum 

*Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum*
2/2/24, 3:12 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Registration Fee to be paid: $1000 (deadline within two weeks of issue of the offer letter, part of the university’s first-year fee and will be adjusted against the first-year cost of education $2800). I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?
2/2/24, 3:14 PM - +260 760061219: Yes please.
2/2/24, 3:15 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $1000, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $1000 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
2/2/24, 3:15 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $1000 = $1800. This amount can be paid in two installments of $900 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $900 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
2/2/24, 3:18 PM - +260 760061219: Can the registration fee be paid in installments as well?
2/2/24, 3:22 PM - Ashi Edoofa: @260760061219 I will assist this query of yours soon as we have something exciting regarding the same.
2/2/24, 3:22 PM - Ashi Edoofa: As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
2/2/24, 3:22 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
2/2/24, 3:22 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
2/2/24, 3:25 PM - +260 760061219: Sure thing.
2/2/24, 3:25 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
2/2/24, 3:30 PM - +260 760061219: No, I don’t have any queries.
2/2/24, 3:30 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright please, Now with this, we are done with step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
2/2/24, 3:30 PM - Ashi Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one.
2/2/24, 3:30 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
2/2/24, 3:30 PM - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
2/2/24, 3:51 PM - +260 760061219: Thank you.
2/2/24, 4:20 PM - Ashi Edoofa: The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
2/2/24, 4:21 PM - Ashi Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received special news for the students of the 2024 admission intake. May I know if you are excited to know the news we have for you?
2/2/24, 4:24 PM - +260 760061219: Yes I am please.
2/2/24, 4:25 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am happy to see that you are excited. After speaking with thousands of students and parents who completed their admission process before you, we realized that the current economic situation in African countries makes it a bit challenging for parents to pay the full registration fee at once. 

In response to the same challenge, we had a detailed discussion with the academic board and university official. As a result, we developed a solution to alleviate the financial burden of the parents specifically for the registration fee due of $500 to $1000.
2/2/24, 4:25 PM - Ashi Edoofa: We at Edoofa are thrilled about this development, and I believe it will significantly help all of our students and their families. Are you aware of the solution?
2/2/24, 4:26 PM - +260 760061219: Not really.
2/2/24, 4:26 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That is alright, let me share the same. With respect to the conversation we had with the academic board and the university officials, we requested them to allow the students to make the payment of their registration fee in two parts within a span of 45 days thereby reducing the financial pressure.
2/2/24, 4:26 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Here's how it works: Consider that your registration fee is $1000. After you will receive the offer letter, the first part of the registration fees which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, i.e. $500 needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university (For most of the universities 15 days). Subsequently, the second part of $500, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
2/2/24, 4:26 PM - Ashi Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for February 15, 2024, and your registration fee stands at $1000, you'll need to make a payment of $500 on or before February 15, 2024. The remaining $500 should be paid by March 15, 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
2/2/24, 4:28 PM - +260 760061219: Nothing else please.
2/2/24, 4:29 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
2/2/24, 4:29 PM - +260 760061219: No please.
2/2/24, 4:29 PM - Ashi Edoofa: So, are you excited to initiate the process? For the current round of admissions, only 31 scholarship seats are available and hence let us begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the payment plan offered for the registration fee. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
2/2/24, 4:31 PM - +260 760061219: Yes.
2/2/24, 4:31 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation and with your approval, we will now proceed with the preparations for the application and submit it to the universities recommended by the academic board, tailored to your chosen course. 

Once we receive updates from the universities, we will quickly reconnect with you and share all the relevant information.
2/2/24, 4:32 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Throughout this process, please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. We are here to assist you and ensure that the higher education journey is meticulously planned and successful. 

Your peace of mind is of utmost importance to us, and we are fully dedicated to providing you with all the support you may require.
