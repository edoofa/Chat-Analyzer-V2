Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process, the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
3/2/24, 1:57 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

7/2/24, 2:13 PM - +263 71 683 1649: <Media omitted>
7/2/24, 2:22 PM - +263 71 683 1649: Entrepreneurship is important to the economic development.The benefits yo the society will be greater in economies where entrepreneurs can operate flexibly, develop their ideas and reap the rewards.Also entrepreneurs respond to the high regulatory barriers by moving to more innovation -friendly countries or by turning from productivity activities to non wealth creating activities.Entreprenuers has positive relationship to the economy,they lead to economic development since they increase the Gross Domestic Product.In addition entrepreneurs can be creative and start their own business which has a pivotal role to economic development.Entreprenuers are particularly innovative and are vital to the competitiveness of the economy.Entreprenuers helps to reduce the rate of unemployment and this helps to develop our economy.When the economy is doing well, there's less incentives to encourage new entrepreneurial firms because when people and firms are making money, they can not take risk  in something new this will lead to decline in our economy.When unemployment is high and the economy is contracting or stagnating, dynamic entrepreneurship could turn the economy around.By developing new products or increasing competition,new firms can boost demand, which could in turn create new job opportunities and reduce unemployment. So generally when there is high rate in entrepreneurship there will be high economic development.
7/2/24, 2:23 PM - +263 71 683 1649: Question 2
7/2/24, 2:23 PM - +263 71 683 1649: I am doing good how are you
7/2/24, 2:23 PM - +263 71 683 1649: Thanks for asking
7/2/24, 2:31 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am fine dear, thank you. May I know by when you will be able to share your response for the academic questions ?
7/2/24, 2:38 PM - +263 71 683 1649: Yes now i am typing question 3
7/2/24, 2:38 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright dear
7/2/24, 2:39 PM - +263 71 683 1649: 3)GAAP is the setoff accounting rules set forth by the financial accounting standards Board (FASB ) that U.S companies are expected to follow when putting together their statements  The goal of GAAP is to ensure that a company's financial statements are complete ,consistent and comparable .GAAP maybe contrasted with proforma accounting which is a non-GAAP financial reporting method .GAAP is used mainly in the U.S ,while most other countries follow the international financial reporting standards( IFRS).
GAAP is also used by states and other government entities in the US in preparing their financial statements. According to the financial accounting foundation ,all 50 states adhere to GAAP and many require that local entities, such as countries, cities ,towns and school districts do so as well .
Without GAAP comparing financial statements of different companies would be extremely difficult even within the same industry, making an apples -to-apples comparison hard .Some companies may use both GAAP and non-GAAP resources when reporting their financial results
7/2/24, 3:53 PM - +263 71 683 1649: 4)  Accounting standards are authorative standard for financial reports and are the primary source of generally accepted accounting principles.These accounting standards specify how transaction and other events are to be recognized, measured , presented and disclosed in financial statements.Accounting standard improves the transparency of financial reporting in all countries .Intercompanies follow the IFRS which are set by the international accounting standard board and serve as the guideline for companies in preparing their financial statements .The generally accepted accounting principles are heavily used among public and private entities in the United States.The international accounting standard board establishes and interpret the international communities accounting standard when preparing financial statements.Also accounting standard relate to all aspects of an entities finance including assets, liabilities,revenue, expenses and shareholders equity .

7/2/24, 4:54 PM - +263 71 683 1649: 5) Accounting is a specialised language of business which helps to understand the economic activities of the entity whereas auditing is a methodical procedure of independently examining the financial information of an entity with the aim of giving an opinion on true and fair view.The purpose of accounting is to show the performance, profitability and financial position of an organization whereas the purpose of auditing is to reveal the fact ,that to wich extent financial statements of an organization gives true and fair view.

7/2/24, 5:14 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your response regarding the SOP form and academic questions.  With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey.
7/2/24, 5:14 PM - Ashi Edoofa: However, before we do the same, I was going through your scholarship application file and noticed that you are supposed to make the payment of your remaining part of Edoofa Enrollment fee before 01st March, 2024. Hence, I thought of sharing a gentle reminder with you and try to understand how your preparation has been so far? Have you been able to align your preparations in the right direction?
7/2/24, 6:08 PM - +263 71 683 1649: Yaa thank you
7/2/24, 6:09 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. We will reconnect with each other a few days before your due date to take a follow up on this and understand your preparations better.
7/2/24, 6:09 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In the meantime, let us move forward with our discussion. To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is *BCom* and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
7/2/24, 6:10 PM - +263 71 683 1649: Yes
7/2/24, 6:10 PM - +263 71 683 1649: Okay
7/2/24, 6:10 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
7/2/24, 6:10 PM - Ashi Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
7/2/24, 6:10 PM - Ashi Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
7/2/24, 6:10 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
7/2/24, 6:13 PM - +263 71 683 1649: Noted
7/2/24, 6:14 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
7/2/24, 6:14 PM - Ashi Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $1000. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
7/2/24, 6:14 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
7/2/24, 6:17 PM - +263 71 683 1649: Yes they did
7/2/24, 6:17 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
7/2/24, 6:22 PM - +263 71 683 1649: Yaa they explained
7/2/24, 6:23 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

1. *Tuition Fee*: $1800 per annum
2. *Food and Accommodation Fee*: $1000 per annum 

*Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum*
7/2/24, 6:23 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Registration Fee to be paid: $1000 (deadline within two weeks of issue of the offer letter, part of the university’s first-year fee and will be adjusted against the first-year cost of education $2800). I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?
7/2/24, 6:24 PM - +263 71 683 1649: Noted
7/2/24, 6:25 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $1000, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $1000 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
7/2/24, 6:25 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $1000 = $1800. This amount can be paid in two installments of $900 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $900 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
7/2/24, 6:28 PM - +263 71 683 1649: Noted
7/2/24, 6:29 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
7/2/24, 6:29 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
7/2/24, 6:29 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
7/2/24, 6:34 PM - +263 71 683 1649: Does the visa fee deducted from first year fees
7/2/24, 6:35 PM - Ashi Edoofa: No dear, The Visa fees is not included in your first year fees
7/2/24, 6:35 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
7/2/24, 6:55 PM - +263 71 683 1649: No it's clear
7/2/24, 7:05 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright please, Now with this, we are done with step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
7/2/24, 7:06 PM - Ashi Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one.
7/2/24, 7:06 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
7/2/24, 7:06 PM - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
7/2/24, 7:11 PM - +263 71 683 1649: Okay thank you
7/2/24, 7:12 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Welcome, The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
7/2/24, 7:12 PM - Ashi Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received special news for the students of the 2024 admission intake. May I know if you are excited to know the news we have for you?
7/2/24, 7:14 PM - +263 71 683 1649: Yea can you share the good news
7/2/24, 7:15 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am happy to see that you are excited. After speaking with thousands of students and parents who completed their admission process before you, we realized that the current economic situation in African countries makes it a bit challenging for parents to pay the full registration fee at once.
7/2/24, 7:15 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In response to the same challenge, we had a detailed discussion with the academic board and university official. As a result, we developed a solution to alleviate the financial burden of the parents specifically for the registration fee due of $500 to $1000.
7/2/24, 7:15 PM - Ashi Edoofa: We at Edoofa are thrilled about this development, and I believe it will significantly help all of our students and their families. Are you aware of the solution?
7/2/24, 7:18 PM - +263 71 683 1649: No
7/2/24, 7:21 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That is alright, let me share the same. With respect to the conversation we had with the academic board and the university officials, we requested them to allow the students to make the payment of their registration fee in two parts within a span of 45 days thereby reducing the financial pressure.
7/2/24, 7:21 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Here's how it works: Consider that your registration fee is $1000. After you will receive the offer letter, the first part of the registration fees which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, i.e. $500 needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university (For most of the universities 15 days). Subsequently, the second part of $500, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
7/2/24, 7:21 PM - Ashi Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for February 15, 2024, and your registration fee stands at $1000, you'll need to make a payment of $500 on or before February 15, 2024. The remaining $500 should be paid by March 15, 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
7/2/24, 7:23 PM - +263 71 683 1649: No thanks
7/2/24, 7:30 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
7/2/24, 7:33 PM - +263 71 683 1649: It very clear
7/2/24, 7:34 PM - Ashi Edoofa: So,  are you excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
7/2/24, 7:35 PM - +263 71 683 1649: Yes i am very excited
7/2/24, 7:36 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation and with your approval, we will now proceed with the preparations for the application and submit it to the universities recommended by the academic board, tailored to your chosen course. 

Once we receive updates from the universities, we will quickly reconnect with you and share all the relevant information.
