16/1/24, 1:44 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Kelvin

I trust this message finds you well, and I hope you are in high spirits. In recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their A-Level results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey.
16/1/24, 1:44 PM - Ashi Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?

26/2/24, 1:37 PM - +263 78 115 1578: I hope you had a wonderful weekend as well.
26/2/24, 1:40 PM - +263 78 115 1578: The Edoofa Scholarship Program has proven rather cost efficient and helpful really,it's just that we ,including my guardians have found it difficult to endure the whole tuition fees till I finish .Thus we decided that I would rather study here in Zimbabwe where we can manage.
26/2/24, 1:42 PM - Ashi Edoofa: May I know what is the challenge regarding the tuition fees dear ?
26/2/24, 1:43 PM - +263 78 115 1578: The tuition fee is rather expensive for what my parents can afford .
26/2/24, 1:47 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I understand dear, Have you explored the other options locally ?
26/2/24, 1:48 PM - +263 78 115 1578: I did,and I have decided to pursue an Engineering course starting from this year's August.
26/2/24, 1:50 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright dear, Are you aware of the cost of education there ?
26/2/24, 1:52 PM - +263 78 115 1578: Yes sir ,for the department I shall be specializing on,it ranges between 500 to 650 US dollars per semester.
26/2/24, 1:53 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright dear, What about the cost of accommodation ?
26/2/24, 1:54 PM - +263 78 115 1578: Accommodation ranges between 70 to 120 US dollars
26/2/24, 2:18 PM - +263 78 115 1578: The real issue iam on is getting a refund on the 700 US dollars I had already paid for tuition fees. Are you able and willing to help me through the process of retrieving that money?
27/2/24, 10:07 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Kelvin, I hope you are doing well!
27/2/24, 10:09 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Please excuse me for not continuing with our discussion yesterday as I have been occupied with an urgent meeting, however I am here to connect with you today and move ahead with our discussion. May I kindly ask if you are available for the same ?
27/2/24, 11:47 AM - +263 78 115 1578: Yes ,we are available.
27/2/24, 11:47 AM - +263 78 115 1578: And good morning to you as well.
27/2/24, 12:07 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That's good to know dear, before we assist you regarding your concern, it's important for you to get the correct guidance right ?
27/2/24, 12:15 PM - +263 78 115 1578: That's true ,Mr Ashi.
27/2/24, 12:19 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to see that we share the same perspective here, could you please confirm if this accommodation cost is monthly right ?
27/2/24, 12:26 PM - +263 78 115 1578: That's right
27/2/24, 12:28 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I understand, however, let me help you explain since you mentioned that in Zimbabwe per semester fees are $500-$650 to be on the safer side let us assume it is $650, now as you must be aware each academic year consist of 2 semesters so that will make your per annum cost of $1300 only for the tuition fee. 

Now, if you goes to a university you will eventually move out and live close to the university, and for that accommodation, the cost could come up to $80 per month which will make your yearly accommodation cost $960, and moving on to the food, for a decent meal it costs $2 per meal, and for you to have 3 meals it will cost you $6 and this will also cost you yearly $600. Plus some miscellaneous costs of the examination fee which can cost up to $150 per annum.
27/2/24, 12:30 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now if we sum up the cost here, $1300 + $960 + $600 + $150 = $3010, and this will be the balance if you choose any local university and not the expensive ones and keeping in mind Zimbabwe's economy that degree will not be enough for you to make yourself employable.

However, here at Edoofa, we make sure that from the tuition fee to accommodation and food everything is covered within the $2000-$3000, and with the affordable education you will also get an international degree recognition alongside the EWYL program that specifically focuses on skill development and making students employable ready. I hope you are able to understand now?
27/2/24, 12:34 PM - +263 78 115 1578: I understand,but I will prefer here in Zimbabwe and would like a refund as well
27/2/24, 12:38 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That's truly understandable dear, I would like to know why you still want to continue in Zimbabwe while you know that the cost of education in Zimbabwe is higher than pursuing your education abroad. Moreover, we must acknowledge the current economic climate in Zimbabwe, which has led to reduced job opportunities. This reality presents an additional challenge as you contemplate your future career path right ?
27/2/24, 1:14 PM - +263 78 115 1578: You're actually right Mr Ashi ,but iam attending a polytechnic college which is much cheaper compared to universities.
27/2/24, 1:15 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I understand @263781151578, What is the cost of education there ?
27/2/24, 1:18 PM - +263 78 115 1578: At a polytechnic institute it costs about 200 US dollars as tuition fees
27/2/24, 1:20 PM - +263 78 115 1578: Unfortunately my guardians can afford catering for me here in Zimbabwe.
27/2/24, 1:21 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Per semester ?
27/2/24, 1:24 PM - +263 78 115 1578: That's correct
27/2/24, 1:25 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright dear, May I know the institute name please ?
27/2/24, 1:26 PM - +263 78 115 1578: Kwekwe polytechnic
27/2/24, 1:28 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright Kelvin, By doing the course here do you believe that you will be able to get a good employment while considering the economy there ?
27/2/24, 1:31 PM - +263 78 115 1578: I do not only believe that but I know I will get a better employment opportunities if I do.
27/2/24, 1:55 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I truly wishes the same for you dear, Since you have already complete the registration process, and only left with the tuition fees. I want to know if you are working with your mentor ?
27/2/24, 4:51 PM - +263 78 115 1578: Iam not working with my mentor and I already paid part of the tuition fee in which I want a refund of as iam leaving the Edoofa Scholarship Program
