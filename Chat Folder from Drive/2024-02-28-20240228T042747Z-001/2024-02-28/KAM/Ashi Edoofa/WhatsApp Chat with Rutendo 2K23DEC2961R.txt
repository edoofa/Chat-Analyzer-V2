23/1/24, 3:23 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
23/1/24, 3:23 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.
23/1/24, 3:23 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I hope you are following?
23/1/24, 3:25 PM - +263 78 993 1858: Yes lm following
23/1/24, 3:27 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -
23/1/24, 3:27 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process, the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
23/1/24, 3:27 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.
23/1/24, 3:27 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I hope these are clear as well?
23/1/24, 3:29 PM - +263 78 993 1858: Yes they are clear
23/1/24, 3:29 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
23/1/24, 3:29 PM - +263 78 993 1858: Yes we can start
23/1/24, 3:31 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
23/1/24, 3:31 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding until you are ready, shall we start with our discussion with me individually? 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?

I wanted to follow up regarding the videos that were shared with you yesterday. Were you able to review all four of them? I am keen to discuss them further and would greatly appreciate your feedback.
24/1/24, 12:24 PM - +263 78 993 1858: Afternoon Ms Ashi
24/1/24, 12:25 PM - +263 78 993 1858: Yes l reviewed them
24/1/24, 12:25 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am pleased to know that you were able to go through all the videos. If you don't mind, could you please share your understanding of all four videos with me so that I can assist you in expanding upon them and help you ensure you are on the right path in your educational journey?
24/1/24, 12:33 PM - +263 78 993 1858: Okay okay....
24/1/24, 12:35 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Sure dear!

24/1/24, 2:00 PM - Ashi Edoofa: @263789931858 Your voice is not understandable due to some issues
24/1/24, 2:00 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Please share your response in the text format
24/1/24, 2:01 PM - +263 78 993 1858: Okay okay
24/1/24, 2:10 PM - +263 78 993 1858: According to Video 1 l learnt tht the key traits for us to be successfuly enrolled in the Universities are ÷ Open minded like thinking outside the box  and being coachable to follow instructions.Edoofa it's not all bout giving us affordable education but it also gives us a series of career opportunities in the future.Acoording to Video 3 l learnt that Edoofa enrolls us in the best schools in India, and best interms of infrastructure,quality education,quality teaching staff which will make students pass with flying colours.Edoofa also prepares students in the real world like in the sense that they work as a team and as a community to carry out tasks.This is so because in the real world will meet with different people and with different characteristics but because of the team work trait u wll be having it will be easy working with everyone...Lastly it's the Statement of Purpose.According to my understanding it is a crucial subjective document in which students mention their key unique traits, goals , visions ,objectives just to make the Admission officers believe that you are the perfect candidate for the scholarship.
24/1/24, 2:11 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing dear, I am highly impressed with your thoughts. Before we move ahead I would like to know if you have completed the forms ?
24/1/24, 2:12 PM - +263 78 993 1858: Stll waiting for moms signatures.

24/1/24, 2:25 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In the context of your application for the Edoofa Scholarship program, a sponsor refers to an individual responsible for covering the cost of your higher education after the scholarship has been applied and hence you have to fill in the details for the same. 

For most of the students, their parents or guardians are the ones who actively support their child's education and assist them in covering their educational expenses beyond what is covered by the scholarship.
24/1/24, 2:27 PM - +263 78 993 1858: Okay okay...thank you
24/1/24, 2:34 PM - Ashi Edoofa: You are welcome @263789931858

24/1/24, 3:07 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, Let me also add to each video that you watched and help you summarize a few additional insights:
24/1/24, 3:07 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 1: Important Message for Enrolled Students*

The first video underscores the importance of two crucial qualities: open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions. Edoofa's vision for its students is to foster success in their careers, and promote responsibility, and independence. A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.
24/1/24, 3:07 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s Vision for You*

Edoofa's vision for its students is to provide them with employment opportunities and the skills necessary to become future leaders. The program places students above other candidates by investing significant time and effort into finding reputable, education-focused institutions rather than solely business-oriented ones.
24/1/24, 3:07 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

In the third video, it is highlighted that Edoofa's founders have dedicated over a decade to meticulously identify reputable educational institutions. Students are advised to cultivate the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to excel in the job market. All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to student's career goals.
24/1/24, 3:07 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools. It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.
24/1/24, 3:07 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In summary, these videos emphasize the significance of qualities such as open-mindedness, following instructions, and cooperation. Edoofa's vision is to empower students for successful careers and leadership roles by carefully selecting educational institutions. The SOP is a vital tool for effective communication and admission success. 

I hope you agree with all of this and were able to understand these by watching the four videos?
24/1/24, 3:08 PM - +263 78 993 1858: Yes l understood
24/1/24, 3:21 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Brilliant, Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
24/1/24, 3:38 PM - +263 78 993 1858: Yes we are
24/1/24, 3:50 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by tomorrow 12:30 PM.
24/1/24, 3:50 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

27/1/24, 9:39 AM - +263 78 993 1858: *QUESTION 2 ANSWER* 

UI (User Interface) and UX (User Experience) refer to two different aspects of software or application design, but they are closely related. 

UI design focuses on the visual and interactive elements of a product, aiming to create an intuitive and aesthetically pleasing interface for users. It includes the design of buttons, menus, icons, color schemes, typography, and overall layout.

UX design, on the other hand, is concerned with the overall experience users have while interacting with a product. It involves understanding user needs, conducting research, creating user personas, and designing wireframes and prototypes to ensure that the product is usable, accessible, and enjoyable.

In today's world, UI/UX design plays a vital role in creating successful and user-centered digital products. Good UI/UX design can enhance user satisfaction, improve usability, increase customer retention, and drive business success. With the proliferation of websites, mobile apps, and software, companies are recognizing the importance of investing in UI/UX design to stand out from the competition and provide an exceptional user experience.
27/1/24, 9:39 AM - +263 78 993 1858: *QUESTION 3 ANSWER* 

The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a conceptual framework that standardizes the functions of a communication system into seven layers. Each layer has a specific set of responsibilities and interacts with the layer above and below it. The model helps in understanding and designing network protocols and systems.

The seven layers of the OSI model are:

1. *Physical Layer* : This layer deals with the physical transmission of data over the network, including electrical or optical signals, connectors, cables, and hardware specifications.

2. *Data Link Layer:* The data link layer handles the reliable transmission of data frames between adjacent nodes on a network, addressing errors and controlling flow.

3. *Network Layer* : The network layer manages the logical addressing and routing of data packets over a network. It determines the best path to send data from source to destination.

4. *Transport Layer:* This layer ensures end-to-end reliable delivery and flow control of data. It breaks down large data streams into smaller segments and provides error checking and retransmission mechanisms.

5. *Session Layer:* The session layer establishes, manages, and terminates communication sessions between applications running on different devices.

6. *Presentation Layer:* The presentation layer is responsible for data translation, encryption, compression, and formatting, ensuring that data exchanged between applications is properly interpreted.

7. *Application Layer:* The application layer enables communication between end-user applications and the network. It includes protocols such as HTTP, FTP, SMTP, and DNS.

The OSI model provides a framework for understanding how different network protocols and technologies interact and communicate in a layered approach.
27/1/24, 9:39 AM - +263 78 993 1858: *QUESTION 4 ANSWER* 

Programming is the process of writing instructions or code that can be executed by a computer or another programmable device. It involves creating a set of logical steps and commands to solve a specific problem or perform a desired task. Programs are written using programming languages, which provide a structured and formal way of communicating with the computer.
Programmers use programming languages to create software applications, websites, games, mobile apps, and much more. They write code using variables, data structures, algorithms, and control flow statements to define the behavior and functionality of a program.Programming languages are formal languages designed to communicate instructions to a computer. They provide a structured and standardized way to write software programs, scripts, or applications. There are numerous programming languages, each with its own syntax, semantics, and specific purposes.They are 2 main types of programming languages thus High Level Language and Low Level Language.

A high-level programming language is a language that is designed to be easily understood by humans and provides a level of abstraction from the underlying hardware. It allows programmers to write programs in a more readable and understandable manner, without having to worry about the low-level details of the computer's architecture.
Some of the examples of high-level programming languages include:Python, Java ,C++, JavaScript.

Low-level programming languages provide a level of abstraction closer to the hardware, allowing programmers to have more control over the computer's resources. These languages are typically machine-dependent and require knowledge of the computer's specific architecture.
Examples of low-level programming languages include: Assembly language and C.

Some commonly used programming languages include:

1. Python: Python is a versatile and beginner-friendly language known for its simplicity and readability. It is widely used in web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and scientific computing.

2. Java: Java is a popular language known for its portability and versatility. It is used for creating desktop applications, Android apps, enterprise-level software, and more.
27/1/24, 9:39 AM - +263 78 993 1858: *QUESTION 5 ANSWER* 

Compilers are software's that translate's source code written in High Level Language (HLL) for example C++ into a set of machine language( 0s and 1s) instructions that cannot be understood by a digital computer before execution resulting in faster execution since no translation is needed during runtime.We have many types of compilers but let me list the three main types thus: 

*Cross**compiler*  which creates executable code for a platform other than the one on which it is running.

*Source to source* *compiler*  which is a type of translator that takes the source code written in programming language as it's input and produces equivalent source code in the same or different programming language.

*JIT*  which helps the performance of Java programs by compiling Bytecode into native machine code at run time

 *WHEREAS* interpreters translates code line by line  during execution,making it easier to detect errors but potentially slowing down the program.They are 4 main types of interpreters thus:

*Bytecode* *interpreters* are computer object codes that an interpreter converts into binary machine code so it can be read by computers processor.

 *Threaded* *Code* which is similar to Bytecode but they use pointers which points to functions or instruction sequences.

 *Abstract* *Syntax Tree* which convert the source code to an abstract syntax tree which then executes the programm according to the trees.Each sentence is parsed once. 

 *Self intepreters* which are  programming interpreters written in a programming language that can interpret itself.

27/1/24, 9:43 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Once you start with the EWYL Program and are able to connect with your mentor, please update the same here as well by sending the below message -

*Hello Admission officer, I am now in touch with my EWYL Mentor. The name of my Mentor is _________ and he/she has scheduled my session for ________*(mention the date)
27/1/24, 9:44 AM - +263 78 993 1858: Noted thank you
27/1/24, 9:47 AM - Ashi Edoofa: You are welcome dear, With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey. we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*.
27/1/24, 9:47 AM - Ashi Edoofa: However, before we do the same, I was going through your scholarship application file and noticed that you are supposed to make the payment of your remaining part of Edoofa Enrollment fee before 07th February, 2024. Hence, I thought of sharing a gentle reminder with you and try to understand how your preparation has been so far? Have you been able to align your preparations in the right direction?
27/1/24, 10:26 AM - Ashi Edoofa: May I know if you have gone through the above messages ?
27/1/24, 10:31 AM - +263 78 993 1858: Yes lm aware of that thanks for the reminder
27/1/24, 10:32 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. We will reconnect with each other a few days before your due date to take a follow up on this and understand your preparations better.
27/1/24, 10:33 AM - Ashi Edoofa: In the meantime, let us move forward with our discussion. To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is *B.Sc (Computer Science)* and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
27/1/24, 10:38 AM - +263 77 275 8388: Thank you for the reminder
27/1/24, 10:39 AM - Ashi Edoofa: You are always welcome!
27/1/24, 10:51 AM - +263 78 993 1858: Yes that is correct
27/1/24, 10:53 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for the confirmation. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
27/1/24, 10:53 AM - Ashi Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
27/1/24, 10:53 AM - Ashi Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
27/1/24, 10:53 AM - Ashi Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
27/1/24, 2:18 PM - +263 78 993 1858: Yes l agree
27/1/24, 2:18 PM - +263 78 993 1858: Noted
27/1/24, 2:19 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
27/1/24, 2:19 PM - Ashi Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $1000. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
27/1/24, 2:20 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
27/1/24, 2:22 PM - +263 78 993 1858: Yes that is correct
27/1/24, 2:22 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
27/1/24, 2:23 PM - +263 78 993 1858: Yes we are
27/1/24, 2:25 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

1. *Tuition Fee*: $1800 per annum
2. *Food and Accommodation Fee*: $1000 per annum 

*Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum*
27/1/24, 2:25 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Registration Fee to be paid: $1000 (deadline within two weeks of issue of the offer letter, part of the university’s first-year fee and will be adjusted against the first-year cost of education $2800). I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?
27/1/24, 2:27 PM - +263 78 993 1858: Noted
27/1/24, 2:27 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $1000, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $1000 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
27/1/24, 2:27 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $1000 = $1800. This amount can be paid in two installments of $900 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $900 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
27/1/24, 2:29 PM - +263 78 993 1858: Okay okay Noted
27/1/24, 2:29 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
27/1/24, 2:29 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
27/1/24, 2:29 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
27/1/24, 2:31 PM - +263 78 993 1858: Okay Noted
27/1/24, 2:31 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
27/1/24, 2:32 PM - +263 78 993 1858: No lm good...l have no questions..
27/1/24, 2:32 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright please, Now with this, we are done with step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
27/1/24, 2:32 PM - Ashi Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one.
27/1/24, 2:32 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
27/1/24, 2:33 PM - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
27/1/24, 2:34 PM - +263 78 993 1858: Wow this is nice..l can't wait☺️
27/1/24, 2:35 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Yes, indeed dear. The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
27/1/24, 2:35 PM - Ashi Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received special news for the students of the 2024 admission intake. May I know if you are excited to know the news we have for you?
27/1/24, 2:37 PM - +263 78 993 1858: Yes lm excited to know the news...
27/1/24, 2:37 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am happy to see that you are excited. After speaking with thousands of students and parents who completed their admission process before you, we realized that the current economic situation in African countries makes it a bit challenging for parents to pay the full registration fee at once. 

In response to the same challenge, we had a detailed discussion with the academic board and university official. As a result, we developed a solution to alleviate the financial burden of the parents specifically for the registration fee due of $500 to $1000.
27/1/24, 2:38 PM - Ashi Edoofa: We at Edoofa are thrilled about this development, and I believe it will significantly help all of our students and their families. Are you aware of the solution?
27/1/24, 2:39 PM - +263 78 993 1858: No lm not aware
27/1/24, 2:40 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That is alright, let me share the same. With respect to the conversation we had with the academic board and the university officials, we requested them to allow the students to make the payment of their registration fee in two parts within a span of 45 days thereby reducing the financial pressure.
27/1/24, 2:40 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Here's how it works: Consider that your registration fee is $1000. After you will receive the offer letter, the first part of the registration fees which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, i.e. $500 needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university (For most of the universities 15 days). Subsequently, the second part of $500, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
27/1/24, 2:40 PM - Ashi Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for January 29 , 2024, and your registration fee stands at $1000, you'll need to make a payment of $500 on or before January 29, 2024. The remaining $500 should be paid by February 29 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
27/1/24, 3:24 PM - +263 78 993 1858: Wow this is nice ..Thank you very much...and thank the academic board on my behalf
27/1/24, 3:59 PM - Ashi Edoofa: You are welcome dear, Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
27/1/24, 4:40 PM - +263 78 993 1858: No l have no questions
27/1/24, 4:41 PM - Ashi Edoofa: So, are you excited to initiate the process? For the current round of admissions, only 31 scholarship seats are available and hence let us begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the payment plan offered for the registration fee. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
27/1/24, 4:42 PM - +263 78 993 1858: Yes lm excited and lm ready
27/1/24, 4:44 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation and with your approval, we will now proceed with the preparations for the application and submit it to the universities recommended by the academic board, tailored to your chosen course. 

Once we receive updates from the universities, we will quickly reconnect with you and share all the relevant information.
