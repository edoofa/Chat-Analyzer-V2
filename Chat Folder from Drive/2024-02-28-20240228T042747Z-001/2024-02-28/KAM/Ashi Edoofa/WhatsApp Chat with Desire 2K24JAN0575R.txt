23/1/24, 3:31 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
23/1/24, 3:31 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.
23/1/24, 3:31 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I hope you are following?
23/1/24, 3:33 PM - +265 888 03 87 59: When will this start?
23/1/24, 3:35 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Dear, we will start with all the steps soon

23/1/24, 3:35 PM - +265 888 03 87 59: Oh okay
23/1/24, 3:47 PM - +265 888 03 87 59: Is the session over?
23/1/24, 3:52 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Let me clear your doubts dear, When you completed your enrollment in the Edoofa Scholarship program, I am sure you counselor must have shared some information about the Statement of Purpose and Academic question right ?
23/1/24, 3:56 PM - +265 888 03 87 59: Yes
23/1/24, 3:57 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to know that you remember this discussion dear, Once we will complete all the necessary for your application then we will move ahead and submit your application at multiple university. I hope that's clear ? <This message was edited>

23/1/24, 3:58 PM - +265 888 87 29 48: All these things you are requesting is like repetitive to me, which makes more confusion with in our mind that you are one and why asking same information now and again which has been already submitted
23/1/24, 4:00 PM - Ashi Edoofa: @265888872948 May I kindly know with whom you have submitted this information ?
23/1/24, 4:02 PM - +265 888 03 87 59: On the first group i was told to send the academic documents which i did,i guess that is why he is wondering why am sending it for the second time

23/1/24, 4:04 PM - +265 888 03 87 59: Yes yes....we just wanted to understand what is really going on hence asking those questions
23/1/24, 4:05 PM - Ashi Edoofa: No problem dear, You are always welcome with your queries. Let move ahead with our discussion
23/1/24, 4:05 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process, the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
23/1/24, 4:05 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.
23/1/24, 4:05 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I hope these are clear as well?
23/1/24, 4:09 PM - +265 888 03 87 59: $500 for registration? And then i will be required to pay tuition fees apon reaching india?

So the $350 is different also?

Alright
23/1/24, 4:09 PM - +265 888 03 87 59: Yes
23/1/24, 4:12 PM - Ashi Edoofa: @265888038759 The $350 is for the enrollment in Edoofa Scholarship program while the $500 - $1000 are your registration fees at the university while you don't have to worry about this fees as this is a part of your first year tuition fees it's not an additional amount

23/1/24, 4:15 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them.

23/1/24, 9:28 PM - +265 888 03 87 59: This video is talking about the statement of purpose where he talked about sending students documents to various universities and schedule the interacting sessions with us

Sending documents where they will see the qualifications,and why the universities should consider us or give us the scholarship,why you have chosen that course,why you are seeking admission at that particular school

24/1/24, 12:10 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing @265888038759 Let me also add to each video that you watched and help you summarize a few additional insights:
24/1/24, 12:10 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 1: Important Message for Enrolled Students*

The first video underscores the importance of two crucial qualities: open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions. Edoofa's vision for its students is to foster success in their careers, and promote responsibility, and independence. A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.
24/1/24, 12:11 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s Vision for You*

Edoofa's vision for its students is to provide them with employment opportunities and the skills necessary to become future leaders. The program places students above other candidates by investing significant time and effort into finding reputable, education-focused institutions rather than solely business-oriented ones.
24/1/24, 12:11 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

In the third video, it is highlighted that Edoofa's founders have dedicated over a decade to meticulously identify reputable educational institutions. Students are advised to cultivate the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to excel in the job market. All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to student's career goals.
24/1/24, 12:11 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools. It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.
24/1/24, 12:11 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In summary, these videos emphasize the significance of qualities such as open-mindedness, following instructions, and cooperation. Edoofa's vision is to empower students for successful careers and leadership roles by carefully selecting educational institutions. The SOP is a vital tool for effective communication and admission success. 

I hope you agree with all of this and were able to understand these by watching the four videos?
24/1/24, 12:19 PM - +265 888 03 87 59: Yes yes.....i followed abd nie i understand even more
24/1/24, 12:22 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Brilliant, Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
24/1/24, 12:26 PM - +265 888 03 87 59: Yes please we are on the same page
24/1/24, 12:27 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing dear, Before we move ahead I would like to know if you have connected with your school officials regarding the JCE document ?
24/1/24, 12:28 PM - +265 888 03 87 59: I do not have  their number i need to go the myself so for now is it possible to proceed without the JCE document?
24/1/24, 12:33 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Sure dear, We can proceed with our discussion at the moment. However, May I kindly know when are you planning to visit there for the document ?
24/1/24, 12:34 PM - +265 888 03 87 59: In Friday or tomorrow i will make the arrangements to go
24/1/24, 12:36 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know @265888038759 Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by tomorrow 12:30 PM.
24/1/24, 12:36 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

25/1/24, 11:54 AM - Ashi Edoofa: With your intention and commencement date in mind, we have already communicated this information to the EWYL team. They are prepared to initiate your EWYL program on Tuesday, as previously agreed upon.

To kickstart the process, your dedicated EWYL Mentor has established your EWYL Group and shared the invitation link with us. Here's what you and your parents/guardian/sponsor need to do:

https://chat.whatsapp.com/LJNeYYDHezxFQPRWpDSu8x

25/1/24, 11:57 AM - +265 888 03 87 59: Done
25/1/24, 11:58 AM - Ashi Edoofa: You can go ahead and start your journey
25/1/24, 11:59 AM - +265 888 03 87 59: From the person who referred me to the edoofa program Witness told me that we she only started the journey after knowing the school and the percentage of the scholarship,so am confused why it is different with me
25/1/24, 12:00 PM - +265 888 03 87 59: Alright will do that
25/1/24, 12:05 PM - Ashi Edoofa: No problem dear, She might have missed the EWYL date that is why she have joined her program late however the EWYL program always started the initial stage so that you can start your earning soon.
25/1/24, 12:09 PM - +265 888 03 87 59: Oh okay?
Fine
25/1/24, 12:09 PM - +265 888 03 87 59: I've joined the other group am just waiting for them to reply
25/1/24, 12:10 PM - Ashi Edoofa: With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey. we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*.
25/1/24, 12:11 PM - Ashi Edoofa: However, before we do the same, I was going through your scholarship application file and noticed that you are supposed to make the payment of your remaining part of Edoofa Enrollment fee before 11th February, 2024. Hence, I thought of sharing a gentle reminder with you and try to understand how your preparation has been so far? Have you been able to align your preparations in the right direction?
25/1/24, 12:13 PM - +265 888 03 87 59: Alright
My parents will reply on that
25/1/24, 12:14 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Sure, I will be waiting for their response
25/1/24, 12:15 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In the meantime, let us move forward with our discussion. To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is *MA Economics* and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
25/1/24, 12:15 PM - +265 888 03 87 59: Alright
25/1/24, 12:16 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
25/1/24, 12:16 PM - Ashi Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
25/1/24, 12:16 PM - Ashi Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
25/1/24, 12:16 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
25/1/24, 12:17 PM - +265 888 03 87 59: Yes please the information is accurate
25/1/24, 12:18 PM - +265 888 03 87 59: Following
25/1/24, 12:19 PM - +265 888 03 87 59: Yes that's right
25/1/24, 12:20 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
25/1/24, 12:20 PM - Ashi Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $1000. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
25/1/24, 12:20 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
25/1/24, 12:22 PM - +265 888 03 87 59: That's correct
25/1/24, 12:29 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
25/1/24, 12:31 PM - +265 888 03 87 59: Yes we are together
25/1/24, 12:32 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

1. *Tuition Fee*: $1800 per annum
2. *Food and Accommodation Fee*: $1000 per annum 

*Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum*
25/1/24, 12:32 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Registration Fee to be paid: $1000 (deadline within two weeks of issue of the offer letter, part of the university’s first-year fee and will be adjusted against the first-year cost of education $2800). I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?
25/1/24, 12:33 PM - +265 888 03 87 59: Yes am following
25/1/24, 12:37 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $1000, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $1000 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
25/1/24, 12:38 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $1000 = $1800. This amount can be paid in two installments of $900 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $900 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
25/1/24, 12:43 PM - +265 888 03 87 59: But how will one manage to pay $900 three days after coming to India? I feel like its alot of money to pay $1000, while here then $900 after arriving

Or maybe i've got it wrong?
The 1000 are we supposed to pay at once?

Or maybe you tool it as an example?
25/1/24, 12:46 PM - +265 888 03 87 59: Hello Admission officer, I am now in touch with my EWYL Mentor. The name of my Mentor is Miss Aditi and she has scheduled my session for 30,jan 2024. <This message was edited>
25/1/24, 12:47 PM - Ashi Edoofa: @265888038759 Let me share that the $1000 are needed when you will receive your offer letter from the university this amount is needed in order to reserve your scholarship seat at the university. Before your arrival in India you need to pay your first year tuition fees which is divided in the installment of $900. 

You also have the flexibility to pay this amount in monthly installment. May I know if you have any other doubt ?
25/1/24, 12:48 PM - +265 888 03 87 59: No its alright
25/1/24, 12:48 PM - +265 888 03 87 59: But i know my parents will also come and ask their questions,i believe you will answer then accordingly
25/1/24, 12:49 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Sure dear, I will be more than happy to assist them. I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
25/1/24, 12:49 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
25/1/24, 12:49 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
25/1/24, 12:57 PM - +265 888 03 87 59: Yes that i know
25/1/24, 12:58 PM - +265 888 03 87 59: And this registration fee is only paid to the university once i receive the offer letter from them
25/1/24, 12:58 PM - +265 888 03 87 59: Yes,great
25/1/24, 12:59 PM - +265 888 87 29 48: As a father I want to understand this one, are you saying we need to pay 1000 upon arrival at the university to reserve the scholarship place and 900 to ne paid as 1st year tuition fees which is totaling up to 1900 despite paying in instalment?

If this is the case it is very expensive on our end because our anticipation is that we need to know the university and scholarship % desire will be given. At the same time I not seeing your contribution as part of scholarship on the first 1000 and 900 which becomes so confusing to me.

However I would wish we know the university she is going, scholarship % given then continue with all these processes.  

I an here to be corrected otherwise the process is just so confusing seriously
25/1/24, 1:06 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your queries with me @265888872948, I will be more than happy to clear your confusion here. Let me first help you understand that the registration fees which is in the range of $500 - $1000 will be paid soon when you will receive the offer letter. The tuition fees will be needed before your arrival however there is a payment plan for both of the amount. 

Additionally, Let me also share that the above fees break shared with you is just an example not the actual cost of education. The actual cost will be shared with you when you will receive the offer letter.
25/1/24, 1:06 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I completely understand your apprehension about the registration fee, and I appreciate you reaching out. Let me provide some clarity on this matter.

You don't have to worry about paying the registration fee right now. Let me help you in understanding the process -  you'll receive multiple offers from different universities. Once you've made your final decision on which university to pursue your Higher Education, that's when we will proceed with your admission application, at that time you need to complete the registration payment.
25/1/24, 1:16 PM - +265 888 87 29 48: Noted
25/1/24, 1:17 PM - +265 888 03 87 59: Oh okay fine....i understand now
25/1/24, 1:19 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
25/1/24, 1:21 PM - +265 888 03 87 59: No...we can proceed
25/1/24, 1:23 PM - +265 888 32 08 00: As a mother am also confused thou u said it's just an example but somehow it is giving a fear that it's expensive comparing to our source of money this side,it's a concern now,as it is taking long for sessions  yet we expect university and it's sponsering  percentages.
25/1/24, 1:27 PM - Ashi Edoofa: @265888320800 I hope you are aware of these ranges are already shared with you right ?
25/1/24, 1:32 PM - +265 888 32 08 00: These ranges I'm expecting to be less as we're processing to have sponsorship not on our own even that registration of $,350 it was much to us paying in ashort time.
25/1/24, 1:34 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I respect your thoughts here @265888320800. Let me help you understand the aspect of $350 for the enrollment in Edoofa Scholarship Program 

*Enrollment fee*
The enrollment fee is $350 out of which you need to pay only $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 is to be paid in next 30 days 
 
For all the services and assistance including Applications, SOP, Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection, and sessions, etc all you need to pay is $350
25/1/24, 1:34 PM - +265 888 87 29 48: For now let us for wait Admission acceptance letter  like as you said and see what we can afford and not then we will have our final say based on what will be offered..thanks <This message was edited>
25/1/24, 1:36 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I appreciate @265888872948, However its important for us to provide you the clear information. For the cost of education, I am sure you are aware that *Cost of education* is reduced from $6000-$8000 to $2000-$3000 per annum which includes Tuition fee, Accommodation, Food, Wifi, Laundry, Library, Gym fee, etc!
 
This cost can be further reduced through the earnings from Earn While You Learn program.
25/1/24, 1:38 PM - +265 888 03 87 59: Alright...@919650537098  we can now proceed
25/1/24, 1:41 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright please, I understand. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
25/1/24, 1:41 PM - Ashi Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
25/1/24, 1:41 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
25/1/24, 1:42 PM - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
25/1/24, 1:44 PM - +265 888 03 87 59: Thank you so much
25/1/24, 1:45 PM - +265 888 03 87 59: Yes yes
25/1/24, 1:46 PM - +265 888 03 87 59: This is wonderful
So what are in the bags? Are there gifts in there?😅
25/1/24, 1:47 PM - Ashi Edoofa: You are welcome dear, Indeed there are the gift hamper for our Edoofians. I am excited to welcome you as well soon
25/1/24, 1:48 PM - Ashi Edoofa: The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
25/1/24, 1:48 PM - Ashi Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received special news for the students of the 2024 admission intake. May I know if you are excited to know the news we have for you?
25/1/24, 1:48 PM - +265 888 03 87 59: Great...
25/1/24, 1:51 PM - +265 888 03 87 59: Yes please tell us the news
25/1/24, 1:53 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am happy to see that you are excited. After speaking with thousands of students and parents who completed their admission process before you, we realized that the current economic situation in African countries makes it a bit challenging for parents to pay the full registration fee at once. 

In response to the same challenge, we had a detailed discussion with the academic board and university official. As a result, we developed a solution to alleviate the financial burden of the parents specifically for the registration fee due of $500 to $1000.
25/1/24, 1:53 PM - Ashi Edoofa: We at Edoofa are thrilled about this development, and I believe it will significantly help all of our students and their families. Are you aware of the solution?
25/1/24, 1:59 PM - +265 888 03 87 59: Not at all
25/1/24, 2:01 PM - +265 888 03 87 59: What is the solution
25/1/24, 2:03 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That is alright, let me share the same. With respect to the conversation we had with the academic board and the university officials, we requested them to allow the students to make the payment of their registration fee in two parts within a span of 45 days thereby reducing the financial pressure.
25/1/24, 2:03 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Here's how it works: Consider that your registration fee is $1000. After you will receive the offer letter, the first part of the registration fees which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, i.e. $500 needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university (For most of the universities 15 days). Subsequently, the second part of $500, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
25/1/24, 2:03 PM - Ashi Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for January 25, 2024, and your registration fee stands at $1000, you'll need to make a payment of $500 on or before January 25, 2024. The remaining $500 should be paid by February 25 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
25/1/24, 2:07 PM - +265 888 03 87 59: That's good
25/1/24, 2:08 PM - +265 888 03 87 59: Alright fine
25/1/24, 2:10 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
25/1/24, 2:11 PM - +265 888 03 87 59: No queries at all
25/1/24, 2:11 PM - Ashi Edoofa: So, are you excited to initiate the process? For the current round of admissions, only 31 scholarship seats are available and hence let us begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the payment plan offered for the registration fee. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
25/1/24, 2:13 PM - +265 888 03 87 59: I'm looking forward to that,i  can't wait to receive the offer letter
25/1/24, 2:15 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation and with your approval, we will now proceed with the preparations for the application and submit it to the universities recommended by the academic board, tailored to your chosen course. 

Once we receive updates from the universities, we will quickly reconnect with you and share all the relevant information.
25/1/24, 2:15 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Throughout this process, please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. We are here to assist you and ensure that the higher education journey is meticulously planned and successful. 

Your peace of mind is of utmost importance to us, and we are fully dedicated to providing you with all the support you may require.
25/1/24, 2:17 PM - +265 888 03 87 59: Thank you so very much
25/1/24, 2:17 PM - +265 888 03 87 59: If anything will ask
25/1/24, 2:21 PM - Ashi Edoofa: You are welcome dear, With this we are closing our conversation for today. I wish you and your family a good day ahead!

I hope you are doing well and I find you in the best of sports. As per your application file, you are supposed to make the payment of your remaining part of the Edoofa Enrollment fee of $150 by 11th February, 2024. 

Considering the same, I wanted to reach out to you, share a gentle reminder, and try to understand if you have been able to make the payment of your fee by now so that we can update the academic board accordingly?
7/2/24, 6:43 PM - +265 888 03 87 59: Good afternoon...does that mean we will only get to know the school that has given us the scholarship and the percentage after we finish paying? Am i right?
7/2/24, 6:45 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Well dear, Your application is already in the process with the university, however as you have the upcoming deadline, I wanted to understand when are you planning to complete the same ?
7/2/24, 6:47 PM - +265 888 03 87 59: Oh alright then...they will pay before the deadline am sure of that

And thank you for reminding us
7/2/24, 7:03 PM - Ashi Edoofa: You are welcome dear, I will be looking forward for the same
7/2/24, 7:03 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Have a good night ahead!
7/2/24, 7:06 PM - +265 888 03 87 59: Good night!
7/2/24, 8:32 PM - +265 888 03 87 59: Am sorry but  on this day you said we should wait for five days to receive the offer later so am wondering that the days have passed and we still haven't received the offer later till date
Maybe if you could explain to us why because we are wondering what is going on <This message was edited>
7/2/24, 8:35 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Yes @265888038759. As you are aware that A level and O level results are out now hence the university is taking some extra time to evaluate the application so that they can offer the highest percentage to the student. Kindly don't worry as your application is already in process
7/2/24, 8:38 PM - +265 888 87 29 48: Exactly, as above our anticipation was to have it within those 3 to 5 days but to our surprise, you are reminding the 150 usd yet the other side is silent, which becomes so worrisome seriously for us to complete the payment.  

If I  am to ask, how long does it take to complete your process for a student to know the school as well as the percentage given?

Parent
7/2/24, 8:43 PM - Ashi Edoofa: @265888872948 I truly understand your thoughts here, However I hope your can understand that the evaluation take time as we don't want our students to miss any crucial opportunity for the scholarship. While I understand that you are looking forward to hear the response from the university, although since you have the deadline Its important for you to clear the payment within the deadline. 

For the offer letter, Let me share some insight with you that we are expecting the good news anytime soon.
