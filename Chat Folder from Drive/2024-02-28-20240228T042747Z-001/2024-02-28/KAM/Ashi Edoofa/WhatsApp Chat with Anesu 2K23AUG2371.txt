Edofa makes students more responsible and independent which is something that is expected for a person to be successful.This also creates future leaders because for one to be a leader he or she should be responsible and independent.Edofa is there to increase the capacity of a student's success by takings part in helping the student to reach greater heights.Edofa has very crucial expectations which it requires from the student so that the Edofa vision becomes effective.Students must follow all the Edofa instructions and should be open minded so that many doors are unlocked.

Edofa is like our parents because it makes very good choices for students by choosing very good institutions for its students.It very different from other agents who just want money from people.Edofa helps from the heart which makes it a very reliable program in shaping the future of its students.
26/1/24, 5:56 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your insights with me dear, Let me also add to each video that you watched and help you summarize a few additional insights:
26/1/24, 5:57 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 1: Important Message for Enrolled Students*

The first video underscores the importance of two crucial qualities: open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions. Edoofa's vision for its students is to foster success in their careers, and promote responsibility, and independence. A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.
26/1/24, 5:57 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s Vision for You*

Edoofa's vision for its students is to provide them with employment opportunities and the skills necessary to become future leaders. The program places students above other candidates by investing significant time and effort into finding reputable, education-focused institutions rather than solely business-oriented ones.
26/1/24, 5:57 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

In the third video, it is highlighted that Edoofa's founders have dedicated over a decade to meticulously identify reputable educational institutions. Students are advised to cultivate the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to excel in the job market. All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to student's career goals.
26/1/24, 5:57 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools. It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.
26/1/24, 5:57 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In summary, these videos emphasize the significance of qualities such as open-mindedness, following instructions, and cooperation. Edoofa's vision is to empower students for successful careers and leadership roles by carefully selecting educational institutions. The SOP is a vital tool for effective communication and admission success. 

I hope you agree with all of this and were able to understand these by watching the four videos?
26/1/24, 6:00 PM - +263 71 658 2805: I agree and I was able to understand
26/1/24, 6:01 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
26/1/24, 6:01 PM - +263 71 658 2805: Yes we are on the same page

27/1/24, 1:02 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright dear
27/1/24, 1:19 PM - +263 71 658 2805: <Media omitted>
27/1/24, 1:19 PM - +263 71 658 2805: Number 1
27/1/24, 1:21 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright dear
27/1/24, 1:25 PM - +263 71 658 2805: 2. Primary memory is the main or internal memory of a computer system whose characteristics are 
-it's the working and main memory of a computer
-computer can not function without it.
-it's faster than secondary memory
-it's highly volatile, can lose all saved data should power be switched off.
We can also  call it temporary memory or cache, unlike secondary memory, information saved in primary memory  is easily lost when power  supply of a computer is switched off,
Examples: EPROM, REGISTERS, CACHE, RAM.
*Secondary memory
- Is a storage device that can not be accessed by the CPU directly,  also called  external memory, it has the capacity to store larger volumes of data  permanently and are less epensive. The CPU can only access it by means of an input/output channel, data is transfered to primary from secondary memory before its assessed. A secondary memory device organises data into files and directories according to file systems which the owner may access by permission, a secondary memory device may keep primary data temporarily when primary memory gets full.
examples:
*optical storage devices eg CDs, DVDs, Blu ray disc's,
Magnetic storage devices eg zip floppy and hard drives
*Solid state storage devices eg USBs and memory sticks. <This message was edited>

27/1/24, 1:32 PM - +263 71 658 2805: 3.OSI is an abbreviation which stands for Open Systems Interconnection. Open Systems Interconnection model is a conceptual model that standardizes the communication between different computer systems.It  was developed by International Organization for Standardization. It has 7 layers which work collaboratively to transmit the data from one person to another across the globe.The 7 layers are physical, data link, network, transport, session, presentation and application layer.The physical layer provides a physical medium through which bits are transmitted. Data link layer is used for error free transfer of data frames.The network layer is responsible for moving the packets from source to the destination.Transport layer provides reliable message delivery from process to process. The session layer is used to establish,manage and terminate the sessions. We have the Presentation layer which is for translation, compressions encryption. Lastly, there is application layer which provide the services to the user. <This message was edited>

27/1/24, 1:44 PM - +263 71 658 2805: 4.Java does not support operator overloading. Operator overloading is a programing method where operators are implemented in user defined types with specific logic dependant on the types of given arguments.Operator overloading makes it easier to specify a user defined implementation for operations with one or both operands of a user defined class or structure.
Operator overloading is a feature in C++ that allows Operators such as +,-,* and/ to be redefined for user defined types.The behavior of these operators can be customized for objects of a class.For example the + operator can be overloaded to add two complex numbers.The syntaxes for overloading an operator is to define a function with the keyword operator followed by the operator symbol like operator +

Operator over loading is a feature in python that allows you to give extended meaning beyond their predefined operational meaning to operators.For example the + operator can be used to add two integers as well as join two strings and merge two lists.This is possible because the + operator is overloaded by the 'in-class and the 'str' class.To overload an operator, Python provides some special function or magic functions that automatically invoke when it is associated with that particular operator

27/1/24, 1:46 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for providing your response withus. With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey. we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*.
27/1/24, 1:47 PM - Ashi Edoofa: let us move forward with our discussion. To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is *B.Tech (Computer Science Engineering)* and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
27/1/24, 1:49 PM - +263 71 658 2805: Yes it is
27/1/24, 1:50 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
27/1/24, 1:50 PM - Ashi Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
27/1/24, 1:50 PM - Ashi Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses. <This message was edited>
27/1/24, 1:50 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
27/1/24, 1:51 PM - +263 71 658 2805: Yes
27/1/24, 1:52 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
27/1/24, 1:52 PM - Ashi Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $1000. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
27/1/24, 1:52 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
27/1/24, 1:54 PM - +263 71 658 2805: Correct
27/1/24, 1:55 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
27/1/24, 1:56 PM - +263 71 658 2805: Yea we are
27/1/24, 1:56 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

1. *Tuition Fee*: $1800 per annum
2. *Food and Accommodation Fee*: $1000 per annum 

*Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum*
27/1/24, 1:56 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Registration Fee to be paid: $1000 (deadline within two weeks of issue of the offer letter, part of the university’s first-year fee and will be adjusted against the first-year cost of education $2800). I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?
27/1/24, 1:58 PM - +263 71 658 2805: Yes I have
27/1/24, 1:59 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $1000, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $1000 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
27/1/24, 2:00 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $1000 = $1800. This amount can be paid in two installments of $900 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $900 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
27/1/24, 2:01 PM - +263 71 658 2805: Noted
27/1/24, 2:01 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
27/1/24, 2:02 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
27/1/24, 2:02 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
27/1/24, 2:03 PM - +263 71 658 2805: Noted
27/1/24, 2:04 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
27/1/24, 2:05 PM - +263 71 658 2805: No questions
27/1/24, 2:06 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright please, Now with this, we are done with step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
27/1/24, 2:06 PM - Ashi Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one.
27/1/24, 2:06 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
27/1/24, 2:06 PM - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
27/1/24, 2:09 PM - +263 71 658 2805: Very much excited
27/1/24, 2:10 PM - +27 78 792 0371: I may have a question on the visa and traveling any  idea, of the cost associated with these two portions air ticket from Zim to lndia and visa application
? Thank you
27/1/24, 2:13 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your queries with me, Let me share that the cost of the visa fees is $83. As for the flight tickets, the prices may vary based on the demand, but on average, they range from $450 to $550. I hope this information is helpful to you.
27/1/24, 2:13 PM - Ashi Edoofa: The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
27/1/24, 2:13 PM - Ashi Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received special news for the students of the 2024 admission intake. May I know if you are excited to know the news we have for you?
27/1/24, 2:15 PM - +263 71 658 2805: Yes I am excited
27/1/24, 2:15 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am happy to see that you are excited. After speaking with thousands of students and parents who completed their admission process before you, we realized that the current economic situation in African countries makes it a bit challenging for parents to pay the full registration fee at once. 

In response to the same challenge, we had a detailed discussion with the academic board and university official. As a result, we developed a solution to alleviate the financial burden of the parents specifically for the registration fee due of $500 to $1000.
27/1/24, 2:15 PM - Ashi Edoofa: We at Edoofa are thrilled about this development, and I believe it will significantly help all of our students and their families. Are you aware of the solution?
27/1/24, 2:19 PM - +27 78 792 0371: Very keen to hear the solution
27/1/24, 2:21 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That is alright, let me share the same. With respect to the conversation we had with the academic board and the university officials, we requested them to allow the students to make the payment of their registration fee in two parts within a span of 45 days thereby reducing the financial pressure.
27/1/24, 2:21 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Here's how it works: Consider that your registration fee is $1000. After you will receive the offer letter, the first part of the registration fees which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, i.e. $500 needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university (For most of the universities 15 days). Subsequently, the second part of $500, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
27/1/24, 2:21 PM - Ashi Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for January 29 , 2024, and your registration fee stands at $1000, you'll need to make a payment of $500 on or before January 29, 2024. The remaining $500 should be paid by February 29 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
27/1/24, 2:23 PM - +27 78 792 0371: Good news indeed for us parents 👏👏👏 <This message was edited>
27/1/24, 2:25 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Indeed, Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
27/1/24, 2:26 PM - +27 78 792 0371: So far so good, we reserve the right to keep coming back to you should we need further help <This message was edited>
27/1/24, 2:27 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Are you excited to initiate the process? For the current round of admissions, only 31 scholarship seats are available and hence let us begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the payment plan offered for the registration fee.

21/2/24, 4:04 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In order to ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion -

2) What's your accommodation/hostel fee per year, as mentioned in the letter?
3) What's your Miscellaneous and Uniform Fee (applicable for first year only) ?
4) What's your University Related and Examination fee [Per annum] ?
5) You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
21/2/24, 4:08 PM - +263 71 658 2805: Okay Ma'am let me do that
21/2/24, 4:09 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Sure dear
21/2/24, 4:15 PM - +27 78 792 0371: I regret failing to attend with Anesu  as was my plan, l should have met Ms Vilsha as well and discuss with her as a parent, we have actually become so much obsessed with the Edoofa program thus far, we feel obliged to say our expectations too, we may seize the same feeling and sense of belonging to not take the offer of the Quest institute while we wait for possible offers from the likes of LPU, Chandigarh or Galgotius
21/2/24, 4:15 PM - +263 71 658 2805: In order to ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion -

1) What’s your per annum tuition fee after the scholarship as mentioned in the letter? $1100
2) What's your accommodation/hostel fee per year, as mentioned in the letter?$700
3) What's your Miscellaneous and Uniform Fee (applicable for first year only) ? 
4) What's your University Related and Examination fee [Per annum] ?
5) You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?$1000
21/2/24, 4:16 PM - Ashi Edoofa: @27787920371 I will be assisting your doubts regarding the same, once I complete our discussion
21/2/24, 4:16 PM - +27 78 792 0371: Thank you
21/2/24, 4:18 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Your Miscellaneous and Uniform Fee is $100 and University Related and Examination fee  is $50
21/2/24, 4:18 PM - Ashi Edoofa: As you can see in your offer letter from the Quest Group of Institutions, after the scholarship your per annum tuition fee is $1100.
21/2/24, 4:19 PM - +263 71 658 2805: Thank you
21/2/24, 4:19 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Along with this, there is a $50 fee covering the university's regular examination fee, your library fee, and ERP Fee, along with other basic expenses such as the Wi-Fi facility. When you add this $50 to the per annum tuition fee of $1000, the total comes out to be $1050.
21/2/24, 4:19 PM - +263 71 658 2805: I get it now
21/2/24, 4:20 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Let me also brief you on the accommodation as well:  The on-campus accommodations at the Quest campus have different categories and the pricing for every room is different as mentioned in your offer letter.

Normal Seater
With Attached Washroom and Kitchen
21/2/24, 4:20 PM - Ashi Edoofa: If a student wishes to get a more affordable accommodation, they can stay off-campus as it is a lot cheaper and they get more freedom. The university officials will help you find off-campus accommodations and help you settle in after you report to the campus.
21/2/24, 4:20 PM - Ashi Edoofa: If you opt for accommodation outside the Campus, it would be comparatively cheaper, the cost will be around $600 per annum and that would include your food cost as well which means you would have to pay only $30 to $40 per month towards your living expenses making your per annum educational cost $1050  + $600 = $1650. I hope you are clear about this?
21/2/24, 4:23 PM - +263 71 658 2805: Yes its clear maam
21/2/24, 4:23 PM - +263 71 658 2805: Is there Transport?
21/2/24, 4:24 PM - Ashi Edoofa: The accommodations are situated near the university, and they are safe. Also, in terms of transportation costs, it is very convenient as it is very near to the university. It will be either walking distance or local transport for a quick and easy commute, which will not cost you more than $10 every month.
21/2/24, 4:25 PM - +263 71 658 2805: That's good
21/2/24, 4:27 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now that you know your per annum educational expenses for your education abroad, let me also help you understand how you can make your education more affordable. 

Ideally, the complete per annum fee is to be paid by the student, however, for students under the Edoofa Program, they have an additional opportunity of the EWYL Program. Because of that, you as a student can earn $800 to $1200 worth of scholarship credits in a year and use them to pay a part of your fee.
21/2/24, 4:27 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I would also like to inform you that the above range shared does not mean that a student can earn credits only up to $1200. There is no upper limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits. 

In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his or her higher education, he/she can earn accordingly. Are you clear on this?
21/2/24, 4:28 PM - +263 71 658 2805: Yes maam
21/2/24, 4:31 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, to understand how the EWYL Program helps you - Let us assume you earn scholarship credits worth $1000 in a year with the help of the EWYL Program.

Now with this, you can use the earned $1000 to pay a part of your per annum fee of $1650 (with the off-campus accommodation) and so the balance fee becomes $1650 - $1000 = $650 which will have to be paid by your parents/guardians at a stretch of one year.

With this, I believe you are able to see how you can make your education more affordable and reduce your family's financial pressure?
21/2/24, 4:32 PM - +263 71 658 2805: This is fantastic 😊
21/2/24, 4:33 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Moving ahead, as informed, the registration fee of $1000 mentioned in your offer letter will be adjusted against your first year's tuition fee, therefore the amount of tuition fee that you will be required to pay after you come to India will be $1650 - $1000 = $650. 

I hope you are clear about this as well?
21/2/24, 4:36 PM - +263 71 658 2805: Yes ma'am
21/2/24, 4:36 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright, please. Now, as per the offer letter, you are supposed to pay the registration fee of $1000 to reserve your scholarship seat with the university within 15 days.
21/2/24, 4:37 PM - +263 71 658 2805: Noted
21/2/24, 4:37 PM - Ashi Edoofa: But, with regards to our previous conversations, I am sure you recall that you have the privilege to make the payment of the same in two parts as below -

1. *$500 before 29th February, 2024.*
2. *$500 before 29th March, 2024.*
21/2/24, 4:37 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alternatively, if you are financially prepared, you can pay the complete fee of $1000 within 15 working days by *29th February 2024*. I hope you are clear with this and we are on the same page.
21/2/24, 4:37 PM - +263 71 658 2805: What if we are not really likely the institution...are we supposed to pay still
21/2/24, 4:38 PM - +263 71 658 2805: I do remember that
21/2/24, 4:39 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Let me address this query of yours by helping you understand how a student's university admission process is carried out.

I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Scholarship Program is a merit-based scholarship, and hence a student's application is shared with multiple universities that are recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board after considering a student's eligibility, along with the university's ranking and affordability.
21/2/24, 4:39 PM - Ashi Edoofa: After we share the application with the universities, it is on the admissions team of the university to accept or reject an application, and the decision to offer a scholarship depends on them. If you have any university on your mind, you can let me know and we will surely look into your inclinations as well.
21/2/24, 4:39 PM - Ashi Edoofa: As of now, your application has been only accepted by the Quest Group of Institutes and since we have shared your application with multiple universities, we are also hoping to receive updates from multiple universities. Once we get the same, we will surely inform you, but each university takes its own time to consider the application and so you have to be patient while the universities are evaluating the application. 

I hope you are clear about this now?
21/2/24, 4:40 PM - +263 71 658 2805: It's clear now
21/2/24, 4:52 PM - +263 71 658 2805: LPU or Galgotias
21/2/24, 4:52 PM - +263 71 658 2805: And Chandigarh
21/2/24, 4:56 PM - +27 78 792 0371: We appreciate ma'am  we are also very patient for responses that may come that may include our preferences. Please allow us to wait
21/2/24, 6:10 PM - Ashi Edoofa: At the same time, since it is an associated university with Edoofa, we have already shared your application with Lovely Professional University and Galgotias University for a scholarship application and we are currently waiting for an update from them.
21/2/24, 6:10 PM - Ashi Edoofa: As you know that each university takes its own time to evaluate an application, In that case, if you wish to wait for an update from let us say University A and end up missing the opportunity given by Quest, you would lose out on the scholarship from Quest and won't be able to join it in the future. 

To help you with that, there is a transfer option available to the students. Are you aware of that? <This message was edited>
21/2/24, 6:54 PM - +263 71 658 2805: I'm not aware.Would you tell me the transfer option
22/2/24, 8:01 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Morning @263716582805, I hope you find this message in good spirit!
22/2/24, 8:01 AM - +263 71 658 2805: Goodmorning Ms Ashi😊
22/2/24, 8:02 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Let me help you understand about the Transfer Option better -

Without any worries/concerns, you can go ahead and reserve your scholarship seat with Quest by paying your registration fee due. 

If and when in the future, you get a better scholarship offer and wish to change your university, in that case, you would have the opportunity to change your university without paying any additional amount of money.

If you do not get a better scholarship offer, in that case, you will be able to pursue your education at Quest without risking losing out on the scholarship.
22/2/24, 8:02 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Let me help you understand it with an example as well - 

Let us say you have paid $1000 to Quest to reserve your seat with the university and after that, you get a better offer from University A where your registration fee is again $1000.

If you wish to change your university to University A, in that case, one is to pay $1000, but because you would have already paid $1000 for Quest, the same amount would be adjusted against your fee of $1000 at University A and so you will not have to pay any other additional of money to reserve your scholarship seat with University or to change your university. 

I hope you are clear with this and have a better understanding?
22/2/24, 8:04 AM - +263 71 658 2805: I
22/2/24, 8:04 AM - +263 71 658 2805: Yes its clear ma'am
22/2/24, 8:06 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright, please. Now, let us come to the payment mode for your university registration fee due -

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
22/2/24, 8:06 AM - Ashi Edoofa: There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
22/2/24, 8:15 AM - +263 71 658 2805: I stay in Kwekwe
22/2/24, 8:17 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright please, If you are planning to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
22/2/24, 8:17 AM - Ashi Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
22/2/24, 8:17 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
22/2/24, 8:22 AM - +263 71 658 2805: Thank you
22/2/24, 8:25 AM - Ashi Edoofa: You are most welcome. Alternatively, I was also going through your application file and noticed that you made a deposit of your enrollment fee through Mama Money. 

If you want to use the same mode of payment for your university registration fee, you can do that as well since it would be feasible. If you want to use this method, please do let me know so that I will create the Mama Money order for you
22/2/24, 8:26 AM - +263 71 658 2805: I will let you know
22/2/24, 8:29 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, do you have any queries that you would like to ask ?
22/2/24, 9:08 AM - +263 71 658 2805: So far so good
22/2/24, 9:09 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright dear, When are you planning to make the payment for your registration fees ?
22/2/24, 9:13 AM - +263 71 658 2805: I will have to here from my parents first

23/2/24, 10:55 AM - +27 78 792 0371: Good morning, we have been following the discussions  about the Quest Offer that has come, as proud Edoofian parents  we  would like to  reject the Quest offer and patiently wait for other offers that may come. Thank you for explaining the transfer process  very well. Let's just wait for other offers that may come as long as you have shared Anesu's application across Edoofa accredited universities. Thank you
26/2/24, 9:53 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Anesu, How was your weekend ?

26/2/24, 10:17 AM - Ashi Edoofa: I am delighted to know that your weekend was well, I am well thank you. As you have shared that you want to reject the scholarship opportunity provided by the Quest Group of Institutions, May I kindly ask what are your thoughts behind the same ?
26/2/24, 11:09 AM - +27 78 792 0371: We have rejected the Quest offer after  comparing it with our preferred universities in India, LPU  and/Galgotius, in as much as it is a scholarship, it also must be of sound comparison, we are going to wait for other offers which we are sure they will come, we remain proud Edoofians and anticipate the best out of our Edoofian family membership, our most preferred university is LPU  followed by Galgotius
26/2/24, 11:14 AM - Ashi Edoofa: That is completely understandable @27787920371, We will try our best to give you offer letter from both of your preferred universities however you have the option to transfer your admission. By doing so, In case you didn't like to scholarship percentage given by another university you have the opportunity at Quest however if you did get the good scholarship at other university you will be able to transfer, right ?
26/2/24, 11:16 AM - +27 78 792 0371: Thank you so much Ms Ashi, we would not mind to do a transfer fro Galgotius to LPU, Chandigarh included <This message was edited>

26/2/24, 11:27 AM - +27 78 792 0371: I do understand you ma'am, we are trying to avoid the mishap of having to take what we do not want in the event of failing to get an offer, let's all know that there is no offer yet and stay prepared for good offers, ma'am this is a life changing matter for Anesu and we are better off doing the right things at once
26/2/24, 11:36 AM - Ashi Edoofa: As Anesu's admission officer, I am committed to ensuring that she has the best opportunities available to her. I understand that this is a turning point for her, and I want to help guide her towards success.

I strongly recommend that you take advantage of the current opportunity by making the payment for the registration process. This will allow Anesu to receive offer letters from both of her preferred universities, which will greatly increase her chances of success. I understand that you want to reject an offer from Quest, but I won't recommend you to do so.
26/2/24, 11:37 AM - Ashi Edoofa: For the clear understanding, when you will make the payment of first installment. We will move forward with Anesu's admission process, and submit her application to both LPU and Galgotias University. Within 3-4 days, we will receive an evaluation of her application and an offer letter from each university. At that point, you can choose which university to transfer the payment to.

I am here to help you every step of the way and answer any questions you may have. Please let me know if there is anything else I can do to assist you.
