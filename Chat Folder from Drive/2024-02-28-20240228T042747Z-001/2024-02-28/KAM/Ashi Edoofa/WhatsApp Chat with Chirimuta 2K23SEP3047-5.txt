18/12/23, 10:37 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Welcome @263783965838 <This message was edited>
19/12/23, 12:58 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Chirimuta,

In light of the offer letter you received, I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to you and your family on this remarkable achievement in your academic journey.

Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion for you and your family, and I can only imagine the excitement that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.
19/12/23, 12:59 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now that you have the letter in your possession, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you've had the chance to go through the offer letter thoroughly. 

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
19/12/23, 1:09 PM - +263 71 563 6867: We did go through the offer letter
19/12/23, 1:10 PM - +263 71 563 6867: Good afternoon sir
19/12/23, 1:10 PM - +263 71 563 6867: So the program fee, its 2450 per semester or yearly?
19/12/23, 1:18 PM - Ashi Edoofa: @263715636867 We will discussing the same in the discussion today, As we proceed with today's discussion, we will get into the details of this specific offer letter. I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.

The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
19/12/23, 1:23 PM - +263 71 563 6867: Ok sir  we can proceed
19/12/23, 1:27 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you have gone through your offer letter from Lovely Professional University, I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with any queries you have. For us to begin our conversation, I want you to look at the letter again and tell me the following so that I know you have read it well -

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission Processing Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4. What’s the Registration fee?
19/12/23, 1:32 PM - +263 71 563 6867: Its saying 1225 for the tuition fee
19/12/23, 1:36 PM - +263 71 563 6867: 2. Duration 4 years
3. Admission fee 200usd
4. Registration 700usd
19/12/23, 1:43 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Yes, that is correct. As you can see in your offer letter, your course is a 4-year-long course, and each year is divided into 2 semesters, this means that you will have 8 semesters in your degree.*

After the scholarship, your per semester tuition fee is $1225 making your per annum tuition fee ($1225*2) = $2450. Is that clear?
19/12/23, 1:44 PM - +263 71 563 6867: Without the hostel fee?
19/12/23, 1:47 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Yes @263715636867, Now, Let me also brief you on the two categories of accommodation that are available at LPU -

*1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels inside LPU have different categories. Standard Room with Air Cooler and Standard Room with Air Conditioner with a different number of seaters, the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want.

The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a standard four-seater air cooler room is $1125 and the per annum standard mess/food service fee is $550 and this increases with the type of room/meal plan you choose.
19/12/23, 1:47 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

We also have many students in India who have opted for accommodation outside the LPU campus considering it is more affordable, the cost will be around $1000 per annum and that includes Rent, Food, Wifi Service, and other basic amenities such as water and electricity bills.

The outside accommodations are safe. Students have an option to cook for themselves, along with that they find a community of Edoofians from Africa who are already studying at the same university as them.
19/12/23, 1:59 PM - +263 78 396 5838: So how much is one suppose to pay per semester
19/12/23, 2:02 PM - Ashi Edoofa: @263783965838 May I know for which accommodation are you asking for? <This message was edited>
19/12/23, 2:09 PM - +263 71 563 6867: l really wanted the university but the fees are high hence my parents won't afford
19/12/23, 2:14 PM - +263 71 563 6867: If there was an option for scholarship percentage increase or other better ones, it would be better
19/12/23, 2:17 PM - +263 78 396 5838: How is the 1225 per semester paid
19/12/23, 2:27 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I understand your concern dear, I would like to share that it is totally fine having these concerns. We understand that the cost of education at LPU University is not as per your expectations. Considering that LPU University is one of the best private universities in India that focuses more on branding and that is the reason they have good exposure for the students, however, it's a bit challenging for the parents to afford Higher Education at LPU.
19/12/23, 2:28 PM - Ashi Edoofa: @263783965838 I am not able to understand your query please elaborate
19/12/23, 2:33 PM - +263 71 563 6867: Its okay, but is there any hope again for other offer letters or am now restricted to Gulzar now
19/12/23, 2:34 PM - +263 71 563 6867: As in,  is the maximum number of offer letters 2 or l might receive other ones in future
19/12/23, 2:38 PM - Ashi Edoofa: No Dear, There is no maximum number of offer letter for Edoofians however we have only received these two offer letters for you. If we receive any other offer letter for you we will definitely share it with you. For now, Can we move ahead with the discussion for the offer letter from LPU?
19/12/23, 2:44 PM - +263 71 563 6867: Ok sir, we can proceed
19/12/23, 2:49 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright, If you decide to stay on campus, the university officials will help you settle and will be taking responsibility for your well-being, our per annum accommodation cost will be $1675.

However, if a student doesn’t wish to stay on campus and is looking for more affordable accommodation options, in that case, they can go with the off-campus accommodation where their per annum cost would be around $1000 including the food cost and they can also cook food for themselves.
19/12/23, 2:49 PM - Ashi Edoofa: For the off-campus accommodation, you can connect with any of the Edoofians staying off-campus, and they would help you look for the off-campus accommodation options. If you are not connected with any students, we will help you connect with them near your time of arrival so that they can help you with the off-campus accommodation options.

LPU never forces anyone to choose the Hostel, they ask them to visit the campus, check for themselves, and then decide whether he/she wants to stay inside or outside the campus. Are you clear on this?
19/12/23, 2:50 PM - +263 71 563 6867: Yes clear
19/12/23, 2:52 PM - Ashi Edoofa: You also have the examination fee of $75 which is due every semester, and the health insurance fee. A Medical Health Insurance policy is mandatory for all international students and they can get it from the university itself and it would cost them $50 per annum subject to yearly revision.

If God forbids and something happens to you during your higher education, you would be protected from the financial risks or uncertainties that arise due to a medical emergency. I hope you are clear about this?
19/12/23, 2:53 PM - +263 78 396 5838: Yes
19/12/23, 2:55 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $700 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on January 1st, 2024*. I hope we are together so far?
19/12/23, 2:55 PM - +263 78 396 5838: Yes
19/12/23, 3:01 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. With this, your registration fees would be $550. I hope you understand?
19/12/23, 3:02 PM - +263 78 396 5838: Yes understood
19/12/23, 3:05 PM - Ashi Edoofa: With this, Let me share a few insights into the university with you -
19/12/23, 3:06 PM - Ashi Edoofa: LPU is one of the best universities in India and it has been ranked in the top 80 universities worldwide, because of its international tie-ups, the exposure a student gets at the university is indomitable. 

It has a campus of 800 acres, with over 100,000 students studying from all over the world. Students from LPU are placed at Microsoft, Google, IMF, Work Bank, and many more. It has spent a lot of money building the infrastructure so that a quality service can be given to the students.
19/12/23, 3:06 PM - Ashi Edoofa: The students at LPU are not only looking for Academics but holistic development is given the utmost importance. The students there can join clubs to represent the University in various competitions like MUN, Debate, and Sports along with various other activities.

As you can not visit the campus and see it for yourself, in that case, you can take a virtual tour of the campus, it is open 24/7 and is never off. Here is the link for the same - https://www.lpu.in/virtual-tour/

19/12/23, 3:10 PM - +263 78 396 5838: Do they wear uniforms
19/12/23, 3:22 PM - Ashi Edoofa: @263783965838 There is no such guidelines for the uniform however in some course there is a requirement to wear the formals during lectures, however while you are in campus you can wear casual clothes
19/12/23, 3:38 PM - +263 78 396 5838: Thank you
19/12/23, 3:38 PM - +263 78 396 5838: And paying the 1225 is there a payment plan
19/12/23, 3:42 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Welcome @263783965838
19/12/23, 3:42 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Yes, You will be given a flexible payment plan so that you can make the payment without any inconvenience
19/12/23, 3:43 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, I would also encourage you to take some time and share your offer letter from LPU with your family, have a detailed discussion with them, and help them understand the letter better. 

I am sure they must be quite excited for you since you have been offered a scholarship by one of the top Indian universities and now you are one step closer to making your dream of education abroad a reality.

During your conversation, if you come up with any queries or any concerns, I would encourage you to note them down so that we can have a detailed discussion on them on Thursday at 04:00 PM and also discuss the way forward for your admission process.
19/12/23, 3:44 PM - +263 78 396 5838: Thank you sir will surely do
19/12/23, 3:44 PM - +263 78 396 5838: So off campus how do u get in touch with other Edoofians who learn at LPU
19/12/23, 3:50 PM - Ashi Edoofa: @263783965838 We will help you co-ordinate with them, moreover we have the DSW (Division of Student Welfare) team who will assist you further regarding off-campus accommodation.
19/12/23, 4:14 PM - +263 78 396 5838: Okay l understand
19/12/23, 4:22 PM - Ashi Edoofa: On that note, we will be bringing our today's conversation to a close. Wish you a blessed week ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.
19/12/23, 4:22 PM - +263 78 396 5838: Thank you same to you sir

Once the payment is verified, we will update your scholarship application accordingly. Additionally, we will notify the university authorities about the payment for their records to ensure a smooth visa process.
27/12/23, 10:56 AM - +263 77 407 4930: Hello sir

27/12/23, 6:03 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In reference to our discussion, I'd like to inquire if you are currently available to engage with us to move ahead with our discussion?
27/12/23, 6:11 PM - +263 77 407 4930: Yes sir am available
27/12/23, 6:11 PM - +263 77 407 4930: How are you
27/12/23, 6:19 PM - +263 77 407 4930: This is Chirimuta, l am available
27/12/23, 6:20 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am fine, thank you.
27/12/23, 6:21 PM - +263 77 407 4930: Great to hear that
27/12/23, 6:23 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to know that you are available for the discussion @263774074930.
27/12/23, 6:24 PM - +263 77 407 4930: Ok sir
27/12/23, 6:26 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In regard to your concern, I would like to share that it is totally fine having these concerns. We understand that the cost of education at LPU University is not as per your expectations. Considering that LPU University is one of the best private universities in India that focuses more on branding and that is the reason they have good exposure for the students, however, it's a bit challenging for the parents to afford Higher Education at LPU.
27/12/23, 6:34 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Also, As you are looking forward to receive an offer letter from Galgotias University, I would like to share that Chirimuta's application is already in process with Galgotias University, however considering that the Galgotias University is also a private university the cost of education is expected to be similar to that of LPU. Since, you were looking forward for the same, I took an initiative to provide you with an estimate, the total cost of education at Galgotias University is anticipated to be around $2800-$3000. In order to assist you further, May I know if you are aware of the education system in India ?
27/12/23, 6:41 PM - +263 77 407 4930: No am not aware of many things
27/12/23, 6:42 PM - +263 77 407 4930: Does it offer only 50% too
27/12/23, 6:42 PM - +263 77 407 4930: So which is a list of other better university which are reasonably cheap
27/12/23, 6:45 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Surely. I understand your concern as a parent here. Let me help you with the Education System of India. There are two types of Universities as shared below -
27/12/23, 6:45 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 1. Public Universities - Since Public University receives funding from the government, they are more affordable and are given more credibility when compared to private universities to be admitted there, students have to sit for a National Level Entrance Exam and there are no scholarships offered, apart from that, there is no provision for international students to take admitted over there.
27/12/23, 6:45 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 2. Private Universities - When we talk about Private Universities, International students can easily be admitted over there on a scholarship, they would pursue their education at the university and would be registered there, however since these are private universities, the fee structures are a little higher when compared to public universities. I hope you are clear with the difference first?
27/12/23, 6:46 PM - +263 77 407 4930: Yes it's clear
27/12/23, 6:46 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Hence, there are multiple institutes and colleges affiliated with those universities, and students can enroll in those institutes, the degree which they get is directly from the public university they are affiliated with and has the institute's name written on it. Basically, the students study at an institute/college but are registered with the university.
27/12/23, 6:49 PM - +263 77 407 4930: Ok clear sir
27/12/23, 6:49 PM - +263 77 407 4930: We can proceed
27/12/23, 6:49 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I would like to know what are your thoughts here @263774074930 ?
27/12/23, 6:50 PM - +263 77 407 4930: What's the maximum scholarship percentage can one attain at Galgotias and other universities
27/12/23, 6:52 PM - Ashi Edoofa: @263774074930 The scholarship percentage is totally depends on the student's application please, however as I have mentioned that the estimated cost of education after scholarship will be around $2800-$3000 per annum.
27/12/23, 6:54 PM - +263 77 407 4930: The cost is after deducting how much percentage
27/12/23, 7:01 PM - Ashi Edoofa: As per the updated we have received from the officials, they are looking forward to provide 50% scholarship for Chirimuta
27/12/23, 7:02 PM - +263 77 407 4930: Ok fine
27/12/23, 7:03 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright @263774074930, May I know if there is anything else you would like to ask?
27/12/23, 7:04 PM - +263 78 396 5838: Yes what is the process of changing the university let's say form gulzar to LPU
27/12/23, 7:05 PM - +263 77 274 6079: Hello guys how are you I hope you are all doing fine
27/12/23, 7:05 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your query @263783965838, If you decide to change your university from Gulzar to LPU, we will be proceeding with the same procedure.
27/12/23, 7:06 PM - +263 77 274 6079: Do you have a rough Idea on the cost of visa application
27/12/23, 7:06 PM - +263 78 396 5838: Which procedure??
27/12/23, 7:10 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am fine thank you, Let me share that the cost for Visa Application is $83 which will be paid to the Embassy.
27/12/23, 7:48 PM - +263 77 407 4930: Ok noted sir
27/12/23, 11:18 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Greetings, kindly excuse me for not connecting with you earlier. I was occupied with a meeting which was then accompanied by my dinner break, I would love to move ahead with the discussion, however, since it is past our available hours let us reconnect tomorrow at 06:00 pm. I hope you will be available so that we can have a discussion have a great night ahead.
28/12/23, 9:13 AM - +263 78 396 5838: Good morning sir
28/12/23, 9:15 AM - +263 78 396 5838: L have a question let's say we want to proceed with LPU and the registration fee after the deduction of 150 usd it remains 550 usd but with gulzar it was 600 so what happens to the remaining balance of 50 usd
28/12/23, 6:02 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Chirimuta. Wishing you a good day!
28/12/23, 6:02 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In reference to our discussion yesterday, I'd like to inquire if you are currently available to engage with us to move ahead with our discussion?
28/12/23, 6:06 PM - +263 77 407 4930: Hello sir yes am available
28/12/23, 6:08 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to know that @263774074930, I would like to address the query shared earlier about the registration fees. If you are looking forward to continue with LPU in that case we will update the university and shift Chirimuta's admission to LPU and for the remaining amount of $50  that will be adjusted in your tuition fees.
28/12/23, 6:10 PM - +263 77 407 4930: Ok sir, we would like to proceed with LPU
28/12/23, 6:11 PM - +263 77 407 4930: But in the LPU offer letter, they stated that l have to submit my final A level results this December but unfortunately I can't since they are released mid January
28/12/23, 6:16 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know @263774074930, Regarding this please don't worry as your documents are already submitted for your A level document which is Statement of entry.
28/12/23, 6:16 PM - +263 77 407 4930: Ok thank you sir
28/12/23, 6:17 PM - +263 77 407 4930: So the whole 600 will be deducted from the tuition fee
28/12/23, 6:18 PM - Ashi Edoofa: You are welcome @263774074930, Yes the paid amount will be adjusted in first year tuition fees
28/12/23, 6:18 PM - +263 77 407 4930: Ok sir, so what procedure should we follow
28/12/23, 6:19 PM - Ashi Edoofa: @263774074930 As you have shared your decision with us, we will now proceed with the same and shift the Chirimuta's application to LPU. Now, you will receive the Acceptance Letter from LPU. I hope that's clear?
28/12/23, 6:20 PM - +263 77 407 4930: Sir can l have a sight of how the accomodations will look alike for off-campus accomodation
28/12/23, 6:20 PM - +263 77 407 4930: Okay this is after how long
28/12/23, 6:21 PM - +263 77 407 4930: Even images if possible
28/12/23, 6:24 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Sure @263774074930, I will look forward if we can assist you with the picture for off-campus accommodation. Although, I want to share that before Chirimuta's arrival, our DSW (Division of Student Welfare) team will connect with you to assist you with the best affordable accommodation.
28/12/23, 6:25 PM - Ashi Edoofa: We will share an update with you once we receive the Acceptance Letter from the university officials.

28/12/23, 6:29 PM - +263 77 407 4930: I also wanted to ask if it's possible to make a flexible payment plan for the tuition fees at lpu
28/12/23, 6:32 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Sure @263774074930, There's an option for students to pay the tuition fees balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
28/12/23, 6:33 PM - +263 77 407 4930: Ok thank you
28/12/23, 6:34 PM - Ashi Edoofa: You are most welcome @263774074930

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?
16/1/24, 4:33 PM - +263 78 396 5838: <Media omitted>

5/2/24, 1:08 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Most welcome @263772746079
6/2/24, 4:18 PM - +263 78 396 5838: Good afternoon sir
6/2/24, 4:18 PM - +263 78 396 5838: L have a question to ask
6/2/24, 5:59 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Evening @263783965838 How are you doing?
6/2/24, 5:59 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Please go ahead with your query
6/2/24, 6:03 PM - +263 78 396 5838: Okay let's say we are not pleased with all the offer letters been given to us what will be the next step
6/2/24, 6:19 PM - Ashi Edoofa: May I know why you are thinking in that way please ?
6/2/24, 6:22 PM - +263 78 396 5838: Because its like 2 months without getting an offer letters and we are worried
6/2/24, 6:26 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I truly understand your thoughts here, Let me help you understand why you have not received the offer letter. I am sure you must be aware that the A Level & O Level results in Zimbabwe are out, and the students are eager for the offer letters. 

However, you need to understand that, just like you, there are over a thousand students who are part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program, and evaluating the results is a significant part of their admission journey. Hence, it is important for the team to evaluate the results with patience and then chart the next course of action.
6/2/24, 6:27 PM - Ashi Edoofa: With this we will be able to proceed your application at multiple university as promised, Moreover the university are also processing the same. I hope this has assisted your query, right ?
6/2/24, 6:32 PM - +263 78 396 5838: Is they a chance of an increase in the scholarship percentage
6/2/24, 6:36 PM - Ashi Edoofa: We want Chirimuta to have the highest percentage of Scholarship. Through Edoofa a student interacts with multiple Universities during their University Interaction Stage which is Step 5 of the Edoofa Cycle as well. 

Now it is obvious that every university would evaluate a student's application differently which means, after the University interaction, when the student receives multiple offer letters stating the exact quantum of scholarship from the universities, the student and the family members are given full liberty to choose a University based on the Quantum of scholarship they have provided to the student itself. This way the parents and the student gets to choose the most affordable higher education as per their own financial plans.
6/2/24, 6:37 PM - +263 77 407 4930: Suppose we don't receive other offer letters, or an increase in scholarship percentage as we expect and with the look of our finances maybe we will not be able to afford..will there be a refund of that 600 USD registration we paid
6/2/24, 6:37 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Greetings @263774074930!
6/2/24, 6:39 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Let me help you understand the procedure here as you are aware that the registration fees you have paid is for the reservation of your scholarship seat at the university. While I understand that you are having financial constraints. I would like to understand what challenge are you having ?
6/2/24, 6:39 PM - +263 77 407 4930: Greetings how are you
6/2/24, 6:39 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am fine thank you for asking.
6/2/24, 6:41 PM - +263 77 407 4930: Like what l said maybe we keep on receiving 50% scholarships and you have done all your best and we then see that we won't be able to meet other costs as expected, will that fee be refunded
6/2/24, 6:43 PM - Ashi Edoofa: @263774074930 I hope you are already aware that the cost of education shared by us falls under the offer letters we shared. I am a bit concerned here why are you mentioning that you will not be able to meet the other costs ?
6/2/24, 6:45 PM - +263 78 396 5838: Things are not as good and Chirimuta is not the only child we need to also take care of some of his siblings
6/2/24, 6:45 PM - +263 78 396 5838: So we asking is the more refundable?
6/2/24, 6:46 PM - +263 77 407 4930: And on another note, l recently lost my job so the finances are not that well
6/2/24, 6:52 PM - +263 77 407 4930: So his father is the one who is supporting the whole family
6/2/24, 6:55 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I understand where your concerns coming from, The challenges you are facing are truly understanding please. I comeplety understand that you have responsibilties as a parents. Although, I am sure you are indeed want your child to have a best education so that he can ace in his career.
6/2/24, 6:56 PM - Ashi Edoofa: As you have mentioned above that you are looking for the higher scholarship percentage, I would like to share that when it comes to the scholarship percentage, it varies from university to university, but I sincerely hope that you will be able to secure the best scholarship opportunity.
6/2/24, 6:56 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Regarding the registration fees, I want to emphasize that they are used to reserve your seat at the university. Since the university has already reserved a seat for you, a refund would not be possible in this case. I am more than willing to assist you, and I also want to understand your situation better, especially considering your decision of giving up on Chirimuta's educational plans.
6/2/24, 6:57 PM - +263 77 407 4930: Is there any reservation of a seat since we haven't received an acceptance letter
6/2/24, 6:58 PM - +263 77 407 4930: From any particular university showing that we have reserved a seat there
6/2/24, 6:59 PM - +263 77 407 4930: So does it mean if we want to withdraw due to financial crisis there won't be any refund
6/2/24, 7:01 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Please note that you have not received the acceptance letter as you have not finalized the university looking at the more scholarship opportunities. However, Since you have completed the registration procedure you have indeed reserved your seat at the LPU University and  Gulzar Group of Institute.
6/2/24, 7:02 PM - +263 77 407 4930: We are not giving up but our query is on that you said if he produce  favorable results at the end, the scholarship percentage will increase, we pushed him to do so and he produced best results..we are hoping for a higher percentage and also as to reduce the financial burden as things are not good for us
6/2/24, 7:02 PM - +263 77 407 4930: Looking with the Zimbabwe economy, the costs will be relatively high than what we earn
6/2/24, 7:03 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Please don't worry as Chirimuta is one of the dedicated student, I as his Admission officer wants the best opportunity and indeed looking forward to give him the best opportunity so that he can pursue his dreams.
6/2/24, 7:08 PM - +263 77 407 4930: So if we don't get a positive result at the end, that fee is non refundable?
6/2/24, 7:10 PM - Ashi Edoofa: @263774074930 I am afraid that the refund is not possible as previously mentioned, However May I know how is the EWYL program going on for you ?
6/2/24, 7:15 PM - +263 77 407 4930: You never mentioned about it
6/2/24, 7:16 PM - Ashi Edoofa: @263774074930 I believe you are already connected with your mentor right ?
