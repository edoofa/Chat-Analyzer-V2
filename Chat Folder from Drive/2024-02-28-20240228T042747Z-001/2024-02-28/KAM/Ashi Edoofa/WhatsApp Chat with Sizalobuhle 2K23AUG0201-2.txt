27/12/23, 6:20 PM - +263 77 562 0930: Would like to have a recap
27/12/23, 6:39 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Sure @263775620930, Could you please let me know the specific point of which you would like to have a recap?
27/12/23, 6:44 PM - +263 77 562 0930: About the payments mam
27/12/23, 6:53 PM - +263 77 562 0930: Of course, it will be reduced to zero, dear. It is a part of your first year's tuition fee. Allow me to explain further so that you will have a better understanding. The University Registration Fee, ranging from $500 to $750, constitutes a component of your total university tuition fees. This fee is necessary to secure your seat at the university and is required to be paid before the start of your session while you are at your home, by the student/parent/guardian. It's important to understand that this amount is not an additional charge, it will be subtracted from your first year's tuition fees. I hope we are on the same page here? I still have this detailed information.
27/12/23, 6:57 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Yes @263775620930, I would love to assist you here and help you understand the payments please.
27/12/23, 6:57 PM - +263 77 562 0930: Yes thank you
27/12/23, 6:59 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Once we are done with today's session, we will move ahead with your application with multiple universities. Once they will share an offer letter with us, we will update you and then you will be required to pay the registration amount which is $750 to reserve your scholarship seat however as this is not an additional expense this fees will be reduced from your first year's tuition fees.
27/12/23, 6:59 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I hope you understand?
27/12/23, 7:03 PM - +263 77 562 0930: Yes but isn't said it depends with the university
27/12/23, 7:04 PM - Ashi Edoofa: @263775620930 Kindly elaborate please
27/12/23, 7:11 PM - +263 77 562 0930: It was said admission fee it will depend on the university which accepted your application form so that means the costs are not the same in all universities, if am not mistaken
27/12/23, 7:12 PM - +263 77 562 0930: Please help for more information
27/12/23, 7:13 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Correct @263775620930. The registration fees varies from University to university, although the range for the registration fees is shared with you which is $500 to $750.
27/12/23, 7:19 PM - +263 77 562 0930: Yes mam thank you
27/12/23, 7:22 PM - Ashi Edoofa: You are welcome @263775620930, May I know if you have any other doubt?
27/12/23, 8:33 PM - +263 77 562 0930: No mam l truly understand
27/12/23, 8:40 PM - Ashi Edoofa: So, are you excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month.

27/12/23, 9:21 PM - +263 77 562 0930: Please will resume tomorrow

I am pleased to inform you that your application has been accepted by one of the leading universities, *LPU University* in India, and they have decided to offer you a scholarship.

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
17/1/24, 2:04 PM - +263 78 865 2403: Thanks for asking l am doing well , l highly excited for hearing such great news from you
17/1/24, 2:05 PM - +263 78 865 2403: Yes l did
17/1/24, 2:06 PM - +263 77 562 0930: Good afternoon
17/1/24, 2:09 PM - +27 84 941 8738: Good  afternoon  all,
17/1/24, 2:34 PM - +27 84 941 8738: My network problem
17/1/24, 2:48 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright please, As we proceed with today's discussion, we will get into the details of this specific offer letter. I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.
17/1/24, 2:48 PM - Ashi Edoofa: The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
17/1/24, 3:00 PM - +263 78 865 2403: To read carefully and understand  needs of the offer letter, as mainly part of it have noticed the procedures that guide understanding of the entire admission progress . By following all the steps from the beginning likes of accuracy when having discussions, meeting deadlines till you secure the scholarship offer.
17/1/24, 3:11 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from LPU University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
17/1/24, 3:11 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion -

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission Processing Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4. What’s the Registration fee?
17/1/24, 3:20 PM - +263 78 865 2403: Okay well noted

1.Tuition fee per semester the scholarship - $1225
2.It is written 4 years (8 semesters)
3.Admission Processing Fee -$200
4.Registration Fee - $700
17/1/24, 3:22 PM - +27 84 941 8738: Yes thank u
17/1/24, 3:32 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Yes, that is correct. As you can see in your offer letter, your course is a 4-year-long course, and each year is divided into 2 semesters, this means that you will have 8 semesters in your degree.*

After the scholarship, your per semester tuition fee is $1225 making your per annum tuition fee ($1225*2) = $2450. Is that clear?
17/1/24, 3:35 PM - +263 77 562 0930: <Media omitted>
17/1/24, 3:43 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your query dear, Let me share that the duration of your course is 4 years as mentioned earlier by your counselor. In the above enrollment letter, It might be a technical error.
17/1/24, 3:43 PM - +263 78 865 2403: Okay now understood thank you
17/1/24, 3:53 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, Let me also brief you on the two categories of accommodation that are available at LPU -
17/1/24, 3:53 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels inside LPU have different categories. Standard Room with Air Cooler and Standard Room with Air Conditioner with a different number of seaters, the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want.

The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a standard four-seater air cooler room is $1125 and the per annum standard mess/food service fee is $550 and this increases with the type of room/meal plan you choose.
17/1/24, 3:53 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

We also have many students in India who have opted for accommodation outside the LPU campus considering it is more affordable, the cost will be around $1000 per annum and that includes Rent, Food, Wifi Service, and other basic amenities such as water and electricity bills.

The outside accommodations are safe. Students have an option to cook for themselves, along with that they find a community of Edoofians from Africa who are already studying at the same university as them.
17/1/24, 3:56 PM - +263 78 865 2403: So isn't that food and accommodation and food are for free ,or isn't that tuition fee includes everything
17/1/24, 4:05 PM - Ashi Edoofa: No please, The cost of Accommodation and tuition fees are different. If you decide to stay on campus, the university officials will help you settle and will be taking responsibility for your well-being, our per annum accommodation cost will be $1675.

However, if a student doesn’t wish to stay on campus and is looking for more affordable accommodation options, in that case, they can go with the off-campus accommodation where their per annum cost would be around $1000 including the food cost and they can also cook food for themselves.
17/1/24, 4:05 PM - Ashi Edoofa: For the off-campus accommodation, you can connect with any of the Edoofians staying off-campus, and he/she would help you look for the off-campus accommodation options. If you are not connected with any students, we will help you connect with them near your time of arrival so that they can help you with the off-campus accommodation options.

LPU never forces anyone to choose the Hostel, they ask them to visit the campus, check for themselves, and then decide whether he/she wants to stay inside or outside the campus. Are you clear on this?
17/1/24, 4:12 PM - +263 78 865 2403: Understood Sir but l am still worried that since for me to get enrolled under this scholarship , it took a long struggle for my parents to get that money so how am l gonna be able to pay that fee or is there any other way to assist me with that ☺️
17/1/24, 4:25 PM - +27 84 941 8738: Ummmm now on this it's tough,isn't that Idoffa schoolarship is a sponsor
17/1/24, 4:27 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I understand your thoughts about the same, I would love to assist you here. In order for the same, May I kindly know the fees range shared with you by us for your Education ?
17/1/24, 4:33 PM - +263 78 865 2403: Thank you mam.
The cost of education after the Edoofa scholarship is $2000-3000 per annum including tuition fee, food and accommodation.
17/1/24, 4:40 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to know that you remember the same. As you can see that the scholarship offered by the LPU University is exclusive. I would be assisting you regarding the same soon. For now, Can we continue with the session ?
17/1/24, 4:41 PM - +263 78 865 2403: Noted mam
17/1/24, 4:43 PM - Ashi Edoofa: You also have the examination fee of $75 which is due every semester, and the health insurance fee. A Medical Health Insurance policy is mandatory for all international students and they can get it from the university itself and it would cost them $50 per annum subject to yearly revision.

If God forbids and something happens to you during your higher education, you would be protected from the financial risks or uncertainties that arise due to a medical emergency. I hope you are clear about this?
17/1/24, 4:45 PM - +263 78 865 2403: Yes l understand
17/1/24, 4:47 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $700 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on  January 30th, 2024*. I hope we are together so far?
17/1/24, 4:48 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $100 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
17/1/24, 4:56 PM - +263 78 865 2403: Yes mam but as a family we were aware that University Admission Fee has to be paid within 30days or before if we are mistaken
17/1/24, 4:57 PM - +263 78 865 2403: Yes mam please
17/1/24, 4:57 PM - +27 84 941 8738: Yes
17/1/24, 4:58 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $100 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $600 of the registration fee. This $600 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$300 before the first deadline date of January 30th, 2024* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$300 before the second deadline date of February 29th, 2024* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
17/1/24, 4:58 PM - Ashi Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $600 within 15 working days, before January 30th, 2024. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
17/1/24, 5:03 PM - +263 78 865 2403: Okay thank you mam now l understand
17/1/24, 5:08 PM - +263 78 865 2403: Well noted
17/1/24, 6:24 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
17/1/24, 6:24 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
17/1/24, 6:26 PM - +263 78 865 2403: I am in Bulawayo
17/1/24, 6:28 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
17/1/24, 6:28 PM - Ashi Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
17/1/24, 6:28 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
17/1/24, 6:34 PM - +263 78 865 2403: Okay Mam so how much is the rate when exchanging from our $ currency to your own
17/1/24, 6:35 PM - Ashi Edoofa: @263788652403 As mentioned above that the transfer rate is 7%, I hope you have understood it.
17/1/24, 6:35 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
17/1/24, 6:36 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Shorwi’s FBC Bank for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
17/1/24, 6:41 PM - +263 77 562 0930: Okay
17/1/24, 6:41 PM - +263 77 562 0930: Well noted
17/1/24, 6:43 PM - Ashi Edoofa: @263775620930 Have you taken a note of this message ?
17/1/24, 6:46 PM - +263 77 562 0930: Yes Mam but it will costs $675 including transfer charges so uhmm am not sure if l will manage to make it , then am trying to check and balance if l use that other mode of exchange of currency
17/1/24, 6:48 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I understand dear, In that case you can pay the fees through Mr. Rajan. Now that you know your per annum educational expenses for your education abroad, let me also help you understand how you can make your education more affordable.

Ideally, the complete per annum fee is to be paid by the student, however, for students under the Edoofa Program, they have an additional opportunity of the EWYL Program. Because of that, you as a student can earn $800 to $1200 worth of scholarship credits in a year and use them to pay a part of your fee.
17/1/24, 6:48 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I would also like to inform you that the above range shared does not mean that a student can earn credits only up to $1200. There is no upper limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits.

In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his or her higher education, he/she can earn accordingly. Are you clear on this?
17/1/24, 6:49 PM - +263 77 562 0930: Yes mam thank you
17/1/24, 6:51 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, do you have any queries that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?

17/1/24, 7:01 PM - +263 78 865 2403: Okay thank you
17/1/24, 7:09 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Let me also share a few insights into the university with you -
17/1/24, 7:09 PM - Ashi Edoofa: LPU is one of the best universities in India and it has been ranked in the top 80 universities worldwide, because of its international tie-ups, the exposure a student gets at the university is indomitable. 

It has a campus of 800 acres, with over 100,000 students studying from all over the world. Students from LPU are placed at Microsoft, Google, IMF, Work Bank, and many more. It has spent a lot of money building the infrastructure so that a quality service can be given to the students.
17/1/24, 7:09 PM - Ashi Edoofa: The students at LPU are not only looking for Academics but holistic development is given the utmost importance. The students there can join clubs to represent the University in various competitions like MUN, Debate, and Sports along with various other activities.

As you can not visit the campus and see it for yourself, in that case, you can take a virtual tour of the campus, it is open 24/7 and is never off. Here is the link for the same - https://www.lpu.in/virtual-tour/

I trust this message finds you well and in high spirits. As I was organizing my day today, I took the opportunity to review your scholarship application file. I observed that the remaining amount of $321 for your university registration fee is due by *29th February, 2024*. Consequently, I wanted to reach out to inquire about your preparations.

How is your preparation going forward? Have you been able to raise the outstanding amount of $321 by now?
27/2/24, 6:23 PM - +263 78 865 2403: Thank you Admission Officer , we are doing well ,yes we are still on the progress with the outstanding balance yet for now we managed to get $200 but please may you allow us to pay few days after due date like on the first week of March so that I can organize the amount , would like to apologize for delaying payments.
