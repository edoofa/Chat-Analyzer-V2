16/1/24, 11:08 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Emmanuel,

I trust this message finds you well, and I hope you are in high spirits. In recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their A-Level results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey.
16/1/24, 11:08 AM - Kirti Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?

22/1/24, 12:23 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Good Day Emmanuel , 
*I am Mr Sahil, Senior Career Counsellor at Edoofa*

If you remember well, I hosted the counselling and evaluation sessions for you through the Edoofa Scholarship Program from which you have made me proud by qualifying for the program.

22/1/24, 12:23 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
22/1/24, 12:23 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Recalling our counseling and evaluation sessions, I take pride in your qualification for our esteemed Edoofa Scholarship Program. Recently, the A-level results from all my students have brought immense joy. Your name, in particular, caught my attention, and I was going through your Admissions Group and was shocked to see that you weren't able to complete the University registration process being a bright student and I still remember your passion for career and goals, making you one of my favourite students.  I personally had a discussion with the Admissions Head and have decided to help you in the best possible way as I understand your calibre.  May I know, what exactly happened due to which you weren't able to proceed and what are your plans as of now?
22/1/24, 1:20 PM - +263 71 895 9334: My uncle can't make the payment
22/1/24, 1:20 PM - +263 71 895 9334: He says it's expensive and he's the only one who pays my fees
22/1/24, 1:47 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Is it the duration/timeline of registration fees that is bothering him or he concerned the amount ?
22/1/24, 1:56 PM - +263 71 895 9334: I think the amount
23/1/24, 9:08 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Good morning!
I trust you're doing well.
Could you share the financial budget your uncle has planned for your higher education abroad? I'm sure he must have devised a monthly budget for your education.
23/1/24, 10:47 AM - +263 71 895 9334: Ok ok
23/1/24, 12:44 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Did you understand my question ?
23/1/24, 1:34 PM - +263 71 895 9334: Mmmmm not really
23/1/24, 2:41 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Can you share the monthly budget that your uncle has set for your tertiary education ?
23/1/24, 9:35 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: let's schedule our discussion for tomorrow at 9 AM CAT. If you face challenges or need a different time, let me know in this group. Success often comes from open communication about concerns.

24/1/24, 8:13 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: I see you have gone through my messages earlier but did not respond back, *please If there is something that is concerning you because of which you are not Proceeding ahead with your process, then I would request you to come forward and address the same with me here in the group so that I can provide you with a solution to cater to your issues and guide you with your admissions procedures.*

6/2/24, 11:23 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: I am fine thank you
6/2/24, 11:24 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: @263773414960 
I've personally engaged in discussions regarding Emmanuel's application with the Director of the Academic Board, aiming to secure the maximum scholarship. Typically, the Director may have limited time, but in response to my specific request, he has agreed to allocate time for this matter. However, your active participation is crucial. By making efforts from your end, I can then effectively advocate for your application to be considered for a higher percentage of scholarship.
6/2/24, 1:18 PM - +263 77 341 4960: How are you mr Sahil.
On the previous offer we got we did calculations and it seems to be more expensive for us even after the 50% scholarship
6/2/24, 1:51 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: What led you to choose not to pursue a degree in Law, Business Administration, or Commerce, which typically offer more employment opportunities?
6/2/24, 1:53 PM - +263 71 895 9334: Because I'm not good with it
6/2/24, 1:53 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: That's the purpose of my presence here. As mentioned before, I'm not part of the admission team; rather, I represent the academic board. My aim is to assist in securing additional scholarship for your child through my approval. However, facilitating a 90-100% scholarship requires mutual effort. Since you are the beneficiary, active participation and cooperation from your end are essential.
6/2/24, 1:55 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Have you considered exploring courses in Business Management or Commerce? From my perspective, aligning your aspirations and career goals suggests that these fields could be more suitable for you.
6/2/24, 1:56 PM - +263 71 895 9334: Mmmmm noo sir
I'm not good with maths
I'm good with languages and those other Alevel subjects
6/2/24, 2:38 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: I understand but Business administration and Law don't includes maths .
