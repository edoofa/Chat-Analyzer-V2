I trust this message finds you in good health. As we step into the second week of January, I wanted to reach out and share an exciting milestone that India as a country achieved within the first week of 2024 - the successful India's Chandrayaan-3 Engine Test.
12/1/24, 5:53 PM - Kirti Edoofa: This accomplishment is responsible for the third lunar mission, aiming to land a rover on the Moon's south polar region and conduct scientific studies that could check Moon's viability to sustain life. It signifies a significant scientific advancement, laying the groundwork for future progress.
12/1/24, 5:53 PM - Kirti Edoofa: This achievement has not only pushed boundaries but also inspired young minds all over the world to pursue their dreams. On the same note, I wanted to extend my heartiest wishes for the New Year to you and your family and check in to see how you and your family started your year?
16/1/24, 12:20 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Proud Edoofians,

I trust this message finds you well, and I hope you are in high spirits. In recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their A-Level results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey.

*I am Mr Sahil, Senior Career Counsellor at Edoofa*

22/1/24, 1:06 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
22/1/24, 1:06 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Recalling our counseling and evaluation sessions, I take pride in your qualification for our esteemed Edoofa Scholarship Program. Recently, the A-level results from all my students have brought immense joy. Your name, in particular, caught my attention, and I was going through your Admissions Group and was shocked to see that you weren't able to complete the University registration process being a bright student and I still remember your passion for career and goals, making you one of my favourite students.  I personally had a discussion with the Admissions Head and have decided to help you in the best possible way as I understand your calibre.  May I know, what exactly happened due to which you weren't able to proceed and what are your plans as of now?
23/1/24, 9:31 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: let's schedule our discussion for tomorrow at 9 AM CAT. If you face challenges or need a different time, let me know in this group. Success often comes from open communication about concerns.
23/1/24, 9:42 PM - +263 77 245 8180: It's ok
24/1/24, 9:46 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Good Morning Everyone, 

*“Education is the passport to the future, for tomorrow belongs to those who prepare for it today.” —Malcolm X"*

*When you step into this day realize that you have immense opportunities! All you need to do is give your best to grab it.*

With all positive energy, I am here to continue our interactive session.
24/1/24, 9:46 AM - +263 77 245 8180: Good morning. I you are quite fine today. I'm Bukamboni's father. The university application process which was supposed to be done after August was no done because Bukamboni had gone back to school for his final term at school. This was after the Statement of Purpose form was filled and sent to you. You actually acknowledged receipt of the completed SOP form
24/1/24, 10:26 AM - +263 78 665 9518: Okay
24/1/24, 10:26 AM - +263 78 665 9518: Ok it was really great
24/1/24, 10:31 AM - +263 78 665 9518: Good morning
24/1/24, 12:21 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: I've noticed a slower pace in the admission process, and it seems there might be delays on your end due to exams. However, other students who reserved seats have already secured spots. I'm here to expedite the process for you, given my limited time. Your commitment to remaining active is crucial, as I'll be dedicating my personal time to assist you.
Confirm As per records : Have you selected Btech in Civil Engineering, planning to arrive in India by August 2024?
24/1/24, 12:24 PM - +263 77 245 8180: Yes please
24/1/24, 12:29 PM - +263 78 665 9518: Yes I selected Btech in Civil Engineering
24/1/24, 12:33 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: As I have promised, the Edoofa Admissions team will be submitting your application to multiple universities that will evaluate your application and upon being eligible, you receive the offer letters with comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. *I will guide you to the best education institution/university associated with us that aligns with your vision and interest and would provide you with a conducive environment for your holistic development and to fulfil your career goals.*

Upon receiving the Offer Letter, you will have a few weeks to pay a portion of your university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. We discussed the registration fee during our counselling sessions. May I know, what do you recall about the same now?
24/1/24, 12:39 PM - +263 77 245 8180: The registration fee, for Edoofians, is part of the first year tuition fee and it's around $500
24/1/24, 12:44 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Let me help you with a better understanding. *Usually, the registration fee is an additional fee apart from the cost of education but Edoofians receive an exclusive benefit where it is a part of the cost of education itself.* Let me give you an example:-
24/1/24, 12:44 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: As we discussed in the counselling session, the cost of education in India ranges from $6000-$8000 per annum which is reduced to $2000-$3000 per annum through the Edoofa Scholarship Program which includes the registration fee, remaining tuition fees, Accommodation, Food, Wifi, Laundry, library fee etc. Now, let us assume,

1. *Tuition Fee*: $1800 per annum
2. *Food and Accommodation Fee*: $1000 per annum 
Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum
3. *Registration Fee to be paid:* $1000
24/1/24, 12:44 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: This means this registration fee that you pay will be subtracted from the cost of education ($2800-$1000= $1800) and the remaining fee of $1800 can be paid in two installments. The first part of $900 within 3 days after your arrival here in India and the remaining $900 will be due in December 2024, or before your second semester begins.

*Do you have any questions for me regarding the same?*
24/1/24, 1:03 PM - +263 78 665 9518: Yes understood
24/1/24, 1:04 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: The registration fee can be paid either in two equal parts(The first half within 15 days and the second half within 30 days) or in one go itself.

Are you clear with the details?
24/1/24, 1:08 PM - +263 78 665 9518: Yes its clear
24/1/24, 1:10 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Alright please, Now with this, we are done with step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
24/1/24, 1:10 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one.
24/1/24, 1:10 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
24/1/24, 1:10 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
24/1/24, 1:11 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received special news for the students of the 2024 admission intake. May I know if you are excited to know the news we have for you?
24/1/24, 1:14 PM - +263 78 665 9518: Yes I'm very excited
24/1/24, 1:16 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: I am happy to see that you are excited. After speaking with thousands of students and parents who completed their admission process before you, we realized that the current economic situation in African countries makes it a bit challenging for parents to pay the full registration fee at once. 

In response to the same challenge, we had a detailed discussion with the academic board and university official. As a result, we developed a solution to alleviate the financial burden of the parents specifically for the registration fee due of $500 to $1000. 

We at Edoofa are thrilled about this development, and I believe it will significantly help all of our students and their families. Are you aware of the solution?
24/1/24, 1:21 PM - +263 78 665 9518: No I am not
24/1/24, 1:23 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: let me share the same. With respect to the conversation we had with the academic board and the university officials, we requested them to allow the students to make the payment of their registration fee in two parts within a span of 45 days thereby reducing the financial pressure.

Here's how it works: Consider that your registration fee is $1000. After you will receive the offer letter, the first part of the registration fees which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, i.e. $500 needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university (For most of the universities 15 days). Subsequently, the second part of $500, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
24/1/24, 1:23 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: For instance, if your deadline is set for January 25, 2024, and your registration fee stands at $1000, you'll need to make a payment of $500 on or before January 25, 2024. The remaining $500 should be paid by February 25 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
24/1/24, 1:29 PM - +263 78 665 9518: Yes I have followed and understood the time frame given
24/1/24, 2:46 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education? <This message was edited>
24/1/24, 2:50 PM - +263 78 665 9518: Everything looks clear
24/1/24, 2:59 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Are you excited to initiate the process? For the current round of admissions, only 31 scholarship seats are available and hence let us begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the payment plan offered for the registration fee. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
24/1/24, 3:09 PM - +263 78 665 9518: Yes I'm very excited
24/1/24, 3:10 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Great to know
24/1/24, 3:10 PM - +263 78 665 9518: Yes please
24/1/24, 3:21 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: I want you to share the following documents with us as they are required for your university application preparation:

*1. A-Level Result/Letter of Recommendation/Statement of Entry (A-Level).*

*2. O-Level Results*

*3. Identity proof (International Traveling Passport or National ID or Birth Certificate)*

25/1/24, 9:09 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Duly noted
25/1/24, 9:10 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: With this, we can proceed to step 4 of the admission cycle, i.e., Offer Letter from University/College. The universities will take three to five days to evaluate your application, after which, if they accept your application for a scholarship, they will send you a scholarship offer letter. In the offer letter, the scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee will be mentioned.

On this note ,I will reach out to you once we get an update from the universities. Wish you a blessed day ahead, and please extend our regards to your family as well.

20/2/24, 10:48 AM - +263 78 665 9518: I'm very sorry for my absence in Harare due to transport costs as I'm located in Binga, a marginal place on the map of Zimbabwe. I will therefore be available online or on a phone call.

21/2/24, 1:03 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: In light of the offer letter you received, I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to you and your family on this remarkable achievement in your academic journey. May I kindly know if you have gone through the offer letter ?
21/2/24, 1:06 PM - +263 78 665 9518: Yes thank you and I have gone through the latter
21/2/24, 2:52 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Now, as per your offer letter, after the scholarship, your per annum tuition fee is $1000. Additionally, there is a $100 fee that covers the university's regular examination fee, uniform fee, library fee, ERP fee, and other basic expenses such as the Wi-Fi facility. When you add this $100 to the per annum tuition fee of $1000, the total comes out to be $1100.
21/2/24, 2:52 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Furthermore, being a student under the Edoofa Program, you can make your education more affordable. Through the EWYL Program, you have the opportunity to earn $800 to $1200 worth of scholarship credits per year. These credits can be used to reduce your fees.

Importantly, there is no upper limit to the scholarship credits you can earn. Your hard work and dedication in financing your higher education will determine your potential earnings.
21/2/24, 2:52 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Now, that you have all the details and the costs for your higher education at Quest Group of Institutions, you can let me know if you wish to secure your scholarship seat there and I will help you with that.
21/2/24, 2:52 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: With this, I would like to share some University insights with you, Shall I proceed ?
21/2/24, 2:57 PM - +263 78 665 9518: Yes please
21/2/24, 2:57 PM - +263 78 665 9518: Yes you can proceed
21/2/24, 3:13 PM - +263 78 665 9518: So since there are two semesters per annum, how is the $1100 paid....? Is it paid in two parts that is $550 first semester and the other $550 in the second semester......?
22/2/24, 9:48 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Yes please you also have an option to raise the amount in monthly installments .
22/2/24, 9:49 AM - +263 78 665 9518: Ok ok
22/2/24, 9:50 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Let me also tell you a bit about the Quest Group of institutions. It is the most ideal destination for international students interested in studying in India. They have more than 200 International students from more than 15 different countries in Africa and Southeast Asia.
						
It has a Unique Mentorship program to encourage students to do well according to their abilities and strengths and has been awarded Outstanding Technical Institution of North India during the World Education Summit and Awards.
22/2/24, 9:50 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Quest Group of Institutions is approved by the All India Council of Technical Education (AICTE), the statutory body for Technical Education under the Ministry of HRD, Govt. of India. It is affiliated with IKG Punjab Technical University, which is a Govt. University ranked amongst the top public universities in India.

22/2/24, 9:53 AM - +263 78 665 9518: Yeah thus really a nice place indeed
22/2/24, 10:42 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Now, I would also encourage you to take some time and share your offer letter with your family, have a detailed discussion with them, and help them understand the letter better. 

I am sure they must be quite excited for you since you have been offered a scholarship by an Indian university and now you are one step closer to making your dream of education abroad a reality.

During your conversation, if you come up with any queries or any concerns, I would encourage you to note them down so that we can have a detailed discussion on them and also discuss the way forward for your admission process.
22/2/24, 10:59 AM - +263 78 665 9518: Yes I have already shared it with my family and we discussed it.
22/2/24, 11:13 AM - +263 78 665 9518: Taking note of the accommodation, what is the difference between living in the campus and off campus, comparing the two in terms of standards of living and the costs.
22/2/24, 12:26 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Let me also brief you on the accommodation as well:  The on-campus accommodations at the Quest campus have different categories and the pricing for every room is different as mentioned in your offer letter.


Normal Seater
With Attached Washroom and Kitchen
22/2/24, 12:26 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: If a student wishes to get a more affordable accommodation, they can stay off-campus as it is a lot cheaper and they get more freedom. The university officials will help you find off-campus accommodations and help you settle in after you report to the campus.
22/2/24, 12:26 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: If you opt for accommodation outside the Campus, it would be comparatively cheaper, the cost will be around $600 per annum and that would include your food cost as well which means you would have to pay only $30 to $40 per month towards your living expenses making your per annum educational cost $1100  + $600 = $1700. I hope you are clear about this?
22/2/24, 1:15 PM - +263 78 665 9518: Yes please thank you very much
26/2/24, 8:46 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Good morning
How are you doing today?
26/2/24, 8:46 AM - +263 78 665 9518: Good morning I'm doing very well
26/2/24, 9:04 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Now that you know your per annum educational expenses for your education abroad, let me also help you understand how you can make your education more affordable.
Ideally, the complete per annum fee is to be paid by the student, however, for students under the Edoofa Program, they have an additional opportunity of the EWYL Program. Because of that, you as a student can earn $800 to $1200 worth of scholarship credits in a year and use them to pay a part of your fee.
26/2/24, 9:05 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: I would also like to inform you that the above range shared does not mean that a student can earn credits only up to $1200. There is no upper limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits.
26/2/24, 9:05 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his or her higher education, he/she can earn accordingly. Are you clear on this?
26/2/24, 9:08 AM - +263 78 665 9518: Yes I'm very much clear and aware of the EWYL program
26/2/24, 9:10 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Now, to understand how the EWYL Program helps you - Let us assume you earn scholarship credits worth $1000 in a year with the help of the EWYL Program.


Now with this, you can use the earned $1000 to pay a part of your per annum fee of $2287 (with the off-campus accommodation) and so the balance fee becomes $2287 - $1000 = $1287 which will have to be paid by your parents/guardians at a stretch of one year.


With this, I believe you are able to see how you can make your education more affordable and reduce your family's financial pressure?
26/2/24, 9:12 AM - +263 78 665 9518: Yes
26/2/24, 9:17 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Moving ahead, as informed, the registration fee of $1000 mentioned in your offer letter will be adjusted against your first year's tuition fee, therefore the amount of tuition fee that you will be required to pay after you come to India will be $1100 - 1000 = $100.


I hope you are clear about this as well?
26/2/24, 9:19 AM - +263 78 665 9518: Ok so its $1000 + tuition $100 making it $1100 per annum
26/2/24, 9:22 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Its would be 1000 per year .
26/2/24, 9:24 AM - +263 78 665 9518: Ok so you mean $100 is only for the first year
26/2/24, 9:27 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Miscellaneous & Uniform charges USD 100 payable extra in 1st Year (One Time).
26/2/24, 9:29 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Alright, please. Now, as per the offer letter, you are supposed to pay the registration fee of $1000 to reserve your scholarship seat with the university within 15 days.
26/2/24, 9:30 AM - +263 78 665 9518: Ok I understand now thank you
26/2/24, 9:31 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: But, with regards to our previous conversations, I am sure you recall that you have the privilege to make the payment of the same in two parts as below -


1. *$500 before 29th Feb 2024.*

2. *$500 before 15 th  March 2024 .*
26/2/24, 9:31 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Alternatively, if you are financially prepared, you can pay the complete fee of $1000 within 15 working days by **29th Feb 2024**. I hope you are clear with this and we are on the same page.
26/2/24, 9:31 AM - +263 78 665 9518: Yes please
26/2/24, 9:32 AM - +263 78 665 9518: Yes I'm clear
26/2/24, 9:33 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Alright, please. Now, let us come to the payment mode for your university registration fee due 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account. <This message was edited>
26/2/24, 9:33 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
26/2/24, 9:34 AM - +263 78 665 9518: No not in Harare, but In Binga, Mat North province

27/2/24, 2:59 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Okay
27/2/24, 3:01 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
27/2/24, 3:01 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
27/2/24, 3:01 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
27/2/24, 3:01 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr.Charles Jerera ’s FBC Bank for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference <This message was edited>
27/2/24, 3:01 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Let me do the same. If making the payment through Mr.Charles is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -
