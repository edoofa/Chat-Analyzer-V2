16/1/24, 9:46 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Bothwell,

I trust this message finds you well. I am *Ms. Kirti, the Admission Officer at Edoofa*. I would like to inform you that Mr. Shivjeet will no longer be available, as he is advancing in his career with a new opportunity. While his departure is a loss for us, we are also filled with pride and joy for his future endeavors. Moving forward, I will be handling the next steps in your university admission journey and will be directing you in the right direction.
16/1/24, 9:47 AM - Kirti Edoofa: As we step into the second week of January, I wanted to reach out and share an exciting milestone that India as a country achieved within the first week of 2024 - the successful India's Chandrayaan-3 Engine Test. This accomplishment is responsible for the third lunar mission, aiming to land a rover on the Moon's south polar region and conduct scientific studies that could check Moon's viability to sustain life. It signifies a significant scientific advancement, laying the groundwork for future progress.
16/1/24, 9:47 AM - Kirti Edoofa: This achievement has not only pushed boundaries but also inspired young minds all over the world to pursue their dreams. On the same note, I wanted to extend my heartiest wishes for the New Year to you and your family and check in to see how you and your family started your year?
16/1/24, 2:06 PM - +263 77 650 4403: We as a family are okay
16/1/24, 8:00 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. With great excitement and pride, I also want to share that over the past few days, the Edoofa team has been immersed in an exciting event we had in store for our students. Edoofa hosted a conference - the Symposium of Leaders, Innovators, and Creators at Edoofa, also known as 'SLICE-CON.'
16/1/24, 8:00 PM - Kirti Edoofa: The conference was attended by all the Edoofians of 2023 and a few senior Edoofians from previous batches. It focused on the art of creation, innovation, and, most importantly, the mindset required to make an impact in one's career.
16/1/24, 8:00 PM - Kirti Edoofa: During this Industrial Visit and the conference - SLICE CON, Corporate leaders, such as the CEOs and Co-founders from renowned companies like Rage Coffee, Sirona Hygiene, Jolin New York, and more, shared their insights and experiences. These individuals are at the helm of multi-millionaire brands, leading large marketing teams. Their presence added immense value, providing students with the opportunity to engage in transformative conversations.
16/1/24, 8:00 PM - Kirti Edoofa: We believe that interactions with such industry leaders can bring significant transformations to students' lives, enhancing their business acumen. Our Edoofians maximized this opportunity, having life-changing conversations with these influential figures. The main objective of the event was to emphasize the importance of thinking outside the box, and encouraging students to believe in themselves and their dreams. Before we discuss your admission journey further, I wanted to share a glimpse of the event, and I hope you are excited to attend similar events when you come to India.

16/1/24, 8:03 PM - +263 77 650 4403: Okay
16/1/24, 8:04 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Over the past couple of days, we also had the pleasure of conversing with some of our students who expressed their joy upon receiving their A-Level results.

Reflecting on my own school days, I vividly recall the mix of excitement and anticipation surrounding the result day. It is an important moment that shapes the path of one’s academic journey.
16/1/24, 8:04 PM - Kirti Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?
16/1/24, 8:05 PM - +263 77 650 4403: <Media omitted>
16/1/24, 8:06 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your results, and congratulations on successfully clearing all your A-Level subjects! Your hard work over the past few months has truly paid off.

I am sure your family is immensely proud of your achievements. Your A-level results have been duly noted, and we will quickly add them to your scholarship application. This will enable us to engage in discussions with the academic board and chart the best course of action for your next steps.
16/1/24, 8:06 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Kindly allow me time till Monday to thoroughly evaluate your results and plan the way forward. Once I have evaluated your results, along with all the other applications for your university admission, we will reconnect with you to discuss the next steps in your academic journey.
16/1/24, 8:07 PM - +263 77 650 4403: I have a question
17/1/24, 11:04 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, I hope you are doing well. 

Kindly excuse me for not connecting with you yesterday as I was occupied with some urgent work that required my immediate attention. However, we can connect now and please I would love to assist you with your query?
17/1/24, 12:43 PM - +263 77 650 4403: I could not meet up with the last deadline of that $750 which was needed so is the process of me going to India still on without me meeting that previous deadline
17/1/24, 12:49 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Yes please @263776504403 the opportunity is still open even though you missed your previous deadline.
17/1/24, 12:51 PM - +263 77 650 4403: So what if in the future l struggle to find that lot of money required?
17/1/24, 12:52 PM - +263 77 650 4403: Do universities in India offer programs like Biomedical Engineering and what are the subjects required
17/1/24, 12:57 PM - Kirti Edoofa: May I know why you think so, since you are aware of the cost so I am sure you will prepare for the same beforehand?
17/1/24, 12:58 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Yes please, they do however, I would like to understand why do you wish to know about the same since your course chosen is Ba. in Geography?
17/1/24, 12:59 PM - +263 77 650 4403: So basing with my results will the Scholarship percentage increase from 50%
17/1/24, 1:00 PM - +263 77 650 4403: I wanted to change my course if my subjects allow me to do biomedical engineering
17/1/24, 1:25 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @263776504403 This is something I will not be able to answer right now because one university has already offered you a scholarship and re-evaluation of results will take time since the results are out now we are also having a influx of larger number of application who are now willing to secure their scholarship, still you have the upper hand because your application was processed with the Endowment plan.
17/1/24, 1:26 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am sorry that will not be possible because the course that you wish to change requires subjects in the science field and the subjects you completed your A level do not align with the eligibility for Biomedical.
17/1/24, 1:28 PM - +263 77 650 4403: What is endowment plan
17/1/24, 1:28 PM - +263 77 650 4403: Ok
17/1/24, 1:56 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @263776504403 I am a little concerned here, I believe Mr. Shivjeet has had a discussion with you regarding the Endowment benefits, may I know if you recall that ideally the university registration fee for Galgotias is $750 but after the discussion with Mr. Shivjeet your application was processed under the Endowment program due to which you were only asked to pay $600 towards your registration giving you an endowment grant of $150 towards your application, may I know if you recall this discussion?
17/1/24, 2:02 PM - +263 77 650 4403: Yea
17/1/24, 2:04 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In that case, I am sure your question above is now answered?
17/1/24, 2:05 PM - +263 77 650 4403: Yes
22/1/24, 12:21 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Good Day Bothwell, 
*I am Mr Sahil, Senior Career Counsellor at Edoofa*

If you remember well, I hosted the counselling and evaluation sessions for you through the Edoofa Scholarship Program from which you have made me proud by qualifying for the program.
22/1/24, 12:21 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
22/1/24, 12:21 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
22/1/24, 12:22 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Recalling our counseling and evaluation sessions, I take pride in your qualification for our esteemed Edoofa Scholarship Program. Recently, the A-level results from all my students have brought immense joy. Your name, in particular, caught my attention, and I was going through your Admissions Group and was shocked to see that you weren't able to complete the University registration process being a bright student and I still remember your passion for career and goals, making you one of my favourite students.  I personally had a discussion with the Admissions Head and have decided to help you in the best possible way as I understand your calibre.  May I know, what exactly happened due to which you weren't able to proceed and what are your plans as of now?
22/1/24, 6:19 PM - +263 77 650 4403: As my father was unwell for now l don't have money to proceed with my studies as most of the money catered for the hospital bills
22/1/24, 6:20 PM - +263 77 650 4403: And l have changed my mind on the program l want to do so l don't know if you can help
23/1/24, 11:12 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: How is your father now ?
23/1/24, 11:18 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Can you please elaborate so that I personally can help you?
23/1/24, 12:05 PM - +263 77 650 4403: He is a little bit better now though there are some reviews which needs to be done as he was operated
23/1/24, 12:07 PM - +263 77 650 4403: I mean to say that my mother no longer want me to do BA in Geography but Bachelor of Health Services Management something like that
23/1/24, 1:02 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: We pray for his speedy recovery .
23/1/24, 1:03 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Could you kindly share the motivation behind your choice of studying this course, and what are your aspirations for yourself once you complete it? <This message was edited>
23/1/24, 1:03 PM - +263 77 650 4403: Thank you so much
23/1/24, 1:06 PM - +263 77 650 4403: Since childhood l wished to work at a hospital so me doing this course l will be able to take care of all the procurements and sales at the hospital and I will be able to make sure that all the medicine needed is available for each and every patient at the hospital
23/1/24, 1:40 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Thank you for sharing your aspirations! It's admirable that you have a goal of contributing to healthcare through hospital procurement and management. Given your interest in the medical field, may I inquire why you did not study Biology in A-level, as it's essential subject for medical-related courses?
23/1/24, 1:43 PM - +263 77 650 4403: I didn't study biology at A level as l came late for my a level at my previous school and the biology class was full
23/1/24, 1:46 PM - +263 77 650 4403: That is why l only want to do something with deals with the administration of the hospital activities
23/1/24, 3:51 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Certainly, it's crucial to recognize that each course has specific criteria set by the government, and these criteria remain consistent for all students. If a student doesn't meet these criteria, they are not be eligible to pursue that particular course, as these criteria are standardized and not subject to change for individual students. 

Given your expressed interest in administration, I would recommend considering a course in Business Administration. Would you like more detailed information and guidance on this particular course?
23/1/24, 9:35 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: let's schedule our discussion for tomorrow at 9 AM CAT. If you face challenges or need a different time, let me know in this group. Success often comes from open communication about concerns.
23/1/24, 9:51 PM - +263 77 650 4403: Okay
24/1/24, 7:22 AM - +263 77 650 4403: Truly speaking we might be continuing with this discussion but as of now l cannot see any progress  as there is not even a cent to proceed the educational journey in my family
24/1/24, 9:46 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Good Morning Everyone, 

*“Education is the passport to the future, for tomorrow belongs to those who prepare for it today.” —Malcolm X"*

24/1/24, 8:13 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: I see you have gone through my messages earlier but did not respond back, *please If there is something that is concerning you because of which you are not Proceeding ahead with your process, then I would request you to come forward and address the same with me here in the group so that I can provide you with a solution to cater to your issues and guide you with your admissions procedures.*

29/1/24, 10:18 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Good Morning Everyone, 
I personally noticed challenges in your admission process, so I'm here to help. Despite not being part of the admission team, as a member of the academic bench, I'll personally ensure your application is completed within three days, securing the maximum scholarship percentage possible .This will make your education more affordable than studying locally and open up maximum employment prospects. Trust me to handle everything, and let's start fresh for a successful outcome. As a dedicated effort, I'm providing you with the option to call me directly if there are any delays in the process.
29/1/24, 11:18 AM - +263 77 650 4403: OK sir
29/1/24, 12:30 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Do you know we at EDOOFA received 2000 Applications in a Single Day just a week before and each day since then we are receiving not less than 1000 Applications each day from students seeking Scholarship? We were overwhelmed and had to reject more applications because of limited seats, however were surely intrigued to know the reasons for such an immediate upsurge.  Having Conversations with my other students who are already preparing to arrive in India under the Edoofa Scholarship shared some mind-boggling Screenshots from the Fee Prospectus of the Universities in Zimbabwe.

29/1/24, 12:30 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: I am shocked to compile these data for Fee Structures of some famous Public Universities of Zimbabwe.

Bindura University of Science Education (BUSE) -https://www.buse.ac.zw/fees-structure/ - ($680 per term)

Chinhoyi University of Technology (CUT) https://www.cut.ac.zw/welcome/assets/files/fees-structure/School%20of%20Engineering%20Science.pdf - ($535 per term)

NUST -($870 per term)

I'm sure you and your family have discussed this thoroughly. What decisions have you made for your future? Considering the cost and employment opportunities, have you compared the benefits of studying in India with the Edoofa program against other options?
29/1/24, 4:41 PM - +263 77 650 4403: So can you share with me some of the course that l can do with Geography and Crop Science
29/1/24, 7:57 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
29/1/24, 7:57 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Yes
30/1/24, 7:26 AM - +263 77 650 4403: Share a list please
30/1/24, 8:45 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: *Good morning Everyone!*  let's draw inspiration from the timeless wisdom found in the Bible:

*"As the scriptures teach, knowledge is a steadfast companion. A person enlightened by wisdom is held in high regard across all realms. The brilliance of education surpasses the allure of beauty and the vigor of youth."*

 With positive energy, let's continue our interactive session and embrace the transformative power of education. So shall we begin ?
30/1/24, 8:45 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Ba is Geography

30/1/24, 9:21 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: BA travel and Tourism .
30/1/24, 9:23 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: BA ECONOMICS 
BA IN PSYCHOLOGY 
BACHELOR BUSINESS ADMISTRATION
LAW
BACHELOR IN COMMERCE
30/1/24, 9:24 AM - +263 77 650 4403: <Media omitted>
30/1/24, 9:24 AM - +263 77 650 4403: That is under the department of health and medicine
30/1/24, 10:28 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: This is for 2022 please cutoff
30/1/24, 11:00 AM - +263 77 650 4403: They say 13 cutoff but they require on 2 passes how come
30/1/24, 12:43 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: student should have more than 13 points and should be pass in atleast 2 subjects.
30/1/24, 12:43 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: This year cutoff is even high
30/1/24, 12:44 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: So which one is suitable for you ?
30/1/24, 12:47 PM - +263 77 650 4403: For now l can say none of the above because my mother didn't talk about anything on the list
30/1/24, 12:48 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Okay
30/1/24, 12:48 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Thats means $600*2 semester $1200 per year for tution fees $200 per year for internship 

$70 a month rent * 12 months = $840 a year for accommodation

Basic 3 meal sadza a day $1 per meal *3 meals a day *365 days = $1095 

Data bundles - $ 50 a month right * 12 months = $600 

Misc- $300 

Total at UZ = Exceeds $4100

Have you calculated this ?

Where as at Edoofa at top universities abroad you are only paying $2000-$3000 also complementary you are getting EWYL program to self finance the fees so which one is affordable ?
30/1/24, 12:50 PM - +263 77 650 4403: For now l can say all of the above isn't affordable for me at this point
30/1/24, 12:51 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: So what have you planned , will you sit home and stop studying ?
30/1/24, 12:54 PM - +263 77 650 4403: Do you know that on that $2000-$3000 price that you offer if we add transport costs to India,passport fee and Visa they will all add up to around 1.200 which will add to that $3000 becoming $4200
30/1/24, 12:55 PM - +263 77 650 4403: No l will not sit l will find somewhere affordable at low prices
30/1/24, 1:27 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Visa cost is $89 and we have students has got flights for $400 .
30/1/24, 1:29 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: and here I have not calculated transportation if I add transportation it will exceed $5000 to study in Zimbabwe as internationally you only travel once where as locally you have to travel daily and daily travel costs more I hope you understand that ?
30/1/24, 1:35 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: I have already provided you with links to universities where the local costs are significantly higher than studying abroad. It's important to note that the quality of education in Zimbabwe cannot be compared to that abroad, as employment numbers serve as a clear indicator. Let's consider the broader perspective as average salary in Zimbabwe is $1000-3000 where as in its $6000-9000
30/1/24, 7:11 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>

1/2/24, 8:48 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Good morning!
I trust you are doing well. I've observed that my messages have been read but not responded to. In moments of silence, I'm reminded of Psalm 37:7 (NIV): "Be still before the Lord and wait patiently for him." Is everything alright?
2/2/24, 9:13 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: *Good Morning Everyone*

*I hope you're well.

Thank you, and I look forward to your response.
2/2/24, 10:31 AM - +263 77 650 4403: I told you my problem and l don't think there is something else to explain
2/2/24, 1:36 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Have you discussed these calculations , It's crucial to walk through the numbers. If you considers the long-term perspective, you'll realize that the fees he'll be paying for you to study in Zimbabwe may surpass the costs associated with your course in India. Additionally, employment opportunities are limited in Zimbabwe, Even for top university in Zimbabwe like UZ graduates who often find themselves selling SIM cards on the streets or working at gas stations due to the education quality and job scarcity. There's also the uncertainty of completing the course on time, given the history of students facing delays due to riots or political influences. When you calculate the potential additional costs for these extra years, the total expense of completing a degree in Zimbabwe could be three times more than studying in India.
3/2/24, 8:11 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Good morning
How are you doing today?
5/2/24, 9:12 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Good morning! let's draw inspiration from the timeless wisdom found in the Bible:

Seize the opportunity to break free from limitations. Keep in mind Philippians 4:13 (NIV), "I can do all this through him who gives me strength." Let education empower your child!*

Over the past few days, we've been trying to connect with you to discuss your child's academic journey. We understand the financial commitments involved in providing quality education for your child.
