29/12/23, 3:39 PM - +27 67 910 5734: I'm ready
29/12/23, 4:06 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that here you go!

*Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
29/12/23, 4:07 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

6. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
29/12/23, 4:07 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.*
29/12/23, 4:09 PM - +27 67 910 5734: I'm done
29/12/23, 4:21 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
29/12/23, 4:21 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of your A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive your letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you would be able to apply for the student visa.
29/12/23, 4:21 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same.

This means you, as an Edoofa student, have the prestigious privilege of securing your seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioning yourself as a frontier person in this endeavor.
29/12/23, 4:24 PM - +27 67 910 5734: Noted
29/12/23, 4:27 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
29/12/23, 4:27 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
29/12/23, 4:27 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
29/12/23, 5:18 PM - +27 67 910 5734: yes
29/12/23, 5:55 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $100 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $650.
29/12/23, 5:55 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $650. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $100 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?

2/1/24, 6:23 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
2/1/24, 6:54 PM - +27 67 910 5734: Thank you so much have a blessed year too
2/1/24, 9:27 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I was not able to have a proper session with you to day as there were multiple calls with the university officials. As my available hours are coming to an end. I would like to let you know that I am now closing my session for today and let us proceed with the session tomorrow. Have a great night and my warm regards to your lovely family.
2/1/24, 9:33 PM - +27 67 910 5734: Same to  you sir
3/1/24, 10:57 AM - +27 67 910 5734: Greetings of the day
3/1/24, 2:39 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, dear parents and Magreth.

How are you doing this lovely afternoon?
3/1/24, 2:45 PM - +27 67 910 5734: We are doing good and you
3/1/24, 3:11 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am great thank you for asking. May I know if you are now ready to proceed with the session?
3/1/24, 3:13 PM - +27 67 910 5734: I'm ready
3/1/24, 3:31 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
3/1/24, 3:31 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $100 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
3/1/24, 3:31 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for December 30, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $650, you'll need to make a payment of $325 on or before December 30, 2023. The remaining $325 should be paid by January 30, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
4/1/24, 4:01 PM - +27 67 910 5734: Greeting
4/1/24, 5:48 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening!

I hope you are doing well and blessed. May I know if you are currently available to proceed with the session?
4/1/24, 9:20 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: As my available hours are coming to an end. I would like to let you know that I am now closing my session for today and let us proceed with the session tomorrow at 2:30 PM. Have a great night and my warm regards to your lovely family.
5/1/24, 5:52 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening!

I hope you are doing well today. I was not able to connect with you in a timely manner as I was on a call. How are you doing this lovely evening?
6/1/24, 3:58 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, Parents of Magreth,

This transition marks a significant chapter in my life as I will be bidding farewell to the cherished moments at the Admissions Team in Edoofa.

Over the past year, having the privilege of supporting numerous students, including you, in your pursuit of higher education has been truly rewarding. Witnessing our students thrive and excel in their dream universities and colleges has brought immense satisfaction.
6/1/24, 3:58 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: The decision to transition to a new phase in my life presents an incredible opportunity for me to continue contributing to the lives of students, ensuring their academic journey and overall experience remain enriched and fulfilling.

8/1/24, 2:01 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: In the past few days, I had an in-depth discussion with Mr. Shivjeet and had the opportunity to review your scholarship application file in our records. Through this process, I gained valuable insights into your dreams and aspirations to advance your academic career.

8/1/24, 2:01 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Before we get into the specifics of your admission journey and talk about your admission process, I would like to share an exciting milestone that India as a country achieved within the first week of 2024 – the successful *India's Chandrayaan-3 Engine Test.* This accomplishment is responsible for the third lunar mission, aiming to land a rover on the Moon's south polar region and conduct scientific studies that could check Moon's viability to sustain life. It signifies a significant scientific advancement, laying the groundwork for future progress.
8/1/24, 2:01 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This achievement has not only pushed boundaries but also has inspired young minds all over the world to pursue their dreams. On the same note, I wanted to extend my heartiest wishes for the New Year to you and your family and check in to see how you and your family started your year?

It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their A-Level results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey.
16/1/24, 3:01 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education.

We were overwhelmed and had to reject more applications because of limited seats, however were surely intrigued to know the reasons for such an immediate upsurge.

I'm sure you and your family have discussed this thoroughly. What decisions have you made for your future? Considering the cost and employment opportunities, have you compared the benefits of studying in India with the Edoofa program against other options?
30/1/24, 9:00 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Thats means $600*2 semester $1200 per year for tution fees $200 per year for internship 

$70 a month rent * 12 months = $840 a year for accommodation

Basic 3 meal sadza a day $1 per meal *3 meals a day *365 days = $1095 

Data bundles - $ 50 a month right * 12 months = $600 

Misc- $300 

Total at UZ = Exceeds $4100
30/1/24, 9:00 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Where as at Edoofa at top universities abroad you are only paying $2000-$3000 also complementary you are getting EWYL program to self finance the fees so which one is affordable ?
30/1/24, 9:19 AM - +27 67 910 5734: I don't think my parents wilk be able to pay tge money because of certain problems they are facing now so l think l will be going to join the university next year

Conducive Environment

Cultural Awareness and Global Perspective
Career guidance, Mentorships, etc.


*However, not everyone achieves success. Do you know why*?

30/1/24, 2:05 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: *Personalized mentorship and guidance throughout your course:* As your Career Counsellor, I have known you since the beginning of the process, understanding your interests, aspirations, family background and plans for your career, unlike a University officer who may come across your application for the first time and treats with the same importance like others. I personally understand where you come from and what is required for you to be successful.
30/1/24, 2:06 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
30/1/24, 2:06 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: *Financial Support and Planning:* With a flexible payment plan for registration fees spreading across 45 days, the remaining cost of education can be paid in two installments. Students are ensured to open Indian bank accounts so that parents can even deposit the fees in monthly installments.

1/2/24, 1:34 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Could you please provide an honest explanation for the delay? Given that A-level results are now available, there's a sense of urgency among students to secure places at top universities. The rapid filling of university seats is a common trend, and delays could limit options as the best opportunities are often claimed swiftly.

*Proverbs 9:9 (NIV):*
*"Instruct the wise and they will be wiser still; teach the righteous and they will add to their learning."*

Let's continue our interactive session and embrace the transformative power of education.
2/2/24, 9:23 AM - +27 67 910 5734: greetings to you sir
2/2/24, 10:36 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: And who paid for her schooling ?
2/2/24, 10:44 AM - +27 67 910 5734: Her husband
2/2/24, 2:44 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: So your parents didn't help her at all ?
2/2/24, 3:02 PM - +27 67 910 5734: they did
2/2/24, 4:23 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Given that your parents assisted her in her education, perhaps you could also request her and her husband  for support at this time. You could propose to repay her once you secure employment, considering that the average salary for graduates in India falls within the range of $800 to $1000. This might provide solution to your financial challenge.
2/2/24, 4:55 PM - +27 67 910 5734: I will try
3/2/24, 8:30 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Good morning

5/2/24, 1:09 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: I hope your family is considering the potential drawbacks of taking a gap year – the risk of top universities rejecting your application and reputable employers overlooking you for their companies. It's essential to weigh the long-term consequences before deciding on a gap year.

5/2/24, 1:54 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: I completely understand your concerns. but have to understand Education is not just a short-term investment; it's a pathway to long-term success and improvement in living conditions. Remember, Proverbs 3:13-14 (NIV) says, "Blessed are those who find wisdom, those who gain understanding, for she is more profitable than silver and yields better returns than gold."
5/2/24, 1:54 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Consider this journey as an opportunity to be a source of inspiration and a role model for your family. Education is the key that can unlock numerous doors to prosperity. Think about the long-term benefits and the positive impact it can have on your family's future.
