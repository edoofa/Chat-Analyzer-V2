16/1/24, 12:13 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Mazvita

I trust this message finds you well, and I hope you are in high spirits. In recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their A-Level results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey.
16/1/24, 12:13 PM - Ashi Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?
24/1/24, 9:19 AM - Harmehak Edoofa: Good Day @263773608257 @263772476509 @263716865384, 

I am *Ms.Harmehak,Senior Career Counsellor at Edoofa*
I hope you all are doing well

If you recall, I hosted your counselling and evaluation sessions, and you made me proud by qualifying for our prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program. I received results from all my students, happy and exhilarating with joy. Recalling our interaction, I remembered that during our session you portrayed an enormous potential of becoming a leader of tomorrow. Hence I have asked my Colleague *Mr.Sahil, Senior Academician* @919821838532 to personally look after your admission process so that we can proceed with your application on priority. 

Hence I request you to come online and continue with your admission procedures.
24/1/24, 8:10 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: I see you have gone through my messages earlier but did not respond back, *please If there is something that is concerning you because of which you are not Proceeding ahead with your process, then I would request you to come forward and address the same with me here in the group so that I can provide you with a solution to cater to your issues and guide you with your admissions procedures.*

Since my working hours for the day are over now, *I have therefore scheduled your session for 09:30 AM CAT tomorrow*

God Bless you,
Have a great day ahead!
25/1/24, 9:22 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Good Morning Everyone,

I personally noticed challenges in your admission process, but I'm here to help. Despite not being part of the admission team, as a member of the academic bench, I'll personally ensure your application is completed within three days, securing the maximum scholarship percentage possible .This will make your education more affordable than studying locally and open up maximum employment prospects. Trust me to handle everything, and let's start fresh for a successful outcome. As a dedicated effort, I'm providing you with the option to call me directly if there are any delays in the process.
25/1/24, 10:11 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Your name, in particular, caught my attention, and I was going through your Admissions Group and was shocked to see that you weren't able to complete the University registration process being a bright student .  I personally had a discussion with the Admissions Head and have decided to help you in the best possible way as I understand your calibre.  May I know, what exactly happened earlier due to which you weren't able to proceed and what are your plans as of now?

29/1/24, 4:22 PM - +263 77 360 8257: The last time I checked it was around $12 000

30/1/24, 2:49 PM - +263 77 360 8257: That is good to know please. Moving ahead, first I would like to answer your query here regarding the per annum expenses, yet, it would be $1250 per annum moving ahead from the second year of your university. I hope this is clear?
30/1/24, 3:12 PM - +263 77 247 6509: Good Evening Parents and Mazviita!
I hope you are doing well today.

As per the conversation that we had here earlier, where you wished to get a more affordable university for Mazviita's higher education, we had worked towards the same. With all the efforts we have invested, I am thrilled to inform you that your application has been accepted by one of the leading universities, MVN University in India, and they have decided to offer you a remarkable 100% scholarship. ⭐

The university will be mailing you the official offer letter shortly. However, as we received it early, we wanted to share it with you early and get a head start on our discussions. Please take your time to thoroughly review the letter, and then we will discuss its contents in detail tomorrow at 01.30 PM please.
30/1/24, 3:12 PM - +263 77 247 6509: <Media omitted>
30/1/24, 3:17 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: You got 100% then why did you not opt for it ?
30/1/24, 3:18 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
30/1/24, 3:18 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: This was another letter you recieved
30/1/24, 5:55 PM - +263 77 247 6509: Of course 100% was ok.however there were other charges amounting to 1200.and had specific dates to pay
Besides there are visa fees and flight fees.
Accomodationall those
30/1/24, 6:03 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Are you aware of cost of studying at local universities?
30/1/24, 6:03 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Share your A level results?
30/1/24, 6:05 PM - +263 77 247 6509: Yaa they are going up
30/1/24, 6:11 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Do you know we at EDOOFA received 2000 Applications in a Single Day just a week before and each day since then we are receiving not less than 1000 Applications each day from students seeking Scholarship? We were overwhelmed and had to reject more applications because of limited seats, however were surely intrigued to know the reasons for such an immediate upsurge.  Having Conversations with my other students who are already preparing to arrive in India under the Edoofa Scholarship shared some mind-boggling Screenshots from the Fee Prospectus of the Universities in Zimbabwe.

30/1/24, 6:11 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: I am shocked to compile these data for Fee Structures of some famous Public Universities of Zimbabwe.

Bindura University of Science Education (BUSE) -https://www.buse.ac.zw/fees-structure/ - ($680 per term)

Chinhoyi University of Technology (CUT) https://www.cut.ac.zw/welcome/assets/files/fees-structure/School%20of%20Engineering%20Science.pdf - ($535 per term)

University of Zimbabwe (UZ) -https://www.uz.ac.zw/index.php/faculties/160-fac-of-medicine/med-deparrtments/305-med-dpt-of-comm ($523 per term)

NUST -($870 per term)

I'm sure you and your family have discussed this thoroughly. What decisions have you made for your future? Considering the cost and employment opportunities, have you compared the benefits of studying in India with the Edoofa program against other options?
30/1/24, 6:12 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: hats means $600*2 semester $1200 per year for tution fees $200 per year for internship 

$70 a month rent * 12 months = $840 a year for accommodation

Basic 3 meal sadza a day $1 per meal *3 meals a day *365 days = $1095 

Data bundles - $ 50 a month right * 12 months = $600 

Misc- $300 

Total at UZ = Exceeds $4500
Have you calculated this ?
Where as at Edoofa at top universities abroad you are only paying $2000-$3000 also complementary you are getting EWYL program to self finance the fees  you also were given 100% option so which one is affordable ?
30/1/24, 7:13 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
31/1/24, 10:20 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: *Good morning Everyone!*

I hope you're well. I sincerely apologize for the delay yesterday; I was engaged in a meeting. Thank you for your patience.

1/2/24, 11:15 AM - +263 77 360 8257: Yes please , Good morning
1/2/24, 2:06 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: When comparing the expenses of local universities with the opportunity to study in India through Edoofa, the initial costs may seem high. However, it's crucial to weigh these expenses against the potential long-term advantages and the noticeable disparity in employment opportunities. In Zimbabwe, where graduates often face challenges in securing jobs, resorting to roles at gas stations or selling sim cards on the streets is common, with an earning potential ranging from $200-$400.
1/2/24, 2:06 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Now, consider the alternative scenario of pursuing a degree in India. Not only is the process more feasible, but it also opens doors to a job market where graduates typically earn between $800-$1000 a month on average. Has your family thoroughly deliberated on this substantial contrast in potential earnings and career prospects when evaluating the costs associated with education in India compared to local universities?
1/2/24, 2:07 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Importantly, the cost of education at MVN University, facilitated by Edoofa, is notably more affordable than attending any recognized university in Zimbabwe. This not only provides a cost-effective option but also ensures access to quality education at a reasonable expense. Have you taken into account the considerable financial advantage and value for money that opting for MVN University through Edoofa could offer in comparison to available options in Zimbabwe?
1/2/24, 3:10 PM - +263 77 247 6509: Morning hwz yu
1/2/24, 3:24 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: I am fine how are you ?
1/2/24, 3:32 PM - +263 77 247 6509: Yes it's better but funds to kick start the degree are not permitting us.The 1200 fee is not available.the vida fees and air fares
1/2/24, 3:37 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: You don't pay everything at one you can request for a flexible payment plan.
1/2/24, 4:20 PM - +263 77 247 6509: According to what the letter demands there were deadlines

Seize the opportunity to break free from limitations. Keep in mind Philippians 4:13 (NIV), "I can do all this through him who gives me strength." Let education empower your child!*
