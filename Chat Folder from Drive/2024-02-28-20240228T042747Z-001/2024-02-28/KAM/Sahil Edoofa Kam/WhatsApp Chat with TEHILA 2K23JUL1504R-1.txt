12/1/24, 6:07 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Tehila,

I trust this message finds you in good health. As we step into the second week of January, I wanted to reach out and share an exciting milestone that India as a country achieved within the first week of 2024 - the successful India's Chandrayaan-3 Engine Test.
12/1/24, 6:07 PM - Kirti Edoofa: This accomplishment is responsible for the third lunar mission, aiming to land a rover on the Moon's south polar region and conduct scientific studies that could check Moon's viability to sustain life. It signifies a significant scientific advancement, laying the groundwork for future progress.
12/1/24, 6:07 PM - Kirti Edoofa: This achievement has not only pushed boundaries but also inspired young minds all over the world to pursue their dreams. On the same note, I wanted to extend my heartiest wishes for the New Year to you and your family and check in to see how you and your family started your year?

*I am Mr Sahil, Senior Career Counsellor at Edoofa*

If you remember well, I hosted the counselling and evaluation sessions for you through the Edoofa Scholarship Program from which you have made me proud by qualifying for the program.

29/1/24, 9:07 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Recalling our counseling and evaluation sessions, I take pride in your qualification for our esteemed Edoofa Scholarship Program. Recently,  I was going through your Admissions Group and was shocked to see that you weren't able to complete the University registration process being a bright student and I still remember your passion for career and goals, making you one of my favourite students.  I personally had a discussion with the Admissions Head and have decided to help you in the best possible way as I understand your calibre.  May I know, what exactly happened due to which you weren't able to proceed and what are your plans as of now?
29/1/24, 12:19 PM - +260 95 0590514: Good afternoon sir we had requested to for I daughter to write her exams and permission was given and she has continued with lessons from last
29/1/24, 12:20 PM - +260 95 0590514: She is very ready now please
29/1/24, 12:33 PM - +260 97 7850766: I'm available now .
29/1/24, 1:16 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Can you please share grade 12 results ?
29/1/24, 1:19 PM - +260 97 7850766: Okay
29/1/24, 2:11 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Yes please

30/1/24, 8:45 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: *Good morning Everyone!*  let's draw inspiration from the timeless wisdom found in the Bible:

*"As the scriptures teach, knowledge is a steadfast companion. A person enlightened by wisdom is held in high regard across all realms. The brilliance of education surpasses the allure of beauty and the vigor of youth."*

 With positive energy, let's continue our interactive session and embrace the transformative power of education. So shall we begin ?
30/1/24, 12:17 PM - +260 97 7850766: Yes am ready
30/1/24, 12:58 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Being a senior academic and counsellor, my aspirations for young learners like you are similar. I firmly believe higher education should combine the following for a learner to achieve their goals:-

Quality Education
Conducive Environment
Critical Thinking and Practical learning skills
Technological Literacy and Attachments
Cultural Awareness and Global Perspective
Career guidance, Mentorships, etc.


*However, not everyone achieves success. Do you know why*?
30/1/24, 12:59 PM - +260 97 7850766: No I don't know why .
30/1/24, 1:40 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
30/1/24, 1:40 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: It is important to know why the Edoofa guidance will be unique compared to the normal University approach.
30/1/24, 1:40 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: *Personalized mentorship and guidance throughout your course:* As your Career Counsellor, I have known you since the beginning of the process, understanding your interests, aspirations, family background and plans for your career, unlike a University officer who may come across your application for the first time and treats with the same importance like others. I personally understand where you come from and what is required for you to be successful.
30/1/24, 1:40 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
30/1/24, 1:41 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: *Financial Support and Planning:* With a flexible payment plan for registration fees spreading across 45 days, the remaining cost of education can be paid in two installments. Students are ensured to open Indian bank accounts so that parents can even deposit the fees in monthly installments.

30/1/24, 1:41 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: These are just a few of the various benefits and keeping all this in mind, are you ready to step into your higher education through the Edoofa Program which is the most popular scholarship in Africa?
30/1/24, 1:43 PM - +260 97 7850766: Yes I am ready
30/1/24, 1:45 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Perfect, To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is B.Sc (Medical Lab Technology) and your intake is in August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information is accurate?
30/1/24, 1:46 PM - +260 97 7850766: Yes it's accurate indeed
30/1/24, 1:59 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: This message was deleted
30/1/24, 5:19 PM - +260 95 0590514: Ok
30/1/24, 6:03 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: As I have promised, the Edoofa Admissions team will be submitting your application to multiple universities that will evaluate your application and upon being eligible, you receive the offer letters with comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. *I will guide you to the best education institution/university associated with us that aligns with your vision and interest and would provide you with a conducive environment for your holistic development and to fulfil your career goals.*

Upon receiving the Offer Letter, you will have a few weeks to pay a portion of your university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. We discussed the registration fee during our counselling sessions. May I know, what do you recall about the same now?
30/1/24, 7:13 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
30/1/24, 7:14 PM - +260 97 7850766: Okay .
31/1/24, 9:40 AM - +260 97 7850766: Am online
31/1/24, 10:25 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: *Good morning Everyone!*

*“It is impossible for a man to learn what he thinks he already knows.”*

With positive energy, let's continue our interactive session and embrace the transformative power of education. So shall we begin ?
31/1/24, 10:30 AM - +260 97 7850766: Yes
31/1/24, 12:19 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Can you please answer this ?
31/1/24, 12:28 PM - +260 97 7850766: My mother told me that she had paid some money was it about that.
31/1/24, 12:38 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Let me help you with a better understanding. *Usually, the registration fee is an additional fee apart from the cost of education but Edoofians receive an exclusive benefit where it is a part of the cost of education itself.* Let me give you an example:-
31/1/24, 12:38 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: As we discussed in the counselling session, the cost of education in India ranges from $6000-$8000 per annum which is reduced to $2000-$3000 per annum through the Edoofa Scholarship Program which includes the registration fee, remaining tuition fees, Accommodation, Food, Wifi, Laundry, library fee etc. Now, let us assume,

1. *Tuition Fee*: $1800 per annum
2. *Food and Accommodation Fee*: $1000 per annum 
Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum
3. *Registration Fee to be paid:* $1000 

This means this registration fee that you pay will be subtracted from the cost of education ($2800-$1000= $1800) and the remaining fee of $1800 can be paid in two installments. The first part of $900 within 3 days after your arrival here in India and the remaining $900 will be due in December 2024, or before your second semester begins.

*Do you have any questions for me regarding the same?*
31/1/24, 12:39 PM - +260 97 7850766: No for now
31/1/24, 2:19 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: The registration fee can be paid either in two equal parts(The first half within 15 days and the second half within 30 days) or in one go itself.

Are you clear with the details?
31/1/24, 5:01 PM - +260 97 7850766: Yes we are
1/2/24, 9:00 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Good morning!
I hope you're well. I sincerely apologize for the delay yesterday; I was engaged in a meeting. Thank you for your patience. As we resume our discussion, I'm reminded of Proverbs 16:3 (NIV): *"Commit to the Lord whatever you do, and he will establish your plans."* Shall we proceed with our decision now?
1/2/24, 9:46 AM - +260 97 7850766: Yes
1/2/24, 12:21 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: I understand that you are interested in this golden opportunity to study in India under the given Scholarship. I do realize that your Family Members may have other concerns and this is the reason I have requested our Program Director Mr. Abhinav to spare some time to talk to your Parents about this. Shall I share the schedule with you?
1/2/24, 12:25 PM - +260 97 7850766: Yes you may
1/2/24, 12:27 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: What time are parents available ?
1/2/24, 12:29 PM - +260 97 7850766: Am not really sure let me find out
1/2/24, 2:39 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Could you please provide with exact availability time ? Given that Grade 12 results in Zambia and A level result in Zimbabwe results are now available, there's a sense of urgency among students to secure places at top universities. The rapid filling of university seats is a common trend, and delays could limit options as the best opportunities are often claimed swiftly.
