It signifies a significant scientific advancement, laying the groundwork for future progress.
11/1/24, 4:16 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This achievement has not only pushed boundaries but also has inspired young minds all over the world to pursue their dreams. On the same note, I wanted to extend my heartiest wishes for the New Year to you and your family and check in to see how you and your family started your year?
16/1/24, 7:52 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Sheunesu,

I trust this message finds you well, and I hope you are in high spirits. I was hoping to get a response from your end following my previous messages. However, in recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their A-Level results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey.
16/1/24, 7:52 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?
29/1/24, 9:00 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Good Day @263771528669 @26774600373 ,

Recently, the A-level results from all my students have brought immense joy. Your name, in particular, caught my attention, and I was going through your Admissions Group and was shocked to see that you weren't able to complete the University registration process being a bright student and I still remember your passion for career and goals, making you one of my favourite students.  I personally had a discussion with the Admissions Head and have decided to help you in the best possible way as I understand your calibre.  May I know, what exactly happened due to which you weren't able to proceed and what are your plans as of now?
29/1/24, 12:51 PM - +263 77 152 8669: Greetings to you all!  I'm doing fine as well. I'm sorry that l wasn't available because l had considered that there's  need for more money money to study abroad of which this amount l won't be able to manage it. I was demotivated by the time l carried my projects. My earnings didn't not accumulate as l expected. In some time l worked hard expecting that l would get more credits but at the end l find that l wasn't getting more credits. That l time l was told that l earned $98  credits in my account. It took almost 2 months with these credits in my accou,nt so l ascertained that l won't be  able to finance my studies abroad alone
29/1/24, 12:53 PM - +263 77 152 8669: <Media omitted>
29/1/24, 1:45 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: I can understand It's disappointing when efforts don't yield expected results but I want to assure you that initial it takes time during training phase but it was good to see that you were able to earn credits even in training.

We were overwhelmed and had to reject more applications because of limited seats, however were surely intrigued to know the reasons for such an immediate upsurge.  Having Conversations with my other students who are already preparing to arrive in India under the Edoofa Scholarship shared some mind-boggling Screenshots from the Fee Prospectus of the Universities in Zimbabwe.

6/2/24, 11:53 AM - +263 77 152 8669: Thank you sir! Honestly,  l wanna come there is a big problem
6/2/24, 11:56 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Can you elaborate please ?
7/2/24, 10:08 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Good morning
How are you doing today?
7/2/24, 11:17 AM - +263 77 152 8669: I'm fine sir, thanks for asking!
7/2/24, 12:13 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Did you write an email to academic board to change the course ?
7/2/24, 12:14 PM - +263 77 152 8669: Yes sir, l did that
7/2/24, 12:14 PM - +263 77 152 8669: <Media omitted>
7/2/24, 12:55 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Noted
7/2/24, 12:56 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Perfect, To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is Bachelor of Commerce and your intake is in August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information is accurate?
7/2/24, 12:57 PM - +263 77 152 8669: Yes it's correct
7/2/24, 1:33 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: As I have promised, the Edoofa Admissions team will be submitting your application to multiple universities that will evaluate your application and upon being eligible, you receive the offer letters with comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. *I will guide you to the best education institution/university associated with us that aligns with your vision and interest and would provide you with a conducive environment for your holistic development and to fulfil your career goals.*

Upon receiving the Offer Letter, you will have a few weeks to pay a portion of your university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. We discussed the registration fee during our counselling sessions. May I know, what do you recall about the same now?
7/2/24, 1:50 PM - +263 77 152 8669: I still remember that we discussed that the  registration fee is around $750. Another thing is that this registration fee will be part of my tuition fee which means it will be deducted from my the fee l pay for my first semester there in lndia.
7/2/24, 2:15 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: As we discussed in the counselling session, the cost of education in India ranges from $6000-$8000 per annum which is reduced to $2000-$3000 per annum through the Edoofa Scholarship Program which includes the registration fee, remaining tuition fees, Accommodation, Food, Wifi, Laundry, library fee etc. Now, let us assume,

1. *Tuition Fee*: $1800 per annum
2. *Food and Accommodation Fee*: $1000 per annum 
Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum
3. *Registration Fee to be paid:* $1000 

This means this registration fee that you pay will be subtracted from the cost of education ($2800-$1000= $1800) and the remaining fee of $1800 can be paid in two installments. The first part of $900 within 3 days after your arrival here in India and the remaining $900 will be due in December 2024, or before your second semester begins.

*Do you have any questions for me regarding the same?*
7/2/24, 2:23 PM - +263 77 152 8669: I don't have any question. Everything wad clear but the problem is that it will be difficult for my mother to raise that figure which is paid per semester. I thought that l could be better if l work and get some money before I come there
7/2/24, 2:26 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: I personally will help you get higher quantum of scholarship .
7/2/24, 2:26 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: The registration fee can be paid either in two equal parts(The first half within 15 days and the second half within 30 days) or in one go itself.

Are you clear with the details?
7/2/24, 2:26 PM - +263 77 152 8669: Yes I'm clear with that si
7/2/24, 2:27 PM - +263 77 152 8669: Sir
7/2/24, 2:37 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: I understand that you are interested in this golden opportunity to study in India under the given Scholarship. I do realize that your Family Members may have other concerns and this is the reason I have requested our Program Director Mr. Abhinav to spare some time to talk to your Parents about this. Shall I share the schedule with you?
7/2/24, 2:39 PM - +263 77 152 8669: Yes l will talk to my mother about it. I'm sure she will be so ecstatic
7/2/24, 2:39 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: By when can she come online ?
7/2/24, 2:40 PM - +263 77 152 8669: Is that of today?
7/2/24, 2:40 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Yes
