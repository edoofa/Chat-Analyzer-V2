12/1/24, 5:22 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Tanyaradzwa,

I trust this message finds you in good health. As we step into the second week of January, I wanted to reach out and share an exciting milestone that India as a country achieved within the first week of 2024 - the successful India's Chandrayaan-3 Engine Test.
12/1/24, 5:22 PM - Kirti Edoofa: This accomplishment is responsible for the third lunar mission, aiming to land a rover on the Moon's south polar region and conduct scientific studies that could check Moon's viability to sustain life. It signifies a significant scientific advancement, laying the groundwork for future progress.
12/1/24, 5:22 PM - Kirti Edoofa: This achievement has not only pushed boundaries but also inspired young minds all over the world to pursue their dreams. On the same note, I wanted to extend my heartiest wishes for the New Year to you and your family and check in to see how you and your family started your year?
16/1/24, 11:58 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Proud Edoofians,

I trust this message finds you well, and I hope you are in high spirits. In recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their A-Level results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey.
16/1/24, 11:58 AM - Kirti Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?
22/1/24, 9:00 PM - +263 78 275 9892: I haven't seen them yet ,but l will definitely send them tomorrow
29/1/24, 9:42 AM - Harmehak Edoofa: Good Day ⁩@263782759892 @263773888336 , 

I am Ms.Harmehak,Senior Career Counsellor at Edoofa
I hope you all are doing well

If you recall, I hosted your counselling and evaluation sessions, and you made me proud by qualifying for our prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program. I received results from all my students, happy and exhilarating with joy. Recalling our interaction, I remembered that during our session you portrayed an enormous potential of becoming a leader of tomorrow. Hence I have asked my Colleague Mr.Sahil, Senior Academician ⁩@919821838532 to personally look after your admission process so that we can proceed with your application on priority. 

Hence I request you to come online and continue with your admission procedures.
29/1/24, 6:45 PM - +263 78 275 9892: Okay let's continue maam
30/1/24, 8:33 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Good Day , 
*I am Mr Sahil, Senior Academician at Edoofa*
30/1/24, 8:34 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: I personally noticed challenges in your admission process, so I'm here to help. Despite not being part of the admission team, as a member of the academic bench, I'll personally ensure your application is completed within three days, securing the maximum scholarship percentage possible .This will make your education more affordable than studying locally and open up maximum employment prospects. Trust me to handle everything, and let's start fresh for a successful outcome. As a dedicated effort, I'm providing you with the option to call me directly if there are any delays in the process.
30/1/24, 8:34 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: I personally had a discussion with the Admissions Head and have decided to help you in the best possible way as I understand your calibre.  May I know, what exactly happened due to which you weren't able to proceed and what are your plans as of now?
30/1/24, 6:52 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: I was anticipating your response today but unfortunately, you were not available all day. I look forward to your active participation tomorrow at 9:30 AM CAT time. I am eager for our interaction. As we embark on a new day, let's reflect on the wisdom from Proverbs 3:5-6 (NIV): *'Trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding; in all your ways submit to him, and he will make your paths straight.'*
31/1/24, 10:00 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Good morning! Drawing inspiration from biblical wisdom: 

*"In the sacred texts, we find that knowledge is a faithful companion, elevating one to respect beyond borders. Education outshines both beauty and youth."*

Let's fuel our positive energy and continue our interactive session.
1/2/24, 8:36 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Good Morning 
I hope you are doing well!
I've noticed that my messages have been read but not responded to. Is everything alright?
1/2/24, 9:16 PM - +263 78 275 9892: Noo l didn't have data
1/2/24, 9:17 PM - +263 78 275 9892: I told you l lost my father ,l can't afford  the fees anymore
1/2/24, 9:24 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
1/2/24, 10:12 PM - +263 78 275 9892: I don't have money
2/2/24, 9:23 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Good morning! let's draw inspiration from the timeless wisdom found in the Bible:

*Proverbs 9:9 (NIV):*
*"Instruct the wise and they will be wiser still; teach the righteous and they will add to their learning."*

Let's continue our interactive session and embrace the transformative power of education.
2/2/24, 9:24 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Which part of the fees is not affordable for him?
2/2/24, 10:06 AM - +263 78 275 9892: From the flight ticket ,we can't afford it
2/2/24, 10:17 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Consider that the fare is a one-time expense  for studying abroad as you travel once abroad, typically ranging around $400 to $550 and you have months to save it . This cost is notably lower compared to the cumulative expenses incurred when studying locally. If you calculate the daily commuting expenses, even at a modest rate of $5 - $9 per day for 200-250 days in a year, the total easily surpasses $1000-$1400. Opting for education abroad not only provides a unique global experience but also proves to be more economical in terms of daily commuting costs.
2/2/24, 10:19 AM - +263 78 275 9892: It expensive ,my father is the one who was earning for the family
2/2/24, 1:31 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Have you discussed these calculations with him? It's crucial to walk him through the numbers. If he considers the long-term perspective, he'll realize that the fees he'll be paying for you to study in Zimbabwe may surpass the costs associated with your course in India. Additionally, employment opportunities are limited in Zimbabwe, Even for top university in Zimbabwe like UZ graduates who often find themselves selling SIM cards on the streets or working at gas stations due to the education quality and job scarcity. There's also the uncertainty of completing the course on time, given the history of students facing delays due to riots or political influences. When you calculate the potential additional costs for these extra years, the total expense of completing a degree in Zimbabwe could be three times more than studying in India.

2/2/24, 1:33 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
2/2/24, 1:33 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: I am shocked to compile these data for Fee Structures of some famous Public Universities of Zimbabwe.

Bindura University of Science Education (BUSE) -https://www.buse.ac.zw/fees-structure/ - ($680 per term)

Chinhoyi University of Technology (CUT) https://www.cut.ac.zw/welcome/assets/files/fees-structure/School%20of%20Engineering%20Science.pdf - ($535 per term)

University of Zimbabwe (UZ) -https://www.uz.ac.zw/index.php/faculties/160-fac-of-medicine/med-deparrtments/305-med-dpt-of-comm ($523 per term)

NUST -($870 per term)

I'm sure you and your family have discussed this thoroughly. What decisions have you made for your future? Considering the cost and employment opportunities, have you compared the benefits of studying in India with the Edoofa program against other options?
3/2/24, 8:30 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Good morning
How are you doing today?
5/2/24, 9:12 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Good morning! let's draw inspiration from the timeless wisdom found in the Bible:

*Proverbs 2:10-11 (NIV):*
*"For wisdom will enter your heart, and knowledge will be pleasant to your soul. Discretion will protect you, and understanding will guard you."*

Let's continue our interactive session and embrace the transformative power of education
5/2/24, 7:23 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: *Embrace education as the key to a brighter future. Proverbs 4:7 (NIV) wisely states, "The beginning of wisdom is this: Get wisdom." Seize the opportunity to break free from limitations. Keep in mind Philippians 4:13 (NIV), "I can do all this through him who gives me strength." Let education empower your child!*

Over the past few days, we've been trying to connect with you to discuss your child's academic journey. We understand the financial commitments involved in providing quality education for your child. The challenges in Africa, particularly the uncertainty of employment after completing a bachelor's degree, are evident.

Considering the urgency of your child's education, I've scheduled a session for *tomorrow at 09:30 AM CAT* .Looking forward to connecting with you tomorrow.
6/2/24, 9:36 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Good morning! let's draw inspiration from the timeless wisdom found in the Bible:

*Proverbs 1:5:*

*"Let the wise listen and add to their learning.' In the tapestry of progress, education is the thread that weaves nations together. As India seeks wisdom, let us prioritize education, creating a future where knowledge transcends boundaries and resonates more profoundly than ever. A commitment to learning is a commitment to a thriving, united nation."*

Let's continue our interactive session and embrace the transformative power of education ,Shall we start?
