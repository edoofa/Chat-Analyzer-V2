This transition marks a significant chapter in my life as I will be bidding farewell to the cherished moments at the Admissions Team in Edoofa.

8/1/24, 2:07 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Before we get into the specifics of your admission journey and talk about your admission process, I would like to share an exciting milestone that India as a country achieved within the first week of 2024 – the successful *India's Chandrayaan-3 Engine Test.* This accomplishment is responsible for the third lunar mission, aiming to land a rover on the Moon's south polar region and conduct scientific studies that could check Moon's viability to sustain life. It signifies a significant scientific advancement, laying the groundwork for future progress.

I trust this message finds you well, and I hope you are in high spirits. I was hoping to get a response from your end following my previous messages. However, in recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their A-Level results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey.
16/1/24, 7:45 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?

I personally had a discussion with the Admissions Head and have decided to help you in the best possible way as I understand your calibre.

Career guidance, Mentorships, etc.


*However, not everyone achieves success. Do you know why*?
6/2/24, 12:30 PM - +263 77 528 4875: Great!!

6/2/24, 12:34 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
6/2/24, 12:34 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: It is important to know why the Edoofa guidance will be unique compared to the normal University approach.
6/2/24, 12:34 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: *Personalized mentorship and guidance throughout your course:* As your Career Counsellor, I have known you since the beginning of the process, understanding your interests, aspirations, family background and plans for your career, unlike a University officer who may come across your application for the first time and treats with the same importance like others. I personally understand where you come from and what is required for you to be successful.
6/2/24, 12:35 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
6/2/24, 12:35 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: *Financial Support and Planning:* With a flexible payment plan for registration fees spreading across 45 days, the remaining cost of education can be paid in two installments.

6/2/24, 12:36 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
6/2/24, 12:36 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: These are just a few of the various benefits and keeping all this in mind, are you ready to step into your higher education through the Edoofa Program which is the most popular scholarship in Africa?
6/2/24, 12:43 PM - +263 77 528 4875: Well explained and inspiring thank you Sir I understand and true that
6/2/24, 12:44 PM - +263 77 528 4875: Great!
6/2/24, 12:44 PM - +263 77 528 4875: I am more than ready Sir
6/2/24, 12:46 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Perfect, To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is BA (Psychology)and your intake is in August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information is accurate?
6/2/24, 12:47 PM - +263 77 528 4875: Yes it is accurate
6/2/24, 12:47 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: As I have promised, the Edoofa Admissions team will be submitting your application to multiple universities that will evaluate your application and upon being eligible, you receive the offer letters with comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. *I will guide you to the best education institution/university associated with us that aligns with your vision and interest and would provide you with a conducive environment for your holistic development and to fulfil your career goals.*

Upon receiving the Offer Letter, you will have a few weeks to pay a portion of your university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. We discussed the registration fee during our counselling sessions. May I know, what do you recall about the same now?
6/2/24, 12:55 PM - +263 77 528 4875: Awesome! What I remember is Edoofa's Tuition and living fees is $2000-3000 including food and living expenses.Also through EWYL program I can be able to reduce the costs as this will make my education affordable through employability.
6/2/24, 1:00 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: As we discussed in the counselling session, the cost of education in India ranges from $6000-$8000 per annum which is reduced to $2000-$3000 per annum through the Edoofa Scholarship Program which includes the registration fee, remaining tuition fees, Accommodation, Food, Wifi, Laundry, library fee etc. Now, let us assume,

1. *Tuition Fee*: $1800 per annum
2. *Food and Accommodation Fee*: $1000 per annum 
Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum
3. *Registration Fee to be paid:* $1000 

This means this registration fee that you pay will be subtracted from the cost of education ($2800-$1000= $1800) and the remaining fee of $1800 can be paid in two installments. The first part of $900 within 3 days after your arrival here in India and the remaining $900 will be due in December 2024, or before your second semester begins.

*Do you have any questions for me regarding the same?*
6/2/24, 1:02 PM - +263 77 528 4875: With me I do not have any questions.I am not sure or my parents do have questions
6/2/24, 1:20 PM - +263 77 957 0923: Good day sir we are on the same page sir may be with time if we have some questions we will ask.
6/2/24, 1:55 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: The registration fee can be paid either in two equal parts(The first half within 15 days and the second half within 30 days) or in one go itself.

Are you clear with the details?
6/2/24, 2:57 PM - +263 77 528 4875: Yes yes I understand
6/2/24, 3:43 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: With this, we can proceed to step 4 of the admission cycle, i.e., Offer Letter from University/College. The universities will take three to five days to evaluate your application, after which, if they accept your application for a scholarship, they will send you a scholarship offer letter. In the offer letter, the scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee will be mentioned.

On this note, let us conclude our conversation for today. I will reach out to you once we get an update from the universities. Wish you a blessed day ahead, and please extend our regards to your family as well.
6/2/24, 3:44 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: I want you to share the following documents with us as they are required for your university application preparation:

*1. A-Level Result/Letter of Recommendation/Statement of Entry (A-Level).*

*2. O-Level Results*

*3. Identity proof (International Traveling Passport or National ID or Birth Certificate)*
6/2/24, 3:57 PM - +263 77 528 4875: Awesome news.
