16/1/24, 11:57 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Nkosiyokuthula,

I trust this message finds you well, and I hope you are in high spirits. In recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their A-Level results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey.
16/1/24, 7:32 PM - Ashi Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?
29/1/24, 8:38 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Good Day @27712762445 , 
*I am Mr Sahil, Senior Career Counsellor at Edoofa*

If you remember well, I hosted the counselling and evaluation sessions for you through the Edoofa Scholarship Program from which you have made me proud by qualifying for the program.

29/1/24, 8:38 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Recalling our counseling and evaluation sessions, I take pride in your qualification for our esteemed Edoofa Scholarship Program. Recently, the A-level results from all my students have brought immense joy. Your name, in particular, caught my attention, and I was going through your Admissions Group and was shocked to see that you weren't able to complete the University registration process being a bright student and I still remember your passion for career and goals, making you one of my favourite students.  I personally had a discussion with the Admissions Head and have decided to help you in the best possible way as I understand your calibre.  May I know, what exactly happened due to which you weren't able to proceed and what are your plans as of now?

30/1/24, 8:37 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: *Good morning Everyone!*  let's draw inspiration from the timeless wisdom found in the Bible:

*"As the scriptures teach, knowledge is a steadfast companion. A person enlightened by wisdom is held in high regard across all realms. The brilliance of education surpasses the allure of beauty and the vigor of youth."*

 With positive energy, let's continue our interactive session and embrace the transformative power of education. So shall we begin ?
30/1/24, 6:53 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: I was anticipating your response today but unfortunately, you were not available all day. I look forward to your active participation tomorrow at 9:30 AM CAT time. I am eager for our interaction. As we embark on a new day, let's reflect on the wisdom from Proverbs 3:5-6 (NIV): *'Trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding; in all your ways submit to him, and he will make your paths straight.'*
31/1/24, 10:06 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: *Good morning Everyone!*

*“It is impossible for a man to learn what he thinks he already knows.”*

With positive energy, let's continue our interactive session and embrace the transformative power of education. So shall we begin ?
1/2/24, 8:44 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Good morning!
I trust you are doing well. I've observed that my messages have been read but not responded to. In moments of silence, I'm reminded of Psalm 37:7 (NIV): "Be still before the Lord and wait patiently for him." Is everything alright?
2/2/24, 9:09 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: How are you?

5/2/24, 9:15 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Good morning! let's draw inspiration from the timeless wisdom found in the Bible:

*Proverbs 2:10-11 (NIV):*
*"For wisdom will enter your heart, and knowledge will be pleasant to your soul. Discretion will protect you, and understanding will guard you."*

Let's continue our interactive session and embrace the transformative power of education
5/2/24, 7:23 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: *Embrace education as the key to a brighter future. Proverbs 4:7 (NIV) wisely states, "The beginning of wisdom is this: Get wisdom." Seize the opportunity to break free from limitations. Keep in mind Philippians 4:13 (NIV), "I can do all this through him who gives me strength." Let education empower your child!*

Over the past few days, we've been trying to connect with you to discuss your child's academic journey. We understand the financial commitments involved in providing quality education for your child. The challenges in Africa, particularly the uncertainty of employment after completing a bachelor's degree, are evident.

Considering the urgency of your child's education, I've scheduled a session for *tomorrow at 09:30 AM CAT* .Looking forward to connecting with you tomorrow.
6/2/24, 9:36 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Good morning! let's draw inspiration from the timeless wisdom found in the Bible:

*Proverbs 1:5:*

*"Let the wise listen and add to their learning.' In the tapestry of progress, education is the thread that weaves nations together. As India seeks wisdom, let us prioritize education, creating a future where knowledge transcends boundaries and resonates more profoundly than ever. A commitment to learning is a commitment to a thriving, united nation."*

Let's continue our interactive session and embrace the transformative power of education ,Shall we start?
