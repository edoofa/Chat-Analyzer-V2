16/1/24, 11:36 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Melody,

I trust this message finds you well, and I hope you are in high spirits. In recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their A-Level results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey.
16/1/24, 11:36 AM - Kirti Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?

If you recall, I hosted your counselling and evaluation sessions, and you made me proud by qualifying for our prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program. I received results from all my students, happy and exhilarating with joy. Recalling our interaction, I remembered that during our session you portrayed an enormous potential of becoming a leader of tomorrow. Hence I have asked my Colleague *Mr.Sahil, Senior Academician* @919821838532 to personally look after your admission process so that we can proceed with your application on priority. 

Hence I request you to come online and continue with your admission procedures.

15/2/24, 10:30 AM - +263 78 749 1932: I can't make it to the summit because i have no money to pay for transport inorder to reach Harare. That's also why i can't go ahead with the process because apparently things are not okay at home, my mother lost her job as the company she worked for was shut down and my father had apply for a loan inorderto undergo the eye operation again. My father's salary can't cover mine &  my sister's fees plus household expenses. It's so unfortunate but i have to stay at home until we are back on our feet. That's why i was hoping if you can start the reversal process of my registration fees that money would help me a lot.
