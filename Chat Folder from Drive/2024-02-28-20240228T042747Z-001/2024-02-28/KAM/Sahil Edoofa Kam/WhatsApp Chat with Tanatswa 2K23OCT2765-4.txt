With great excitement and pride, I also want to share that over the past few days, the Edoofa team has been immersed in an exciting event we had in store for our students. Edoofa hosted a conference - the Symposium of Leaders, Innovators, and Creators at Edoofa, also known as 'SLICE-CON.'
16/1/24, 10:32 AM - Ashi Edoofa: The conference was attended by all the Edoofians of 2023 and a few senior Edoofians from previous batches. It focused on the art of creation, innovation, and, most importantly, the mindset required to make an impact in one's career.

Their presence added immense value, providing students with the opportunity to engage in transformative conversations.

Our Edoofians maximized this opportunity, having life-changing conversations with these influential figures. The main objective of the event was to emphasize the importance of thinking outside the box, and encouraging students to believe in themselves and their dreams. Before we discuss your admission journey further, I wanted to share a glimpse of the event, and I hope you are excited to attend similar events when you come to India.

16/1/24, 8:00 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know, Over the past couple of days, we also had the pleasure of conversing with some of our students who expressed their joy upon receiving their A-Level results.

Reflecting on my own school days, I vividly recall the mix of excitement and anticipation surrounding the result day. It is an important moment that shapes the path of one’s academic journey.
16/1/24, 8:01 PM - Ashi Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?

16/1/24, 8:24 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright, As you have been waiting regarding your concern let me help you understand that the enrollment fee you've paid is refundable only if, as an organization, we fail to assist you in securing a scholarship opportunity for your higher education in India. However, this is not the case for you, as you have received a scholarship offer letter from MVN University, making you ineligible for a refund according to our policy.

While I am more than willing to explain this policy in detail, I am also concerned that we are here to help you out but you are not willing to change your mind here.
16/1/24, 8:30 PM - +27 62 556 9098: Oky please may you stipulate where we had an agreement on that .Because if you could have stated it i was not going to continue asking about it.I remember we had a conversation through  a video call and i had to ask him he told me that you will get a refund, so please  may i have my refund. Thank you.

17/1/24, 8:42 AM - Ashi Edoofa: No worries, let me help you understand the process better please. The enrollment fee you paid for the enrollment in Edoofa Scholarship program is refundable only if we fail to assist your child in securing a scholarship opportunity for their higher education in India. However, since you have already received a scholarship offer letter from MVN University, you are not eligible for a refund according to our policy. I hope that's clear, right ?

Recently, the A-level results from all my students have brought immense joy. Your name, in particular, caught my attention, and I was going through your Admissions Group and was shocked to see that you weren't able to complete the University registration process being a bright student and I still remember your passion for career and goals, making you one of my favourite students.  I personally had a discussion with the Admissions Head and have decided to help you in the best possible way as I understand your calibre.

24/1/24, 2:51 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: It's important to note that the refund policy is contingent on specific circumstances. If Edoofa fails to provide admission, a refund may be applicable. However, if a student is unable or unwilling to accept the admission, the refund may not be applicable, as clearly outlined in the acceptance letter terms.
