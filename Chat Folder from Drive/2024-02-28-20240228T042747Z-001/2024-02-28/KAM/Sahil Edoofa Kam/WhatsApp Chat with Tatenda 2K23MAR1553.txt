I received results from all my students, happy and exhilarating with joy. Recalling our interaction, I remembered that during our session you portrayed an enormous potential of becoming a leader of tomorrow. Hence I have asked my Colleague *Mr.Sahil, Senior Academician* to personally look after your admission process so that we can proceed with your application on priority.

Recently, the A-level results from all my students have brought immense joy. Your name, in particular, caught my attention, and I was going through your Admissions Group and was shocked to see that you weren't able to complete the University registration process being a bright student and I still remember your passion for career and goals, making you one of my favourite students.  I personally had a discussion with the Admissions Head and have decided to help you in the best possible way as I understand your calibre.  May I know, what exactly happened due to which you weren't able to proceed and what are your plans as of now?
23/1/24, 8:19 PM - +263 78 489 1629: Regarding Galgotias university, my parents were not in the best of financial situations at the moment, so they could not pay the registration fee.. In recent developments I was really hoping I could get another admission letter from your esteemed universities...

29/1/24, 11:52 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Do you know we at EDOOFA received 2000 Applications in a Single Day just a week before and each day since then we are receiving not less than 1000 Applications each day from students seeking Scholarship? We were overwhelmed and had to reject more applications because of limited seats, however were surely intrigued to know the reasons for such an immediate upsurge.  Having Conversations with my other students who are already preparing to arrive in India under the Edoofa Scholarship shared some mind-boggling Screenshots from the Fee Prospectus of the Universities in Zimbabwe.

Bindura University of Science Education (BUSE) -https://www.buse.ac.zw/fees-structure/ - ($680 per term)

Chinhoyi University of Technology (CUT) https://www.cut.ac.zw/welcome/assets/files/fees-structure/School%20of%20Engineering%20Science.pdf - ($535 per term)

NUST -($870 per term)

I'm sure you and your family have discussed this thoroughly. What decisions have you made for your future? Considering the cost and employment opportunities, have you compared the benefits of studying in India with the Edoofa program against other options?

30/1/24, 11:11 AM - +263 78 489 1629: I have and I've met little big obstacles in my research.. I've encountered how some of the Indian universities, where students are going, are providing outdated syllabuses of which are not internationally recognized, so I'm having difficulties in making a decision as if now. I was hoping you could help me with that
30/1/24, 12:48 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Thats means at loacl university in Zimbabwe  $600*2 semester $1200 per year for tution fees $200 per year for internship 

$70 a month rent * 12 months = $840 a year for accommodation

Basic 3 meal sadza a day $1 per meal *3 meals a day *365 days = $1095 

Data bundles - $ 50 a month right * 12 months = $600 

Misc- $300 

Total at UZ = Exceeds $4100

Have you calculated this ?
Where as at Edoofa at top universities abroad you are only paying $2000-$3000 also complementary you are getting EWYL program to self finance the fees so which one is affordable ? <This message was edited>
30/1/24, 1:07 PM - +263 78 489 1629: I think Indian education is very affordable 💯, but the main issue is, I believe I pointed it out in my previous message, if you could help me with that please..
30/1/24, 1:42 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: I understand that you are interested in this golden opportunity to study in India under the given Scholarship. I do realize that your Family Members may have other concerns and this is the reason I have requested our Program Director Mr. Abhinav to spare some time to talk to your Parents about this. Shall I share the schedule with you?
30/1/24, 3:35 PM - +263 78 489 1629: Yes please

31/1/24, 9:14 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: You may have received misinformation, as we exclusively collaborate with top universities that hold international accreditation and global rankings. These institutions are governed by the University Grants Commission (UGC), a governmental body that regulates the quality of education abroad. This is why India stands out as a dream destination for students from 121 countries.
We at Edoofa have strong selection criteria  for Universities to come in our list .
