I'm sure you and your family have discussed this thoroughly. What decisions have you made for your future? Considering the cost and employment opportunities, have you compared the benefits of studying in India with the Edoofa program against other options?
31/1/24, 10:53 AM - +263 77 409 5774: We have also managed to look at the fees and above all employment opportunities is also key.kindly confirm how the Edoofa program works.if she studies in India is she able to look for a job and work there as well
31/1/24, 10:55 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Please understand that the Edoofa Scholarship is a work study program. We are preparing students throughout the course and through the Earn While You Learn Program so that they gain employability skills and get transformed into employable and professionals of the era! They will be working on different platforms which will enhance their communication, leadership, team management and other professional skills.  Once they complete they are already having hands-on experience on various projects and real-life situations and it would be much easier for them to be employable and receive jobs internationally as our degrees are globally accredited.
31/1/24, 10:56 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: It is important to know the facts of Edoofa's guidance and uniqueness compared to the normal University approach.

1) *Personalized mentorship and guidance throughout your course:-* As your Career Counsellor, I have known you since the beginning of the process, understanding your interests, aspirations, family background and plans for your career, unlike a University officer who may come across your application for the first time and treats with the same importance like others. I personally understand where you come from and what is required for you to be successful.

Students are ensured to open Indian bank accounts so that parents can even deposit the fees in monthly installments.

1/2/24, 8:58 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Good morning!
I hope you're well. I sincerely apologize for the delay yesterday; I was engaged in a meeting. Thank you for your patience. As we resume our discussion, I'm reminded of Proverbs 16:3 (NIV): *"Commit to the Lord whatever you do, and he will establish your plans."* Shall we proceed with our decision now?
1/2/24, 10:26 AM - +263 71 479 0924: Good morning sir
I am a proud edoofian.
We can proceed with the session.
1/2/24, 1:26 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Can you please answer this ?
1/2/24, 1:56 PM - +263 71 479 0924: Yes , yes i am .
1/2/24, 3:02 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Perfect, To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is BA TRAVEL AND TOURISM and your intake is in August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information is accurate?
1/2/24, 5:18 PM - +263 71 479 0924: Yes it is
1/2/24, 9:26 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
2/2/24, 9:22 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Good morning! let's draw inspiration from the timeless wisdom found in the Bible:

*Proverbs 9:9 (NIV):*
*"Instruct the wise and they will be wiser still; teach the righteous and they will add to their learning."*

Let's continue our interactive session and embrace the transformative power of education.
2/2/24, 9:46 AM - +263 71 479 0924: Greetings. We may continue
2/2/24, 9:52 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: As I have promised, the Edoofa Admissions team will be submitting your application to multiple universities that will evaluate your application and upon being eligible, you receive the offer letters with comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. *I will guide you to the best education institution/university associated with us that aligns with your vision and interest and would provide you with a conducive environment for your holistic development and to fulfil your career goals.*

Upon receiving the Offer Letter, you will have a few weeks to pay a portion of your university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. We discussed the registration fee during our counselling sessions. May I know, what do you recall about the same now?
2/2/24, 10:03 AM - +263 71 479 0924: It's $1000
2/2/24, 10:03 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Let me help you with a better understanding. *Usually, the registration fee is an additional fee apart from the cost of education but Edoofians receive an exclusive benefit where it is a part of the cost of education itself.* Let me give you an example:-
2/2/24, 10:04 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: As we discussed in the counselling session, the cost of education in India ranges from $6000-$8000 per annum which is reduced to $2000-$3000 per annum through the Edoofa Scholarship Program which includes the registration fee, remaining tuition fees, Accommodation, Food, Wifi, Laundry, library fee etc. Now, let us assume,

1. *Tuition Fee*: $1800 per annum
2. *Food and Accommodation Fee*: $1000 per annum 
Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum
3. *Registration Fee to be paid:* $1000
2/2/24, 10:04 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: This means this registration fee that you pay will be subtracted from the cost of education ($2800-$1000= $1800) and the remaining fee of $1800 can be paid in two installments. The first part of $900 within 3 days after your arrival here in India and the remaining $900 will be due in December 2024, or before your second semester begins.

*Do you have any questions for me regarding the same?*
2/2/24, 10:11 AM - +263 71 479 0924: No I do not have sir
2/2/24, 10:41 AM - +263 77 409 5774: Good morning I am a proud edoofian. When does the first semester start
2/2/24, 11:16 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: I want you to share the following documents with us as they are required for your university application preparation:

*1. A-Level Result/Letter of Recommendation/Statement of Entry (A-Level).*

*2. O-Level Results*

*3. Identity proof (International Traveling Passport or National ID or Birth Certificate)*
2/2/24, 11:17 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: July august
2/2/24, 11:17 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: The registration fee can be paid either in two equal parts(The first half within 15 days and the second half within 30 days) or in one go itself.

Are you clear with the details?
2/2/24, 11:25 AM - +263 71 479 0924: Noted
2/2/24, 11:26 AM - +263 71 479 0924: Yes it's clear
2/2/24, 3:02 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: By when can you share this ?

3/2/24, 9:10 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: With this, we can proceed to step 4 of the admission cycle, i.e., Offer Letter from University/College. The universities will take three to five days to evaluate your application, after which, if they accept your application for a scholarship, they will send you a scholarship offer letter. In the offer letter, the scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee will be mentioned.

On this note, let us conclude our conversation for today. I will reach out to you once we get an update from the universities. Wish you a blessed day ahead, and please extend our regards to your family as well.
3/2/24, 9:19 AM - +263 71 479 0924: May I please have the list of the potential universities that u have applied to for me sir.

26/2/24, 8:53 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: I understand that you're experiencing financial difficulties, but postponing your child's education isn't the best solution. Your financial situation may not improve significantly over time, especially with inflation on the rise. Instead of delaying education, consider breaking down the costs into manageable portions and starting with what you can afford now. Investing in education is crucial for empowering your family's future. Taking a gap year could potentially diminish your child's opportunities for securing good jobs down the line.
26/2/24, 10:31 AM - +263 77 409 5774: Good morning Sir.I truly understand.just trying to find a way out and commit will advise when all is in order.thank you for your concern and advise
