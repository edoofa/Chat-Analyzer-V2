8/1/24, 4:20 PM - +263 71 590 5125: Greetings Ms. Siddhi Singh and all the Edoofa Program leadership. Hope you're doing great.  Thank you for being in touch.

It was a good experience and I enjoyed being part of the Edoofa family. On a sad note I am no longer able to continue with my programme reason being I am joining my cousin sister in Dubai. She has arranged something for me so l will be living Zim next year end of January 2024. It was nice interacting with you I have learnt a lot, you are such lovely people. Me and my family have enjoyed every session and all the magazines from the head of Edoofa Programme they were motivational, eye opening and they gave a wider picture of what i should be in life. Pass my regards to all those who were with me in this journey of becoming a proud Edoofian as we were all looking forward to that. May you continue with the good caring lovely spirit even to the new Edoofians to come. Have a lovely day. Thank you
9/1/24, 9:05 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad that you have had such an enriching experience with Edoofa up until now. I will surely convey your regards to everyone in the team.

If I may ask, what are your plans ahead after moving to Dubai with your cousin sister?
9/1/24, 1:38 PM - +263 71 590 5125: Good day Ms Siddhi. Thank you for the good remarks.

Initially at 16 my passion was to study Culinary Arts. I wished to join Culinary Arts shool by then but I felt I needed to grow whilst at high school because I felt I was too young to live my parents for Dubai because even by then i had an opportunity to go to Dubai to study Culinary  Arts. When I went  for my A level that's when l grew an interest in studying Sociology though deep down my heart l new my interest was in Culinary arts. In December my mum took me for psych tests and the results revealed that most careers suitable for me where to do with food, for example a baker, chef and so forth. Finally that's when I decided to go for Culinary Arts which I felt I was more into as compared to Sociology. However Sociology is something I can still pursue later in life, as far as I can remember quotes and teachings I learnt from magazine wrote by CEO and Director Angad Singh  have taught me that the sky is the limit when it comes to studying and that one can also search for  other skills found in them and can still pursue with them. So my greatest remarks goes to him and the whole team. You really made me discover myself. Job well done keep on keep promoting youngsters with their studies. Many thanks once again in our shona language we say "Tatenda". That is to say thank you for your time and concern about my future studies.
11/1/24, 8:24 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good morning, Blessing. Thank you for sharing your plans in so much detail with me. I will most definitely convey your thanks and regards to the whole team. It is a pleasure for us to be providing you with such learnings. I completely understand now, and if I was in your position I would have done the same. 

However, as your admission officer, I wanted to bring to your attention that India offers Culinary Arts as a major as well. 
Studying culinary arts in India offers a distinct advantage over Dubai as it provides a rich tapestry of culinary traditions, exposure to diverse regional cuisines, and opportunities for hands-on learning in a culturally vibrant setting. The immersive experience in India's culinary landscape enhances skill development and cultural understanding, making it an enriching choice for aspiring culinary professionals.
11/1/24, 8:24 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I would like to ask if you have finalized on the choice of your institution to pursue Culinary Arts?
11/1/24, 8:49 AM - +263 71 590 5125: That's great news.
11/1/24, 8:53 AM - +263 71 590 5125: Yes, I have already got an institution to pursue my studies in Culinary Arts. As India do you have job opportunities for example working whilst doing my studies and also can I get a job and work permit after my graduation.
11/1/24, 1:28 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Yes, dear. If you choose to pursue your higher education in India, we can assist you in securing internship opportunities to enhance your skills during your undergraduate studies. Upon graduation in India, you become eligible for a work visa and can commence your career here. Many individuals worldwide opt to study Culinary Arts in India, leveraging the diverse opportunities to specialize and build their careers. Would you like more information on this, dear?
15/1/24, 5:01 AM - +263 71 590 5125: Greetings Ms Siddhi, kindly share more information on Culinary Arts in India
