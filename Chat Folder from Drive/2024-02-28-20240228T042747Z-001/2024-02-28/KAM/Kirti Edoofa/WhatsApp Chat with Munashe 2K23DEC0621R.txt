Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion for you and your family, and I can only imagine the excitement that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival. <This message was edited>
16/1/24, 1:37 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you have the letter in your possession, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you've had the chance to go through the offer letter thoroughly? 

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
16/1/24, 1:40 PM - +263 78 307 6096: Thank you once again Ms Kirti for the congratulatory message.It is indeed a great achievement and something that I was waiting for in a while .
16/1/24, 1:42 PM - +263 78 307 6096: I had the chance to go through the letter and was looking forward to this discussion .
16/1/24, 1:43 PM - +263 77 459 4818: Good morning Admission Officer. Thank you for presenting the offer letter to Munashe. Yes it was indeed a great moment for the family. We were really looking forward to this great occasion.
Thank  you very much for the undoubted effort.
16/1/24, 1:46 PM - +263 77 459 4818: We are now eagerly waiting for the discussion to hear more about the processes to follow. Thank you
16/1/24, 1:47 PM - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome and thank you for your kind words. I am glad to hear that. As we proceed with today's discussion, we will get into the details of this specific offer letter. I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.
16/1/24, 1:47 PM - Kirti Edoofa: The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
16/1/24, 1:50 PM - +263 78 307 6096: This approach is good and of course we can look forward to the discussion.
16/1/24, 1:54 PM - +263 77 459 4818: Thank you much for the clarification. Now we are in the discussion mood.
16/1/24, 1:54 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you have gone through your offer letter from Lovely Professional University, I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with any queries you have. For us to begin our conversation, I want you to look at the letter again and tell me the following so that I know you have read it well -

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission Processing Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4. What’s the Registration fee?
16/1/24, 2:17 PM - +263 78 307 6096: Answering to question 1:The tuition fee per semester after the scholarship is $975 
2:The Standard Duration of the course is 3 years (6 semesters)
3:The Admission Processing fee is $200
4:The registration fee is $700
16/1/24, 2:18 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Yes, that is correct. As you can see in your offer letter, your course is a 3-year-long course, and each year is divided into 2 semesters, this means that you will have 6 semesters in your degree.*

After the scholarship, your per semester tuition fee is $975 making your per annum tuition fee ($975*2) = $1950. Is that clear?
16/1/24, 2:21 PM - +263 78 307 6096: Yes Ms Kirti ,I am following.
16/1/24, 2:21 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now, Let me also brief you on the two categories of accommodation that are available at LPU -

*1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels inside LPU have different categories. Standard Room with Air Cooler and Standard Room with Air Conditioner with a different number of seaters, the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want.

The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a standard four-seater air cooler room is $1125 and the per annum standard mess/food service fee is $550 and this increases with the type of room/meal plan you choose.
16/1/24, 2:21 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

We also have many students in India who have opted for accommodation outside the LPU campus considering it is more affordable, the cost will be around $1000 per annum and that includes Rent, Food, Wifi Service, and other basic amenities such as water and electricity bills.

The outside accommodations are safe. Students have an option to cook for themselves, along with that they find a community of Edoofians from Africa who are already studying at the same university as them.
16/1/24, 2:27 PM - +263 78 307 6096: I get what you are saying Ms.Kirti .
16/1/24, 2:29 PM - Kirti Edoofa: If you decide to stay on campus, the university officials will help you settle and will be taking responsibility for your well-being, our per annum accommodation cost will be $1675.

However, if a student doesn’t wish to stay on campus and is looking for more affordable accommodation options, in that case, they can go with the off-campus accommodation where their per annum cost would be around $1000 including the food cost and they can also cook food for themselves.
16/1/24, 2:29 PM - Kirti Edoofa: For the off-campus accommodation, you can connect with any of the Edoofians staying off-campus, and he/she would help you look for the off-campus accommodation options. If you are not connected with any students, we will help you connect with them near your time of arrival so that they can help you with the off-campus accommodation options.

*LPU never forces anyone to choose the Hostel, they ask them to visit the campus, check for themselves, and then decide whether he/she wants to stay inside or outside the campus. Are you clear on this?*
16/1/24, 2:34 PM - +263 78 307 6096: Yes Ms Kirti,it is clear
16/1/24, 2:39 PM - Kirti Edoofa: You also have the examination fee of $75 which is due every semester, and the health insurance fee. A Medical Health Insurance policy is mandatory for all international students and they can get it from the university itself and it would cost them $50 per annum subject to yearly revision.

If God forbids and something happens to you during your higher education, you would be protected from the financial risks or uncertainties that arise due to a medical emergency. I hope you are clear about this?
16/1/24, 2:41 PM - +263 78 307 6096: I am clear with that too ,I am following.
16/1/24, 2:47 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $700 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on January 29th, 2024*. I hope we are together so far?
16/1/24, 2:48 PM - +263 78 307 6096: I am following and we are moving together ...we are on the same page
16/1/24, 2:54 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $100 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
16/1/24, 2:55 PM - +263 78 307 6096: Yes Ms Kirti that would be great and more understandable.
16/1/24, 2:56 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $100 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $600 of the registration fee. This $600 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$300 before the first deadline date of January 29, 2024* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$300 before the second deadline date of February 29, 2024* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
16/1/24, 2:57 PM - Kirti Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $600 within 15 working days, before january  29, 2024. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
16/1/24, 2:59 PM - +263 78 307 6096: Yes Ms .Kirti thank you for the further explanation
16/1/24, 3:01 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
16/1/24, 3:01 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
16/1/24, 3:02 PM - +263 78 307 6096: Yes Ms.Kirti.I reside in Harare
16/1/24, 3:03 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
16/1/24, 3:03 PM - Kirti Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
16/1/24, 3:03 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
16/1/24, 3:05 PM - +263 78 307 6096: Okay Ms.Saloni I understand and we will be following the procedure.
16/1/24, 3:08 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @263783076096 I am sorry I did not understand you well here?
16/1/24, 3:11 PM - +263 78 307 6096: Above,I  was letting you know that we are on the same page and we will get in touch with Mr. Rajan for the payment procedures .
16/1/24, 3:12 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that. Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
16/1/24, 3:12 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Shorwi's FBC Bank for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
16/1/24, 3:14 PM - +263 78 307 6096: Thank you for your concern but we still have Mr Shorwi's banking details so it may not be necessary.
16/1/24, 3:16 PM - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome, let me share them just in case if you need to verify the details again.

Bank Name: FBC
Branch: Mutare
Account Holder Name: Kawadza Shorwi
Account Number: 5333 0380 0918 0214
Contact Number: +263 77 364 0738
16/1/24, 3:17 PM - +263 78 307 6096: It is okay Ms.Kirti.Thank you once again.
16/1/24, 3:18 PM - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. Now that you know your per annum educational expenses for your education abroad, let me also help you understand how you can make your education more affordable.

Ideally, the complete per annum fee is to be paid by the student, however, for students under the Edoofa Program, they have an additional opportunity of the EWYL Program. Because of that, you as a student can earn $800 to $1200 worth of scholarship credits in a year and use them to pay a part of your fee.
16/1/24, 3:18 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I would also like to inform you that the above range shared does not mean that a student can earn credits only up to $1200. There is no upper limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits.

In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his or her higher education, he/she can earn accordingly. Are you clear on this?
16/1/24, 3:21 PM - +263 78 307 6096: Yes Ms.Kirti I understand.
16/1/24, 3:22 PM - +263 78 307 6096: I would like to ask that does my scholarship credits pay up to the accommodation fees and other expenses or only the tuition fees?
16/1/24, 3:36 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for your concern let me help you understand. After you use your credits for your tuition fee once it is fully deposited and if you have any more credits left then you can certainly use them for your accommodation as well, but first preference should always be the tuition fee. I hope you are clear now?
16/1/24, 3:38 PM - +263 78 307 6096: Yes I am now clear and thank you for making me understand.I appreciate it.
16/1/24, 3:40 PM - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. Now, do you have any queries that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
16/1/24, 3:41 PM - +263 78 307 6096: No I am satisfied with all the explanations so far.You may continue.
16/1/24, 3:42 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am  glad to hear that. Let me also share a few insights into the university with you -
16/1/24, 3:42 PM - Kirti Edoofa: LPU is one of the best universities in India and it has been ranked in the top 80 universities worldwide, because of its international tie-ups, the exposure a student gets at the university is indomitable. 

It has a campus of 800 acres, with over 100,000 students studying from all over the world. Students from LPU are placed at Microsoft, Google, IMF, Work Bank, and many more. It has spent a lot of money building the infrastructure so that a quality service can be given to the students.

This will enable us to have a comprehensive discussion during our next scheduled meeting which will be on Friday that is 19th of January. We can address any queries you may have and outline the next steps for your admission process. I hope this sounds good to you?
16/1/24, 3:50 PM - +263 78 307 6096: Absolutely great and I am looking forward to our next discussion.
24/1/24, 4:45 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Munashe,

I hope this message finds you all well and in high spirits. I apologize for not being in touch over the past few days. Unfortunately, I was dealing with a significant ENT infection and needed to follow my doctor's recommendation for rest, which meant taking some time off to prioritize my health. As a result, I was unable to inform you about my temporary absence. Thankfully, I'm feeling considerably better now and am ready to resume our interactions. Before we proceed with our discussion, I'd like to catch up - how have you and your family been lately?
26/1/24, 2:37 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon parents and Munashe,

With that in mind, I'm reaching out again to see if you had the opportunity to go through my previous message and to ascertain if we are still connected with each other?

As you explore this opportunity further, I am sure that you are committed to completing the registration process and securing the scholarship seat. To help you get insights into how your life will be in India and the opportunities that you will have through Edoofa here, let me help you connect with one of our students - Valerie Rukobo.

Following her undergraduate studies, Valerie gained valuable work experience in India for a year before deciding to pursue her master's degree, also through the Edoofa Program. Her journey and experiences are a testament to the opportunities and support that the Edoofa Program offers. 

If you wish, you can contact Valerie to learn more about her experiences and insights regarding the program. Additionally, you could request her to share her Offer Letter, showcasing the professional opportunities she secured through Edoofa.
26/1/24, 4:57 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Valerie's father, a retired Police Officer in Zimbabwe, can also provide valuable insights into his daughter's experiences and the impact of the Edoofa Program on her education and career development in India. Feel free to reach out to them for a more comprehensive understanding of the program's benefits and outcomes.

26/1/24, 5:05 PM - +263 78 307 6096: That is nice of you Ms.Kirti,thank you.My parents are trying to make ends meet so that they meet the deadline for the payment and we are looking forward to meeting the dates and securing the scholarship seat.
26/1/24, 5:06 PM - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. Moving forward, I would like to discuss your plans for securing your scholarship seat so that we can communicate them with the university. 

As the university has set a deadline of 29 January 2024, for completing the registration process, you have two options to choose from. You can either make an initial payment of $300, or you can opt to pay the full $600 in one installment to expedite your admission process. Have you had an opportunity to consider which payment plan would be most suitable for you?
26/1/24, 5:09 PM - +263 78 307 6096: Yes Ms.Kirti we had discussed about the payment strategy.Due to the financial difficulties in Zimbabwe ,we had opted for the first payment method of making an initial amount of $300 .
26/1/24, 5:15 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know of this. In addition to this, it would be great if you could kindly provide me with the specific date you have in mind for the payment and the mode of payment that you are planning to use so that I can share those as well with the university.

31/1/24, 4:46 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good Afternoon, Parents and Munashe,

I hope you are doing well, and I find you in the best of sports. I was going through your scholarship application file today and I noticed that you are supposed to make the payment of your first part of the university registration fee of $300 by 29th of January 2024.

Considering the same, I wanted to reach out to you, share a gentle reminder, and try to understand if you have been able to make the payment of your fee by now so that we can update the academic board and the university officials accordingly?
31/1/24, 5:20 PM - +263 78 307 6096: Good afternoon Ms .Kirti,well I had to share with you that we did pay for the first installment of $300 on the 29th of January 2024
31/1/24, 5:27 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you were able to make the payment of your fee, @263783076096. Could you please share the payment receipt with us? This will allow us to update the accounts team and the university officials accordingly.
31/1/24, 5:27 PM - +263 78 307 6096: <Media omitted>
31/1/24, 5:28 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the payment receipt for your university registration fee, we have duly noted it and I have shared it with the accounts team as well for payment confirmation.

Once the payment is verified, we will update your scholarship application accordingly. Additionally, we will notify the university authorities about the payment for their records to ensure a smooth visa process.
31/1/24, 5:28 PM - Kirti Edoofa: However, I noticed that you made a payment of $300 instead of $337. It seems you are yet to make the payment of the balance amount of $37 for the International Transfer Charges?
31/1/24, 5:34 PM - +263 78 307 6096: I think there is a misunderstanding Ms .Kirti,On the receipt above it shows that I paid a total amount of $338 on the transaction amount that is including the international charges.I will share the deposit slip for verification sake.
