28/12/23, 8:09 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Malvern.

I hope you are doing well. I am *Ms. Kirti, Admission Officer at Edoofa*. It has been a long time since we connected, and I would like to check in with you and your family. How are you all doing today and how was your Christmas celebration?
28/12/23, 8:20 PM - +263 77 756 9307: I am better. However i spent christmas in hospital and am now expecting to be discharged next week anyday. The process took longer than i anticipated. Otherwise everyone else is ok.
28/12/23, 8:26 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I'm pleased to learn that you'll be discharged next week. How are you feeling currently? Are your hip bone, leg, and arm, which were fractured, healing well?
28/12/23, 8:32 PM - +263 77 756 9307: I am doing very well right now. Only that over the holidays the doctors were busy with emergency situations from holiday accidents. Otherwise i am feeling ok now.
28/12/23, 9:26 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that you are feeling well now. Let us reconnect tomorrow as it is past my available hours, and it has been a long day for me. So let us reconnect tomorrow I hope you will be available. Have a blessed night.
10/1/24, 6:52 PM - +263 77 756 9307: Greetings. I am now ok and was discharged today. Thank God. However i have lost working time and all resources were being channeled to my medication. May you talk with LPU so that they may extend my payment period to between end of january to mid february. I would really appreciate.
13/1/24, 11:28 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Malvern.

I hope you are doing well. I have taken into consideration what you mentioned above. I would love to continue with our discussions however, I regret to inform you that I'm currently not feeling well. As a result, I just came to inform you that I would like to reschedule our discussion for Monday. I hope this works for you and that you'll be available to connect on Monday. Thank you for your understanding.
13/1/24, 11:33 AM - +263 77 756 9307: Ok hope you will get well soon. Yes i am available on monday, and its ok if i may know what time.
13/1/24, 11:34 AM - +263 77 756 9307: My son got his results and did very well. He got Maths (A); Computer Science (A) and Physics (B)
13/1/24, 11:34 AM - +263 77 756 9307: <Media omitted>
13/1/24, 11:34 AM - Kirti Edoofa: @263777569307 I shall let you know about the same since my first half will be occupied with meetings hence we would be connecting probably after 06:00 pm.
13/1/24, 11:35 AM - +263 77 756 9307: Ok noted
13/1/24, 11:35 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your results, and congratulations on successfully clearing all your A-Level subjects! Your hard work over the past few months has truly paid off.

I'm sure your family is immensely proud of your achievements. Your A-level results have been duly noted, and we will promptly add them to your scholarship application. This will enable us to engage in discussions with the academic board and chart the best course of action for your next steps.
13/1/24, 11:35 AM - +263 77 756 9307: Its ok thanks
13/1/24, 11:37 AM - +263 77 756 9307: Just a reminder, i had invoice of $275 due to be paid. Can i go ahead and pay or i wait for your communication on monday
13/1/24, 11:40 AM - Kirti Edoofa: @263777569307 You can go ahead with the payment, I have already discussed your case with the team and you share the receipt with us
13/1/24, 11:46 AM - +263 77 756 9307: Its ok i will do that on monday afternoon before our session
14/1/24, 3:32 PM - +263 77 756 9307: The fees per semester is $1475. This $550 i am paying this month, shall it add towards the fees , so that i then pay balance from $1475, or its separate amount.
15/1/24, 9:04 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning parents and Malvern.

I hope you are doing well. Thank you for your query, let me help you understand. This fee of $550 is to be paid by the student/parent to reserve their scholarship seat with the university and it is not an additional cost, it is part of your first-year tuition fee which is paid while you are in your home country and it will be adjusted against your first year cost of education hence making your registration fee as zero.

I hope we are clear here?
15/1/24, 9:04 AM - +263 77 756 9307: Yes very clear
15/1/24, 9:07 AM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that, may I know if you have any update to share regarding the payment since you mentioned on Saturday that you will be making the last deposit of Malvern's registration fee today?
15/1/24, 9:09 AM - +263 77 756 9307: I said i shall do the deposit after our communication which you mentioned. Since i shared his results, you said you shall deliberate on the issue and inform me on new way forward. So am waiting for that communication.
15/1/24, 9:10 AM - +263 77 756 9307: Regarding payment i said i will pay the current $275 whose invoice i have, then you then supply another invoice of remaining $275 which i shall pay next week.
15/1/24, 12:18 PM - +263 77 756 9307: May you prepare another invoice for $275 please.
15/1/24, 12:21 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that, may I know by when are you willing to make the deposit so that I can request for the invoice accordingly?
15/1/24, 12:22 PM - +263 77 756 9307: First invoice for $275 will be paid by thursday. And then last invoice for $275 will be paid by sartuday
15/1/24, 12:26 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that, please correct me if I understood you wrong here so you are saying you will be depositing $275 on Thursday that is 18th of January, and the last part of $275 on the 20th of January 2024. May I know if my understanding here is correct?
15/1/24, 12:26 PM - +263 77 756 9307: Yes you are right
15/1/24, 12:30 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that, in that case, we would be able to share the invoice of the payments today with you however, please note that if you do not meet the deadlines this time the university will have to let go of your endowment benefits because those benefits were offered to you in October and now we are January and the university has to be fair to all the students as well.
15/1/24, 12:30 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Also for the invoice please share the email address.
15/1/24, 12:40 PM - +263 77 756 9307: Mchikuhwa@yahoo.com
15/1/24, 12:40 PM - +263 77 756 9307: This i understand
15/1/24, 12:49 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the email address, I shall get back to you shortly with your invoice.
15/1/24, 12:49 PM - +263 77 756 9307: Noted. Thanks

17/1/24, 11:53 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Malvern.

I hope you are doing well. Thank you for sharing that, I am sharing a link with you, please log in to your PayPal account here, and add your debit card to your account, once your card is added, you will be able to make the payment, within 24 hours. 

https://www.paypal.com/signin?returnUri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.paypal.com%2Fmyaccount%2Fmoney&state=%2F
17/1/24, 11:53 AM - +263 77 756 9307: Thank you. Let me do that.
17/1/24, 11:55 AM - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome.
17/1/24, 11:56 AM - +263 77 756 9307: The problem i am encountering is, to complete logging in, they want to verify my phone, and the code to verify that is not even coming despite several attempts on resend. So what should i do
17/1/24, 12:01 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know if you are finding a challenge here. What you can do is make the payment using your Card, then, the transfer charges through this mode are at 10%.

1. Direct Payment through Edoofa's Website (Available at www.edoofa.com)
17/1/24, 12:01 PM - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
17/1/24, 12:04 PM - +263 77 756 9307: In zimbabwe your Edoofa page does not have option for making payments. I tried this option last year and could not succeed because here your website does not show pay option. So what can i do.
17/1/24, 12:07 PM - +263 77 756 9307: And my visa card already appears on my Paypal account
17/1/24, 12:26 PM - +263 77 756 9307: Or else may you create invoices in batches of $250 please.
17/1/24, 2:42 PM - +263 77 756 9307: I have phoned Shorwi Kawadza your local Edoofa representative in Zimbabwe. He said the issue is to break the invoices into $250, then i will be able to make the payment.
17/1/24, 3:06 PM - +263 77 756 9307: Of the $550, i have to pay, may you create invoices of $250 maximum please so that i will be able to pay by penpal. It means i need three invoices ( 2 x $250) and 1 x $50 .
17/1/24, 4:28 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that we can certainly do that, however, the limit is on your PayPal account, if your number is not getting verified I would like you to log in with your email account through the link I shared above.
17/1/24, 4:29 PM - +263 77 756 9307: I have already done that. They shall send a code, that will remove limits on my account
17/1/24, 4:31 PM - +263 77 756 9307: So whilst waiting for my limit to be increased, you may give me 3 invoices as i have requested so that i make my first payment even today. Because i shall receive the code in 3 to 4 working days.
17/1/24, 4:31 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That is good to know, let me know if you face any other challenges.
17/1/24, 4:31 PM - +263 77 756 9307: Its ok, for now i am.now waiting for 3 invoices from you.
17/1/24, 4:32 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I have requested them from the accounts team, once I received them I shall share the same with you. <This message was edited>

18/1/24, 10:38 AM - +263 77 756 9307: I hv noted my payments did not go through. The money has been credited back into my account. So i will try again today.
18/1/24, 12:17 PM - +263 77 756 9307: Please i am having problems with paypal online payment. I have tried again, my account is being debited, but the payments are not going through. Is it possible to have a link and pay LPU direct.
19/1/24, 8:44 AM - +263 77 756 9307: Following hurdles i faced to make payments to you through Paypal and getting no way forward, and also losing some money in transaction charges, i resolved yesterday to withdraw the amount and pay somewhere as cash. 
So i am nolonger part of you. Thank you so much for the time we had been together.
19/1/24, 8:44 AM - +263 77 756 9307: You may delete this group accordingly.
19/1/24, 9:17 AM - Piiyush Edoofa: Good Morning @263777569307
19/1/24, 9:18 AM - Piiyush Edoofa: Can you please share with what exactly happened, since as I can see in the mail from Paypal, your account had insufficient balance to complete the formalities?
19/1/24, 9:19 AM - +263 77 756 9307: Dear Customer, You have successfully completed an online transaction of USD 250.00 at PAYPAL *ANHADEDUTRA, LU. Your new bank balance is USD 98.20
19/1/24, 9:20 AM - Piiyush Edoofa: Mr Mutsa, did you receive the receipt from Paypal after completing the same?
19/1/24, 9:20 AM - Piiyush Edoofa: Or you are just sharing the bank's debit message?
19/1/24, 9:21 AM - +263 77 756 9307: The payments did not go through and were being reversed,i dont know why. Thats why i had to reach out to admissions team for way forward
19/1/24, 9:23 AM - Piiyush Edoofa: Mr Mutsa, Did you try completing three transactions at once?
19/1/24, 9:23 AM - Piiyush Edoofa: On a same day please?
19/1/24, 9:23 AM - +263 77 756 9307: And unfortunately i could not get assistance from admissions team timeously; i understand maybe they were busy with other things. But because i was also losing money because each time i did these transactions i was incurring transactions charges.
19/1/24, 9:24 AM - +263 77 756 9307: I tried only 2, not 3. The $250 and $50. I was supposed to make another $250 on sartuday
19/1/24, 9:26 AM - +263 77 756 9307: I had credited my account with enough money to make those 2 transactions, $250 and $50. But none could not go through. I did not even know the problems with paypal.
19/1/24, 9:26 AM - Piiyush Edoofa: Mr Mutsa, I hope you recall that during Malvern's enrollment procedure as well, I shared with you that your account's daily limit from Paypal is of $250, after which you would have to wait for a day to make another payment and while you do that, your account should have a minimum balance of $10 after completing $250, do you recall the call we had while I was in Zimbabwe?
19/1/24, 9:27 AM - +263 77 756 9307: Piyush, but still the $250 payment could not go through, why. I think i have shared with you the bank message after trying to send first $250
19/1/24, 9:28 AM - Piiyush Edoofa: It is not a problem with Paypal @263777569307, I did share with you last time as well, let me help you once again, it is Zimbabwean Banking Law, where if a citizen has international banking done via multiple modes less than $5000 a month, their daily limit of international transactions is $250.
19/1/24, 9:28 AM - +263 77 756 9307: As you can see after trying to send $250, my balance was $98
19/1/24, 9:28 AM - Piiyush Edoofa: @263777569307, After $250, did you happen to immediately pay $50 as well?
19/1/24, 9:30 AM - +263 77 756 9307: Yes after seeing that $250 has not gone through, i tried lesser amount of $50 and neither did it go through
19/1/24, 9:33 AM - +263 77 756 9307: Remember i tried this on wednesday, and all my money was being reversed. I tried again yesterday, and got the same problem. But each time i was incurring transaction charges. 

I reached out to admissions team for way forward and got no response. Because time is going and universities are recruiting, i had no option other than to with draw my cash and make payment elsewhere
19/1/24, 9:34 AM - +263 77 756 9307: Remember i incurred the same problem last year with paypal when i wanted to send $110. First time the amount was reversed. I tried 2nd time and i succeeded.
19/1/24, 9:40 AM - Piiyush Edoofa: @263777569307 with all due respect Sir, firstly when you reached out to me asking to hold Malvern's process because you wanted to wait for the results, I shared with you that you should at least start the preliminary processes so that at the last moment you don't have to race against time. However last time if you recall I shared with you if you have the details, you can do an RTGS to any of the Edoofa's associates in Zimbabwe to complete the formalities of your child.
19/1/24, 9:40 AM - +263 77 756 9307: Piyush my bank allows international transactions of up to $5000 per day. I use my visa card to make online transactions for my orders from South Africa nearly every week, but I dont use Paypal for all these. I just pay direct. I also use it for all other payments like dstv and so on, but dont incur any hurdles.
19/1/24, 9:42 AM - Piiyush Edoofa: @263777569307 It is Zimbabwean Forex law that prohibits a lot of parents from making transactions, through Paypal.
19/1/24, 9:44 AM - Piiyush Edoofa: @263777569307 You completed the formalities, the same day immediately, Like I was sharing, you had to complete only one transaction of $250 and wait for a day, next day your account would be valid to complete another transaction in the first place.
19/1/24, 9:44 AM - +263 77 756 9307: I understand Piyush, but at the same time even my $250 payment could not go through, why. My daily limit is $250 with paypal, i agree, but even that $250 could not be processed: that is the problem.
19/1/24, 9:45 AM - Piiyush Edoofa: You paid $250 and $50's invoice together @263777569307 that is why please!
19/1/24, 9:45 AM - Piiyush Edoofa: Please see, you were supposed to only complete one invoice of $250, because your limit is of $250 a day.
19/1/24, 9:45 AM - +263 77 756 9307: Piyush i tried another transaction only after i had seen that one has been reversed.
19/1/24, 9:46 AM - Piiyush Edoofa: I believe you did both the transactions the same day because of which you shared the screenshot, the transaction got reversed the next day @263777569307 <This message was edited>
19/1/24, 9:48 AM - +263 77 756 9307: Piyush its same day yes, because i tried one transaction $250 first and it failed, but my bank had already debited it. Thats when i tried another.
19/1/24, 9:50 AM - +263 77 756 9307: After all paypal had told me to complete account verification formalities after which the $250 limit would be lifted. But to complete the formalities i needed a code sent on my phone. This code never came since when i tried on wednesday, it only came yesterday. Hence i am saying there are also problems at Paypal.
19/1/24, 9:52 AM - +263 77 756 9307: I even called Shorwi Kawadza on Wednesday explaining what was happening.
19/1/24, 9:53 AM - +263 77 756 9307: Anyway to cut a long story short, i had paid something to Edoofa, I think you may refund me all or part of it. I would be happy.
19/1/24, 9:54 AM - Piiyush Edoofa: @263777569307 Paypal's account verification in Zimbabwe takes a few days, which is why from the beginning it has been recommended that if you complete the formalities using Associates for the initial process it is easier for you while your Account verification is completed, you can use that for University payments of your child!
19/1/24, 9:58 AM - +263 77 756 9307: But remember Piyush to pay through your associates is expensive because a certain mark up is added again on that payment, thats why i had to opt for online transactions.
19/1/24, 10:01 AM - +263 77 756 9307: Paypal is problematic, remember i faced a similar hurdle last year when i sent $110. First time it was reversed, though its much less than daily limit of $250. It had to go through on 2nd attempt.
19/1/24, 10:05 AM - Piiyush Edoofa: @263777569307 if that was the challenge, why didn't you complete a direct Telegraphic Transfer from your account to India?
19/1/24, 10:06 AM - Piiyush Edoofa: The only difference would have been in the transfer charges @263777569307, on Paypal transfer charge is 10% after which 3% is deducted by Paypal as well from your account.

Whereas on payment to associates you have a direct transfer charge of 12.5% only.
19/1/24, 10:13 AM - +263 77 756 9307: Telegraphic transfer is even more expensive because my bank charges a minimum of $50 per transaction. I only do telegraphic transfers for amounts above $1000 in the event i cannot use my visa card.
19/1/24, 10:14 AM - Piiyush Edoofa: @263777569307 this is the effective transfer charge that a parent bears on both the modes, this is something which I did explain you while we were having a word in Zimbabwe as well, because of which you ended up completing the formalities to Mr Shorwi for the first part.
19/1/24, 10:15 AM - +263 77 756 9307: I love you so much and hope to engage you when my daughter currently in high school will be ready for university
19/1/24, 10:17 AM - +263 77 756 9307: Anyway may you reply to this one and map good way forward. Our relationship has been a good one from first time. I love you so much.
19/1/24, 10:22 AM - Piiyush Edoofa: @263777569307 while I do understand that you have faced challenges in completing the formalities, but tell me something how is paying someone else part of the solution, it is quite disheartening that at one place you are saying that you do acknowledge the fact that we have shared a good relation, you have called me for sharing even the slightest update of the Parent Teacher Meet of Malvern's school after Term 2, on the other hand when you faced these challenges, you didn't call me if you had that urgency?
19/1/24, 10:25 AM - +263 77 756 9307: But i wrote to you on same platform piyush, the message i had to delete after a day waiting.
19/1/24, 10:30 AM - +263 77 756 9307: As Edoofa team, i encourage you to answer to parents problems timeously, because where i then went to make my cash payment yesterday, i also met disgruntled parents sharing same sentiments about Edoofa. I understand you may be busy, but you may try to attend to messages within 24hrs. That would be fine , i think.
19/1/24, 10:39 AM - +263 77 756 9307: 👆i sent that message yesterday around 12 and waited for response, but got none.
19/1/24, 10:41 AM - Piiyush Edoofa: @263777569307 you shared a concern at 12pm CAT yesterday, I got back with a solution by 9am CAT today itself, isn't that addressing the concern within 24 hour window please?
19/1/24, 10:43 AM - +263 77 756 9307: This is but remember i had other messages on this platform which went for 3 days unattended.
19/1/24, 10:44 AM - Piiyush Edoofa: @263777569307 Team Edoofa is well aware of such challenges because from Day 1 it is communicated to the parents to make decisions in a timely fashion, but when they don't and then towards the end try to rush everything, how do you expect that to be addressed with same weightage?
19/1/24, 10:46 AM - +263 77 756 9307: No its not a matter of rushing things, its simple communicating my dear. If my message is replied to within 24hrs, no problem about that. Remember i also respond to your messages and of others instantly. Thats why i am always online.
19/1/24, 10:47 AM - Piiyush Edoofa: I believe when I say this I am a bit familiar with you as a person as well @263777569307, and while I know you do tend to rush at the last moment, I have full faith in you that you don't take an uninformed decision, so while you want me to believe that you have completed formalities to someone else that too in cash, it is a bit challenging for me to believe the same considering I know that by far you are one of the most aware parents of how is the journey of an Edoofian as compared to any other student's journey with an Admission Agent.
19/1/24, 10:58 AM - +263 77 756 9307: Remember Piyush i dont know much about Edoofa apart from what i learnt from you. I was waiting for my son to come to India and experience life as an Edoofian and gain first hand experience.

And remember also when had that interview with me, you told me about EWYL program and did not go into detail what it involves when my son is engaged whilst still in Zimbabwe. I only learnt how it is when my son was told to visit schools, engage other students and share application platforms , only to be given credits of $2, $5, and $25. Honestly Piyush i was not happy about this part. You have to Zimbabwe yourself. Travelling is a bit expensive and worse still getting such little amounts in appreciation did not amuse me.

And i correctly stated on this platform on EWYL group, this is one of the issues being taken advantage of by your competitors here by telling parents that Edoofa uses prospective students to sell or advertise their product.
19/1/24, 11:00 AM - +263 77 756 9307: But Piyush, what did you expect me to do. I had challenges on wednesday which i shared with you, and noone from your side came my rescue or advice. Yesterday i faced similar challenges again, so i could not continue on same subject because i also have other things to do.
19/1/24, 11:02 AM - +263 77 756 9307: Please may you conclude this discussion on way forward towards reembursing me. I notice you have not answered this question though i have put it to twice and this is the third time.
19/1/24, 11:10 AM - Piiyush Edoofa: @263777569307 I hope you are well aware of the refund condition that a refund is applicable only in the event if Edoofa fails to provide a student with admission under the program, if a parent or a student decides to drop out of the program refund would not be applicable.
19/1/24, 11:11 AM - +263 77 756 9307: Its ok, see you when i come to India this year.

13/2/24, 5:13 PM - +263 77 756 9307: Please note Malvern is nolonger with Edoofa
27/2/24, 2:31 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon, Parents and Malvern.

I trust you are in good health. I apologize for not reaching out earlier, as my family is currently facing a challenging situation with the passing of my grandfather. I have been occupied with the necessary rituals and, as a result, was unable to connect with you.
27/2/24, 2:34 PM - +263 77 756 9307: Ok sorry for that loss. Otherwise how are you.
27/2/24, 5:59 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I appreciate your kind words. Thank you for asking, I am doing fine. Thank you for your sympathy and support. It means a lot to my family and me. However, I am now available to connect with you now
27/2/24, 6:03 PM - +263 77 756 9307: No worries. Malvern has already enrolled using another agent. So we are nolonger with Edoofa.
27/2/24, 6:41 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that, may I know which university has he enrolled?
27/2/24, 7:23 PM - +263 77 756 9307: Parul
27/2/24, 7:45 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that.  I can understand that you wish to explore the alternatives you mentioned, specifically Parul University, however, let me inform you why we are not partnered with Parul University.
27/2/24, 7:45 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I understand that since you are not physically present here and since you have limited knowledge about the universities here in India, you do believe in the information that you get on the internet. But, since we have been in the Indian Education sector for more than a decade now, we do have strong connections with the education ministry and organizations all over India due to which we know all about the universities here in India.
27/2/24, 7:46 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now, let us first discuss about Parul University. Since you yourself have mentioned its name, I believe you were not aware of the fact that Parul University is not among the institutions listed in the National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) rankings, and due to the same reason any degree completed by the students at Parul University is not recognized. Were you aware of this?
27/2/24, 7:47 PM - +263 77 756 9307: Sorry , i did typing error. Its not Parul. He got at same LPU. Sorry for that typing error.
27/2/24, 7:49 PM - +263 77 756 9307: Parul offered him a place and we declined the offer, becoz we did not find it among India' s top universities
27/2/24, 7:51 PM - +263 77 756 9307: He had offers from Parul, RNTU as well as LPU. So we chose LPU.
27/2/24, 7:53 PM - +263 77 756 9307: Because Edoofa had been quiet for a while, whilst I needed answers; so since we had 2 offer letters from LPU, we had to go with the other offer letter. And officials from LPU came to Harare ; we met them and all questions were answered.
27/2/24, 7:54 PM - +263 77 756 9307: Piyush is aware of this development. Since i had paid some money to Edoofa, I asked for a refund and was told no refund. I said all is ok and moved on .
