I trust this message finds you in good health. In our recent conversation, you mentioned your plan to complete the payment by the 30th of December. Accordingly, I shared this update with the university officials.
29/12/23, 11:09 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Considering that this time of year is marked as the festive season, and banks may close earlier, the university officials recommended that you visit the bank either a day before or early on Saturday. This precautionary measure aims to ensure that you do not encounter unexpected challenges. By doing so, you will have a backup day, minimizing the risk of any issues and safeguarding your scholarship.
29/12/23, 11:09 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Once you make the payment for your fee, as you always do, please remember to share the payment receipt with us. This will enable us to confirm the payment in a timely manner.

I trust this message finds you well, and I hope you are in high spirits. In recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their A-Level results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey.
16/1/24, 2:12 PM - Ashi Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?
22/1/24, 5:20 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Monalisa ,

I trust this message finds you well and in high spirits. As I was organizing my day today, I took the opportunity to review your scholarship application file. I observed that the remaining amount of $286 for your university registration fee is due before January 30th, 2024. Consequently, I wanted to reach out to inquire about your preparations. 

How is your preparation going forward? Have you been able to raise the outstanding amount of $286 by now?
26/1/24, 7:22 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening, Parents and Monalisa!

I hope this message finds you and your family in good health and high spirits. I am *Ms. Kirti, Admission Officer at Edoofa*. I will be handling the next steps in your university admission journey and will be directing you in the right direction so that you can reap the most benefits from the Edoofa scholarship program.
26/1/24, 7:22 PM - Kirti Edoofa: As we step during the end of the month. With great excitement and pride, I also want to share that over the past few days, the Edoofa team has been immersed in an exciting event we had in store for our students. Edoofa hosted a conference - the Symposium of Leaders, Innovators, and Creators at Edoofa, also known as 'SLICE-CON.'
26/1/24, 7:22 PM - Kirti Edoofa: The conference was attended by all the Edoofians of 2023 and a few senior Edoofians from previous batches. It focused on the art of creation, innovation, and, most importantly, the mindset required to make an impact in one's career.
26/1/24, 7:23 PM - Kirti Edoofa: During this Industrial Visit and the conference - SLICE CON, Corporate leaders, such as the CEOs and Co-founders from renowned companies like Rage Coffee, Sirona Hygiene, Jolin New York, and more, shared their insights and experiences. These individuals are at the helm of multi-millionaire brands, leading large marketing teams. Their presence added immense value, providing students with the opportunity to engage in transformative conversations.
26/1/24, 7:23 PM - Kirti Edoofa: We believe that interactions with such industry leaders can bring significant transformations to students' lives, enhancing their business acumen. Our Edoofians maximized this opportunity, having life-changing conversations with these influential figures. The main objective of the event was to emphasize the importance of thinking outside the box, and encouraging students to believe in themselves and their dreams. Before we discuss your admission journey further, I wanted to share a glimpse of the event, and I hope you are excited to attend similar events when you come to India.
