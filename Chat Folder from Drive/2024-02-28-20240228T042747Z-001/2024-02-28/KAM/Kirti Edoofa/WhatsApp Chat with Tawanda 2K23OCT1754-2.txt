26/12/23, 7:44 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Tawanda,

I trust this message finds you in good health and that you had a delightful Christmas. Following up on our earlier discussion, I understand that you are scheduled to make a deposit on the 30th of December. I'm reaching out to check on your preparations and to ask if there are any updates or progress you'd like to share with us?
26/12/23, 9:42 PM - +263 77 963 3845: Good evening sir yes the deposit will be made before 30 December
26/12/23, 9:49 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that, I shall wait for an update from your end. Once you have made the payment, please share the receipt with me here.
28/12/23, 8:16 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Tawanda.

I hope you're doing well. I wanted to reach out again to check on the status of the payment, as tomorrow is your deadline and you shared that you will be making the deposit on the 30th however, the 30th being Saturday the banks might be closed. So I hope you take our recommendation and make the deposit a day before so that your deadline is not affected. It's important for us to provide an update to the university officials accordingly.

Your response would be greatly appreciated as it will help us stay on track with the university's requirements?
28/12/23, 8:37 PM - +263 71 429 2822: Greetings everyone l hope you are doing well
28/12/23, 8:37 PM - +263 71 429 2822: Mr Rajan Niger is not available at the moment he has travelled out of the city so he said he we will transfer the money on the 2nd of January
28/12/23, 8:46 PM - +263 71 429 2822: Oky the deposit will be made tomorrow morning
28/12/23, 9:17 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know, I understand that Mr. Rajan is not available, however, as your deadline is tomorrow you will need to make the deposit tomorrow only since your extension has already been approved by the university officials and they are aware of the same date. So may I know if you would like to explore other payment modes?
28/12/23, 9:45 PM - +263 71 429 2822: Oky mam the deposit will be made tomorrow through Ms shorwi account
28/12/23, 9:53 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, let me share Mr. Shorwi's detail's with you. 

Bank Name: FBC
Branch: Mutare
Account Holder Name: Kawadza Shorwi
Account Number: 5333 0380 0918 0214
Contact Number: +263 77 364 0738
28/12/23, 9:56 PM - +263 71 429 2822: Oky thank you mam
28/12/23, 10:42 PM - +27 65 128 7894: I'm sorry we are not using Mr shorwi account because of high charges we will be using payment thru rajan
28/12/23, 10:43 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright, let me share Mr. Rajan's mukuru details with you.

*Rajan Nayer*

Name: Rajan Nayer
Address: 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare
Contact Number: 0772460067
National ID Number: 63 1037566X00
28/12/23, 10:53 PM - +27 65 128 7894: Edoofa team is aware of my non availability so don’t worry pls as even if you come on 02/01 , I shall back date the receipt so be rest assured.
28/12/23, 10:53 PM - +27 65 128 7894: Oky
28/12/23, 10:57 PM - +27 65 128 7894: Hello kirt I needed to send my son at Mr Rajan place to reduce mukuru charges and transfer charges so I'm charting with rajan he is out at the moment but on the second of January he will be back in the morning
29/12/23, 1:04 AM - +263 77 963 3845: The payment is going to be done sir how are you
29/12/23, 1:13 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Tawanda. 

I hope you are doing well. Thank you for letting me know that, I shall wait for an update from your end.
29/12/23, 1:14 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I understand that Mr. Rajan may not be available, however, the transfer charges even if you use mukuru is still 7% @27651287894
29/12/23, 1:19 PM - +27 65 128 7894: I think you are not getting what I'm saying.If I use mukuru to transfer to Mr rajan it mukuru charges to do that transaction besides Mr rajan transfer fees.That will be a double charge
29/12/23, 1:21 PM - +27 65 128 7894: Mukuru is charging around 5 to 6 usd per 100usd so the student is having the money with him
29/12/23, 1:32 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, I fully understand your position, sir. If you prefer a different payment method, please feel free to inform me. However, it's important to recognize that the current deadline is an extended one, granted by the university officials and the academic board. Failing to meet this deadline could unfavorably affect Tawanda's scholarship application by conveying a lack of commitment to the offer, which is certainly not desirable.
29/12/23, 1:33 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I would suggest considering alternative payment options. Unfortunately, the university cannot grant further extensions beyond this already extended deadline. If you choose not to use Mr. Shorwi's account details, other available payment methods include Mama Money and bank transfers, both of which offer the convenience of 0% transfer charges.
29/12/23, 2:05 PM - +27 65 128 7894: Oky let tell him to use shorwi who is available ,you need to understand also we are using individuals not banks and this will end up showing as if we are not considering the issue of time extended
29/12/23, 2:07 PM - +27 65 128 7894: Remember we also need to look in these other abnormal transfer fees charged.
29/12/23, 2:20 PM - +27 65 128 7894: <Media omitted>
29/12/23, 2:27 PM - +27 65 128 7894: <Media omitted>
29/12/23, 2:58 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @27651287894 sir, I appreciate your perspective and it seems there might be some misunderstanding. Let me clarify the information I previously shared. The payment mode I mentioned, Mama Money, is specifically used in South Africa for global payments. Many of our students in South Africa have been utilizing it due to its zero international transfer fees. However, there is a 99 Rand transaction fee charged by the Mama Money app. You are welcome to verify this information independently for further assurance.
29/12/23, 2:58 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I recommended Mama Money initially because I noticed you were using a South African number. However, as you mentioned in your voice note that you're making the payment from Zimbabwe, Mama Money may not be the best option for you, as it's primarily accessible to those residing or working in South Africa.
29/12/23, 3:00 PM - Kirti Edoofa: When you talk about Zimbabwe just like you we have been working in the education sector for over 15 years and we are well aware of all the payment modes. You are absolutely right when you mentioned that no payment mode takes 0% transfer charges but that is only restricted when you are talking about Zimbabwe. For example, if you talk about India there are payment modes where people can transfer money without incurring any transfer charges but I do not think that is the case in Zimbabwe as well. For example, if you wish to make any bank transfer lets say to your friend in Zimbabwe you would have to incur a 2.5% transfer charge right, even if it is FBC bank but if you talk about India the transfer charge is 0% so the payment mode differs from country to country and the transfer charges as well.
29/12/23, 3:00 PM - Kirti Edoofa: The university's primary suggestion was a bank transfer, but if that doesn't suit your needs, other alternatives were proposed. One was to make the payment through Mr. Rajan. If connecting with Mr. Rajan proves difficult, you can use Mukuru, although this would include Mukuru's charges. Alternatively, if neither of these options is suitable, a payment through FBC might be the best route for you.
29/12/23, 3:01 PM - Kirti Edoofa: And that is what I have been trying to help you understand if you feel that our recommendation is not based on information  I believe sir you misunderstood my messages and hence I would like to please take a moment to go through my messages well we are only working for your application we understand the opportunity of higher education that you have right now you will not be able to get such options for Tawanda in the future and that is the reason I have been consistently helping your understand why it is important to complete the formalities before the deadline.
29/12/23, 3:08 PM - +27 65 128 7894: Oky I could see ,let me explain I'm not sending any money from here I have asked someone to give my son 320 usd and deposit like that ,as to wait for rajan to come back he will deposit that money in shorties account I want to try reduce the last payment
29/12/23, 4:40 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know, I understand that @27651287894 in that case, may I know if you would want me to share the account details for Mr. Shorwi with you again?
29/12/23, 4:45 PM - +27 65 128 7894: We have the account ,he will deposit it 320 tomorrow morning
29/12/23, 4:46 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, thank you for letting me know that. I shall wait for an update from your end. Once you have made the payment, please share the receipt with me here.
30/12/23, 11:06 AM - +263 71 429 2822: I have made the deposit l will send the proof in the next  1 hour

2/1/24, 12:57 PM - +263 71 429 2822: Noted sir
16/1/24, 1:20 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Proud Edoofians,

I trust this message finds you well, and I hope you are in high spirits. In recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their A-Level results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey.
16/1/24, 1:20 PM - Kirti Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?

I am sure your family is immensely proud of your achievements. Your A-level results have been duly noted, and we will quickly add them to your scholarship application. This will enable us to engage in discussions with the academic board and chart the best course of action for your next steps.
16/1/24, 2:00 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Kindly allow us some time to thoroughly evaluate your results and plan the way forward. Once we have re-evaluated your application, along with all the other applications, we will reconnect with you to discuss the next steps in your academic journey.
