20/2/24, 7:21 AM - +263 78 581 9582: Morning team . Thank you for hosting such a memorable event . Learnt a lot about Edoofa that l didn’t before how much of a big impact it is doing for many kids in Zimbabwe and africa as a whole.  The opportunity to meet the CEO of some of the big companies in India and be able to present  in front of them is in itself a blessing . 


 Am l disappointed with myself as l could have done more to be part of the organization team . I hope in the near future l can be able to participate  helping in any way l can .  The testimony of that guy who spent 6 years in India was really moving to see that he is now able to give back the knowledge he learnt to Zimbabwe it is something special . 

 Cant wait to start of my Education .  Than you team for such a whole sum experience. 


 Am a proud EDOOFIAN  and it is my blood . 

 Thank you
