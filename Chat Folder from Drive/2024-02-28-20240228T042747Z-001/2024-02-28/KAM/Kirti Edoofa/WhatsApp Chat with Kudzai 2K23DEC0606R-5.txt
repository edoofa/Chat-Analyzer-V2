6/1/24, 10:43 AM - +27 67 361 6520: Ok noted
6/1/24, 10:43 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from MVN University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
6/1/24, 10:43 AM - Kirti Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion -

1. What is your per annum tuition fee after the scholarship?
2. What is your per annum accommodation fee after the sponsorship?
3. What is you r annual fee at MVN University after the scholarship?
4. What are your  Sports and Misc. Fee (One-Time payable)
5. What is the Admission and Processing Fee to be paid to secure your scholarship seat?
6/1/24, 10:50 AM - +27 67 361 6520: Ok we are busy on it
6/1/24, 10:57 AM - Kirti Edoofa: I shall wait for your response.
6/1/24, 10:57 AM - +27 67 361 6520: Ok
6/1/24, 10:59 AM - +27 73 055 2749: Tuition fee is $350 per year after the scholarship 
Accommodation fee is $0 after the sponsorship 
My annual fee at MVN is $1600
My sports and Misc fee is $125 each
Admission and Processing fee is$575
6/1/24, 11:04 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for providing the details. As per the offer letter, MVN University has awarded a 90% scholarship on tuition fees, which means you don't have to pay any tuition fees throughout the course duration. This is a significant achievement and will greatly reduce the financial burden on your family.

Also, coming to the accommodation fees, as you can see in the letter, he has also been awarded a 100% waiver on the accommodation expenses, this means that the accommodation provided will be free of cost throughout the stay at MVN University. This is a fantastic opportunity as it further contributes to making education more affordable, isn’t it?
6/1/24, 11:05 AM - +27 67 361 6520: Yes
6/1/24, 11:06 AM - +27 73 055 2749: Yes
6/1/24, 11:47 AM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to see that. As you can see in the offer letter from MVN University, after the scholarship on the tuition and sponsorship fee on accommodation fee, the remaining per annum cost of education that you would have to pay is:

1. Tuition Fee: $350
2. Accommodation Fee: $0
3. University Infrastructure Fee: $575
4. International Student Development Fund: $300
5. Examination Fee (Per Year): $125
6. EDP & Book Bank Fee: $250
6/1/24, 11:47 AM - Kirti Edoofa: With this, if you sum up all the components, you will be able to see that your per annum cost of education is $1600.

At the same time, as you see in the offer letter, there are two components for the first year that are one-time payments, which are the Sports Fee and the Misc. Fee. This means the total expenses for the first year amount to $1600 (tuition) + $250 (fees) = $1850.

It is important to note that this cost is applicable for the first year only. From the second year onwards, your annual cost of education will be $1600. I hope this clarifies things in a better way for you?
6/1/24, 11:48 AM - +27 73 055 2749: Yes it does
6/1/24, 11:52 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Glad to hear that. If you have any questions on your mind or need further clarification, please feel free to bring them up. Also, now that you're aware of your per annum fee, let me share the list of facilities offered by the universities that are covered as per the university's fee structure:

1. Tuition Fee
2. Living Cost
3. Library Fee
4. Examination Fee
5. EDB and Book Bank
6. International Student Development Fund
7. 24-Hour WiFi Cost
8. Maintenance Fee, Water Bill, and Electricity Bill.
6/1/24, 11:53 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Please let me know once you have gone through my above message and when you are ready to continue with our discussion. I look forward to discussing how one can utilize the "Earn While You Learn" Program to make his/her education even more affordable and helping you understand the steps involved in securing this scholarship offer.

6/1/24, 12:26 PM - +27 67 361 6520: Is it is who are paying the above amount
6/1/24, 3:19 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your concerns I have taken a note of all your queries and I would love to continue with our discussion, since it's been a long day for me, along with the conclusion of our working hours, let's plan to reconnect on Monday to continue our discussion.

I trust this message finds you well. I wanted to follow up on our previous conversation and inquire if you're currently available to connect with us. This would allow us to continue our discussion as we had originally planned.
11/1/24, 6:30 PM - +27 67 361 6520: Evening am available
11/1/24, 6:36 PM - +27 73 055 2749: Yes we are available
11/1/24, 9:16 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Coming back to the concern that you shared above. Let me help you explain since you have received a 90% scholarship on your tuition fee and 100% waived off on your accommodation the 10% cost of the tuition fee is to be catered by the parents/ students, please.
11/1/24, 9:17 PM - +27 73 055 2749: Oky
11/1/24, 9:22 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Yes please so may I know if you are clear so far?
11/1/24, 9:27 PM - +27 67 361 6520: It's clear now  but when l saw the figures it was big
11/1/24, 9:28 PM - Kirti Edoofa: It is alright please. Our meeting today is primarily aimed at providing a comprehensive understanding of the offer letter and addressing any concerns you may have. Please be assured that all the queries you have raised will be thoroughly discussed as we proceed.

As we begin our conversation, I will guide you through the letter, ensuring all aspects are clear. Should there be any remaining questions by the end of our discussion, we will certainly address them as well. Could you please let me know if you are ready to start our discussion now?
11/1/24, 9:28 PM - +27 67 361 6520: Was saying how do they work the 10% but let's go ahead
11/1/24, 9:29 PM - +27 67 361 6520: We are ready we end up feeling sleepy while waiting for u
11/1/24, 9:31 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for that @27673616520 I understand that you must be tired but I even get occupied with work meetings and hence today I am stretching an hour extra so that I can make you understand the letter better even though it is past my available hours now.
11/1/24, 9:32 PM - +27 67 361 6520: Yaa l understand the body will be tired
11/1/24, 9:33 PM - +27 73 055 2749: Oky
11/1/24, 9:33 PM - Kirti Edoofa: May I know if you are comfortable to move ahead with the discussion right now or would you like to connect tomorrow?
11/1/24, 9:36 PM - +27 67 361 6520: Let's discuss and finish at 10
11/1/24, 9:37 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Alright then let us move ahead. Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $1850, let me also guide you on how we can make your education more affordable.

Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
11/1/24, 9:37 PM - Kirti Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn. 

The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. Is this clear to you?
11/1/24, 9:40 PM - +27 67 361 6520: Yes
11/1/24, 9:40 PM - +27 73 055 2749: Yes duly noted
11/1/24, 9:40 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that with hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.
11/1/24, 9:40 PM - Kirti Edoofa: With these earned credits, one can use this $1000 to cover a portion of his/her annual fee, which is $1600. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $1600 - $1000 = $600, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.
11/1/24, 9:40 PM - Kirti Edoofa: This illustrates how one can effectively make their education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
11/1/24, 9:41 PM - +27 73 055 2749: Yes
11/1/24, 9:41 PM - +27 67 361 6520: Yes
11/1/24, 9:43 PM - Kirti Edoofa: It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.
11/1/24, 9:43 PM - Kirti Edoofa: With that said, let us now shift our focus to the registration fee of $1000 mentioned in your offer letter from MVN University. 

The registration fee we are discussing here is somewhat unique, especially for Edoofians. Unlike traditional international students, Edoofa students do not need to consider it as an additional cost to their annual education fees. 

Instead, it is considered a part of the first-year education cost. For you, the cost for your first year of education is $1850 and thus the registration fee of $1000 will be adjusted towards the same. Giving you a total of $850 for your university fees. I hope I am clear to you?
11/1/24, 9:45 PM - +27 67 361 6520: Yes its clear
11/1/24, 9:46 PM - +27 73 055 2749: Yes
11/1/24, 9:48 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to see that your financial preparations are in place. I hope you recall that the per annum cost of education and the registration fee figures you mentioned were supposed to face a range of $1200 to $1800 for the annual cost of education and a registration fee between $500 and $1000.
11/1/24, 9:49 PM - Kirti Edoofa: However, based on the discussions we had with your career counselor and their assessment of your application, they encouraged us to secure a higher quantum of scholarship for you. This is the reason the per annum cost of education is only $1600, which is significantly within the general cost of education fee range ($1200 to $1800).
11/1/24, 9:49 PM - Kirti Edoofa: When you look at this opportunity, with a higher quantum of scholarship, the registration fee may also appear a bit higher. Rest assured, this does not increase your financial burden, as it is an integral part of your first year of education cost and will be utilized for the same purpose. I hope this makes sense?
11/1/24, 9:52 PM - +27 67 361 6520: Yes it  is
11/1/24, 9:54 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In continuation of our discussion, I also want to emphasize that this scholarship opportunity for you is exclusive and highly beneficial. Besides this scholarship offer, it is unlikely that you will find a more affordable and high-quality education.
11/1/24, 9:54 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In light of this, I would like to pose a question to you: Would you prefer a scholarship offer that allows you to save at least $850 annually, even if it entails a higher registration fee? Or would you opt for a scholarship offer that forces you to pay a higher cost of education but with a lower registration fee, bearing in mind that the registration fee is part of the first-year expenses?
11/1/24, 9:54 PM - Kirti Edoofa: It's essential to consider the big picture and the overall financial benefits that come with the scholarship offer you have received. Do you not agree with this?
11/1/24, 9:56 PM - +27 73 055 2749: Oky
11/1/24, 9:58 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Glad to see we share the same perspective. Now talking about the registration fee, as mentioned previously, the admission and processing fee of $1,000 specified in your offer letter will be adjusted against the first-year expenses of $1,850. Consequently, the amount you'll need to pay after you arrive in India will be $1,850 - $1,000 = $850. This amount can be paid in two installments of $425 and $425, spaced 6 months apart.

The first installment can be paid either before arrival in India or within three days of arrival in August 2024. The second installment will be due in the subsequent semester, in January 2025.

I hope this clarifies the fee structure, and are we aligned on these options?
11/1/24, 9:58 PM - +27 73 055 2749: I think it's better to be offered a scholarship that allows us to save $850 annually, even if it entails a higher registration fee
11/1/24, 10:03 PM - +27 67 361 6520: It's better to pay the installment in two parts
11/1/24, 10:06 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Moving forward with our discussion, as you can see in the offer letter, it's outlined that a student is required to submit a registration fee of $1000 within 15 days to secure their scholarship seat with the university. This sets the *deadline date as January 20, 2024*.
11/1/24, 10:06 PM - Kirti Edoofa: However, in reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $100 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
11/1/24, 10:07 PM - +27 67 361 6520: Yes explain
11/1/24, 10:08 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Given the $100 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent you will be responsible for the remaining $900 of the registration fee. This $900 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of $450 before the first deadline date of *January 20, 2024* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of $450 before the second deadline date of *February 20, 2024* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
11/1/24, 10:08 PM - Kirti Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to *make the full payment of $900 within 15 working days, before January 20, 2024*. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
11/1/24, 10:10 PM - +27 73 055 2749: Oky
11/1/24, 10:13 PM - +27 67 361 6520: We can split it into two parts
11/1/24, 10:14 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
11/1/24, 10:14 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
11/1/24, 10:19 PM - +27 67 361 6520: No we Stay in south Africa as for now
11/1/24, 10:20 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
11/1/24, 10:20 PM - Kirti Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
11/1/24, 10:20 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
11/1/24, 10:22 PM - +27 67 361 6520: We are not in Harare
11/1/24, 10:22 PM - +27 67 361 6520: As l mentioned above
11/1/24, 10:23 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mama money for your enrollment fee.
11/1/24, 10:23 PM - +27 67 361 6520: Yaa that one is better
11/1/24, 10:25 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please. Now, that you have all the details with you and understand the letter better, I would like to enquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
11/1/24, 10:29 PM - +27 67 361 6520: U can share the insight
11/1/24, 10:31 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, in that case, let me share a few insights into MVN University with you -

Have you had an opportunity to consider which payment plan would be most suitable for you?

13/1/24, 11:02 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know of this.

I hope this message finds you all well and in high spirits. I apologize for not being in touch over the past few days. Unfortunately, I was dealing with a significant ENT infection and needed to follow my doctor's recommendation for rest, which meant taking some time off to prioritize my health. As a result, I was unable to inform you about my temporary absence. Thankfully, I'm feeling considerably better now and am ready to resume our interactions. Before we proceed with our discussion, I'd like to catch up - how have you and your family been lately?

26/1/24, 3:17 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing. As I was organizing my day today I noticed that you missed your deadline on the 20th of Jan you mentioned that you would be making the deposit of $450 on the 13th of Jan so I would like to understand if you were able to make the deposit of your registration fee?
26/1/24, 3:20 PM - +27 67 361 6520: We did not because we were not available  and on the other note we were waiting for u coz we were not going to be able to pay unless u create the order for u
26/1/24, 3:20 PM - +27 67 361 6520: Us
26/1/24, 3:22 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @27673616520 I completely understand that my absence affected the process however, my health was also my priority at that time, and that is why I have discussed with the academic board to grant an extension till the 31st of January which is exactly when the university closes the round of applications for this month. Because I did not want my absence to affect you reserving your seat.
26/1/24, 3:26 PM - +27 67 361 6520: Ok we were also feeling sorry for yr health that is the first thing which u need to do life comes first then other things follow. So  our second payment would be end of February ??
26/1/24, 3:27 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @27673616520 Thank you for your concern. Yes please the next payment deadline will the in February 20th only as the previous one.
26/1/24, 3:28 PM - +27 67 361 6520: Ohk it cannot be extended to 29 February?
26/1/24, 3:32 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @27673616520 may I know why would the second deadline be extended since for the first one the delay was from my side as I was not available due to my illness and hence I had a discussion with the board so that my absence does not affect Kudzai's seat with the university.
26/1/24, 3:33 PM - +27 67 361 6520: No it was just a question so that l will be able to source funds if possible
26/1/24, 3:35 PM - +27 67 361 6520: The other thing is that l get paid when the month ends
26/1/24, 3:40 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @27673616520 thank you for letting me know that, in that case, can surely have a discussion when your second deadline approaches, however, for now, I would like to understand your preparations for the first installment and when are you planning to make the deposit as well?
26/1/24, 3:44 PM - +27 67 361 6520: For the first payment l can make the deposit on the 31
26/1/24, 3:45 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that. However, regarding the order, you must be aware that there is a monthly account transaction limit for Mama Money. I just checked with the accounts team and they mentioned that the Mama Money's Limit for this month has been reached due to a higher number of students joining the program from South Africa.
26/1/24, 3:45 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Since you are planning to make the payments in parts, here is what you can do: visit the Mama Money agent you went to last time and provide them with the following details for the payment:

- Beneficiary Name: Avreen Singh
- Bank Name: ICICI Bank
- Savings Account Number: 055201503452
- IFSC Code: ICIC0000552
26/1/24, 3:45 PM - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>

26/1/24, 4:16 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that.  I have taken note of these details and I will update the university officials accordingly. 

As you navigate through your admission journey, please remember that if you encounter any challenges or have any concerns that could potentially hinder your progress, do not hesitate to reach out to me here. I trust that you will keep this in mind and feel comfortable reaching out when needed, right?
26/1/24, 4:24 PM - +27 67 361 6520: Yes thank u so much for being there for us as a family
26/1/24, 4:24 PM - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. I appreciate you for keeping me informed. I will also ensure that the university officials are updated on our progress.

With your sessions now completed, and the offer letter in your possession, your next important step is to ensure the payment of your university registration fee within the shared deadline to secure your scholarship seat.
26/1/24, 4:24 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Once you have made the payment, please share the receipt with me here. This will enable me to promptly confirm the transaction with our accounts team and notify the university officials. Remember, I am here to assist you, so please don't hesitate to reach out if you require any support or guidance during this process. 

With that, we will be bringing our today’s discussion to a close. Wishing you a wonderful week ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well!

I trust you are in good health. I apologize for not reaching out earlier, as my family is currently facing a challenging situation with the passing of my grandfather. I have been occupied with the necessary rituals and, as a result, was unable to connect with you.
27/2/24, 3:08 PM - +27 67 361 6520: We are so sorry for the loss may u be comforted

27/2/24, 6:07 PM - +27 73 055 2749: Oky thank you
27/2/24, 6:17 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now coming back to our discussion. As I was sorting out my tasks for the day, I had a chance to look over your scholarship application file and noticed that there's a remaining balance of $488 for the university registration fee, which was due by February 20th, 2024.

Consequently, I wanted to reach out to inquire have you been able to deposit the amount by now? <This message was edited>
27/2/24, 6:40 PM - +27 67 361 6520: No we have not yet deposited as l have said previous that am not paid 20 th but monthend
27/2/24, 7:04 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I do recall that you mentioned that you would be able to clear the balance by the end of this month, may I know if my understanding is correct here?
27/2/24, 7:08 PM - +27 67 361 6520: Yes
27/2/24, 7:10 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, in that case, let me update the university officials about the same. Once you have made the payment, please share the receipt with me here.
27/2/24, 7:12 PM - +27 67 361 6520: I wil do that l want to ask something after this what is next concerning monies needed l heard you last time talking about processing of the visa can u explain
27/2/24, 7:16 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @27673616520 Apart from this you will not need to pay any other fee once Kudzai arrives in India, then you can clear the remaining fee, and all you need to save is for the visa processing fee which is $83 which is a one time investment and we will be guiding you in that process 2-3 months prior the student's arrival.
27/2/24, 7:21 PM - +27 67 361 6520: I want to understand the remaining fee which u are talking about so that l do not get confused
27/2/24, 7:21 PM - +27 67 361 6520: So that everything to be clear
27/2/24, 7:27 PM - Kirti Edoofa: May I know if you recall our previous discussion above?
27/2/24, 7:32 PM - +27 67 361 6520: Yes
27/2/24, 7:35 PM - Kirti Edoofa: As you recall Kudzai's first-year tuition fee is $1850, and once you complete the registration fee of $1000, it will be adjusted towards the first-year tuition fee and the remaining balance of $850 can be cleared when Kudzai arrives in India, in August 2024. 

May I know if you are clear now?
27/2/24, 7:38 PM - +27 67 361 6520: Is me who clears the balance
27/2/24, 7:38 PM - +27 67 361 6520: ?
27/2/24, 7:41 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please. Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
27/2/24, 7:41 PM - Kirti Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn. 

The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. Is this clear to you?
