Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
6/2/24, 9:36 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program:* Talking about the third video, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
6/2/24, 9:36 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP:* Another thing is that Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based. 

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
6/2/24, 9:38 PM - +263 78 221 4255: Noted and understood

I think that my country's development has reached a certain level of stagnation, to be honest. This is partially due to the large amount of debt we have sunk into due to power supply issues. We have had to resort to importing electrical power, incurring large electrical bills. This is in part due to a shortage of sustainable power supply plants here in Zimbabwe. There is a crisis in which even industries are being affected by power cuts to reduce loads on the national electrical power grid. This is where I intend to help as an electrical engineer. Once I have gained the influence and the know-how to do so, I will spearhead initiatives to bring more clean and sustainable energy to both homes and industries alike, targeting small towns like my home town improve development rates in rural and remote areas.
7/2/24, 11:46 AM - +263 78 221 4255: 3.
My company of choice, now and hopefully in the future would be the Zimbabwe Electrical Supply Authority (ZESA). I think this would go a long way in fulfilling my long term goals. Being part of the main distributor of Electrical power here in Zimbabwe would give me the influence that I want to have on national systems. It is also one of the more prominent organisations here in my country and would therefore open a gateway of opportunities to also expand operations out of Zimbabwe. It would abridge my influence to other countries as it already has strong international relations with other surrounding countries, of particular interest being South Africa which is also under supply stress in terms of electricity. They also already have a vibrant division of Electrical engineers and power supply experts who would go a long way in making the vision come to life.

The difference between electronics and electrical systems isvery simple but yet slightly paradoxical. In fact one can say that one is a sub-variant of the other. From what I understand, electronics refers to devices that use electrical energy to perfom certain functions. These include small devices like wristwatches to bigger appliances like televisions. Electronics specifically use  electrical energy to perfom specialized or complex functions efficiently. Electrical systems is a much broader term which refers to any system that uses electricity. This includes everything from simply transferring power like the national power grid to utilizing the power like large industrial motor system which use large amounts of power. Electrical systems are not limited to that however, as even small devices like cellphones can be considered electrical systems. Hence I would say that electronics are a more specific form of  electrical systems.
7/2/24, 12:13 PM - +263 78 221 4255: 5.
A capacitor is a device that stores electrical energy in an electric field. It consists of two conductors separated by an insulator (a dielectric), like two metal plates with a layer of plastic or other insulator in between. When a voltage is applied to the capacitor, the plates become charged and the dielectric stores the energy in the form of an electric field. When the voltage is removed, the capacitor releases the stored energy. It is common misconception that capacitors store charge. This is false of course as they store energy in form of electrical fileds. Capacitors are used in a wide range of industries, from consumer electronics to power grids. One of the most common uses for capacitors is in filtering circuits. They're used to smooth out the voltage in power supplies, reducing noise and ripple. They're also used in timing circuits, as they can store and release energy at specific intervals. And they're used in energy storage applications, like batteries and supercapacitors. Capacitors come in many different shapes and sizes, depending on their intended use.Ceramic capacitors are one of the most common types of capacitors, and they're used in a wide range of applications. They're made of ceramic materials like barium titanate or lead zirconate titanate. They're small, inexpensive, and have a high capacitance-to-volume ratio, which makes them ideal for use in high-frequency circuits. They're also non-polarized, meaning they can be connected to the circuit in either direction. However, they have a relatively high leakage current and are sensitive to temperature changes.
7/2/24, 12:25 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Lenon.

7/2/24, 2:23 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for submitting the SOP form, it is duly noted with us, and thank you for the update. It's great to hear that you've connected with your EWYL Mentor, Ms. Aditi. I appreciate you sharing the session date with us. 

Please make sure to mark your calendar for the session scheduled. This mentorship opportunity can provide valuable insights and guidance for her academic and personal development. Wish you all the best!
7/2/24, 2:24 PM - +263 78 221 4255: Thank you very much. 🙏🏾
7/2/24, 2:27 PM - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. *Now with this, we have completed the second step of your university admission cycle, and hence we will move forward to the third step in your admission journey.*
7/2/24, 2:27 PM - Kirti Edoofa: To be on the same page, If I am correct, I believe you want to pursue a bachelor's degree in the course B.Tech (Electrical Engineering) for your higher education in India as per the August 2024 intake?
7/2/24, 2:27 PM - +263 78 221 4255: That is correct.
7/2/24, 2:29 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation. Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission* Are you ready to start with that?
7/2/24, 2:30 PM - +263 78 221 4255: Of course. We can proceed
7/2/24, 2:31 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
7/2/24, 2:31 PM - Kirti Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
7/2/24, 2:31 PM - Kirti Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
7/2/24, 2:31 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
7/2/24, 2:34 PM - +263 78 221 4255: Yeah. It's impractical for sure
7/2/24, 2:35 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
7/2/24, 2:35 PM - Kirti Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $1000. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
7/2/24, 2:35 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
7/2/24, 2:38 PM - +263 78 221 4255: Correct. And I have noted it
7/2/24, 2:39 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
7/2/24, 2:53 PM - +263 78 221 4255: We are on the same page
7/2/24, 2:55 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:
7/2/24, 2:55 PM - Kirti Edoofa: 1. *Tuition Fee*: $1800 per annum
2. *Food and Accommodation Fee*: $1000 per annum 

*Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum*

Registration Fee to be paid: $1000 (deadline within two weeks of issue of the offer letter, part of the university’s first-year fee and will be adjusted against the first-year cost of education $2800). I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?
7/2/24, 2:56 PM - +263 78 221 4255: Noted
7/2/24, 2:57 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $1000, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $1000 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
7/2/24, 2:57 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $1000 = $1800. This amount can be paid in two installments of $900 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $900 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
7/2/24, 2:59 PM - +263 78 221 4255: Noted and understood
7/2/24, 2:59 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
7/2/24, 2:59 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
7/2/24, 2:59 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
7/2/24, 3:02 PM - +263 78 221 4255: Got it
7/2/24, 3:02 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
7/2/24, 3:06 PM - +263 78 221 4255: How much is the total cost, on average, of booking a flight ticket and VISA application
7/2/24, 3:09 PM - Kirti Edoofa: The average cost of a flight ticket from Zimbabwe to India will be between $400 to $500 and will have to be paid by the student itself. The tickets are to be booked after one gets their visa from the embassy and the visa fee is $83, which is a one-time investment.
7/2/24, 3:10 PM - +263 78 221 4255: Noted
7/2/24, 3:10 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now with this, we are done with step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
7/2/24, 3:10 PM - Kirti Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one.
7/2/24, 3:10 PM - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
7/2/24, 3:13 PM - +263 78 221 4255: I hope so. Thank you for sharing this
7/2/24, 3:15 PM - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
7/2/24, 3:15 PM - Kirti Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received special news for the students of the 2024 admission intake. May I know if you are excited to know the news we have for you?
7/2/24, 3:17 PM - +263 78 221 4255: Very excited. Please continue
7/2/24, 3:26 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am happy to see that you are excited. After speaking with thousands of students and parents who completed their admission process before you, we realized that the current economic situation in African countries makes it a bit challenging for parents to pay the full registration fee at once. 

In response to the same challenge, we had a detailed discussion with the academic board and university official. As a result, we developed a solution to alleviate the financial burden of the parents specifically for the registration fee due of $500 to $1000.
7/2/24, 3:26 PM - Kirti Edoofa: We at Edoofa are thrilled about this development, and I believe it will significantly help all of our students and their families. Are you aware of the solution?
7/2/24, 3:28 PM - +263 78 221 4255: No. Enlighten me
7/2/24, 3:29 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright, let me share the same. With respect to the conversation we had with the academic board and the university officials, we requested them to allow the students to make the payment of their registration fee in two parts within a span of 45 days thereby reducing the financial pressure.
7/2/24, 3:29 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: Consider that your registration fee is $1000. After you will receive the offer letter, the first part of the registration fees which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, i.e. $500 needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university (For most of the universities 15 days). Subsequently, the second part of $500, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
7/2/24, 3:29 PM - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for February 15, 2024, and your registration fee stands at $1000, you'll need to make a payment of $500 on or before February 15, 2024. The remaining $500 should be paid by March 15, 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
7/2/24, 3:32 PM - +263 78 221 4255: Not at this stage
7/2/24, 3:33 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. As your guardian, I am sure your parents are excited to initiate the process? For the current round of admissions, only 31 scholarship seats are available and hence let us begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the payment plan offered for the registration fee. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
7/2/24, 4:20 PM - +263 78 221 4255: Yes
7/2/24, 4:28 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to *evaluate your application* after which if they accept your application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.

21/2/24, 10:59 AM - +263 78 221 4255: Hello @917292063289 can you tell me more about the off campus accomodations and the cost
26/2/24, 6:00 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening, Parents and Lenon.

I trust you are in good health. I apologize for not reaching out earlier, as my family is currently facing a challenging situation with the passing of my grandfather. I have been occupied with the necessary rituals and, as a result, I was unable to connect with you.
26/2/24, 8:38 PM - +263 77 399 7978: Good evening.

We are so sorry to hear the passing of your grandfather... please accept our sincere condolences.
27/2/24, 5:58 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, I hope you are doing well.

I appreciate your kind words. Thank you for your sympathy and support. It means a lot to my family and me. However, I am now available to connect with you now
27/2/24, 7:23 PM - +263 77 399 7978: Sure . Thanks.
27/2/24, 7:33 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Coming to your query you inquired above may I know what in particular would you want me to explain about the off-campus accommodation?
27/2/24, 8:40 PM - +263 77 399 7978: Ooh, it's the young man, Lenon , who asked , and he is not around with me at the moment ...and there is always a network problem where he is., such that I also have problems communicating with him.
So , I think he will come back to you with the question as soon as is able to.
*Sorry for any inconveniences.*
27/2/24, 8:48 PM - Kirti Edoofa: It is alright please, I shall surely wait for his response.
27/2/24, 9:08 PM - +263 78 221 4255: Sorry for the delay.
I wanted to understand the costs of the off campus housing and the "self cooking facility"  mentioned in the offer letter
27/2/24, 9:10 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Surely, let me help you understand. You will be able to seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

 If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also go for accommodation independently and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
27/2/24, 9:13 PM - +263 78 221 4255: Okay. Tell me more about the independent accomodation for 800 per annum please
27/2/24, 9:25 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Surely let me help you understand all our students stay off-campus since it is cheaper compared to the on-campus and students have the freedom to cook for themselves as well off- campus also includes the same number of facilities as the on-campus Now I understand that being parents and a student who will be moving to a new country you can be concerned about the safety and security at off- campus.
27/2/24, 9:25 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I'd like to emphasize that when it comes to off-campus accommodations, the convenience factor is truly outstanding. These housing options are strategically located within walking distance of the university campus, ensuring that students can easily commute to and from their classes. Along with that, all the basic facilities such as WiFi, Water Purifier, AC, etc. are included in the facilities, please.
27/2/24, 9:26 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Furthermore, it's important to note that all these accommodations are situated within gated communities, which adds an extra layer of security and peace of mind. To bolster security even further, there is 24-hour CCTV surveillance in place, creating a safe and secure environment for students. I hope this gives you the requires assurance in terms of safety and security, right?
27/2/24, 9:32 PM - +263 78 221 4255: Okay. So how are the payments for such accomodations made. Monthly? Or annualy? Or per semester?
27/2/24, 9:34 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Since you will directly be paying to the landlord you have the option to pay monthly.
27/2/24, 9:35 PM - +263 78 221 4255: Noted
27/2/24, 9:38 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Yes please, I hope all your concerns have been addressed?
27/2/24, 9:42 PM - +263 78 221 4255: Yes of course.... But it would be appreciated if you could share a few pictures of these typica off campus housing facilities
27/2/24, 9:45 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Surely I can do that, first thing tomorrow in the morning, however, since it is past our available hours now I will not be able to continue the discussion so let us reconnect tomorrow again.
27/2/24, 9:46 PM - +263 78 221 4255: Okay. Good night
