12/1/24, 4:47 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Tadiwanashe, 

I hope this message finds you well. It has been a while since we last connected, and I wanted to take this opportunity to share some exciting news with you. Recently, Edoofa hosted a conference called the *Symposium of Leaders, Innovators, and Creators at Edoofa, also known as 'SLICE-CON.'* 

The conference was attended by all the Edoofians of 2023 and a few senior Edoofians from previous batches. It focused on the art of creation, innovation, and, most importantly, the mindset required to make an impact in one's career.
12/1/24, 4:47 PM - Kirti Edoofa: During this Industrial Visit and the conference - SLICE CON, Corporate leaders, such as the CEOs and Co-founders from renowned companies like Rage Coffee, Sirona Hygiene, Jolin New York, and more, shared their insights and experiences. These individuals are at the helm of multi-millionaire brands, leading large marketing teams. Their presence added immense value, providing students with the opportunity to engage in transformative conversations.
12/1/24, 4:47 PM - Kirti Edoofa: We believe that interactions with such industry leaders can bring significant transformations to students' lives, enhancing their business acumen. Our Edoofians maximized this opportunity, having life-changing conversations with these influential figures. The main objective of the event was to emphasize the importance of thinking outside the box and encouraging students to believe in themselves and their dreams.
12/1/24, 4:47 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Hence, I wanted to reach out to you today to share a glimpse of the conference, and I hope you too are excited to attend such events when you come to India.

13/1/24, 9:34 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Tadiwanashe.

I hope you are doing well. Thank you for sharing your results, and congratulations on successfully clearing all your A-Level subjects! Your hard work over the past few months has truly paid off.

I'm sure your family is immensely proud of your achievements. Your A-level results have been duly noted, and we will promptly add them to your scholarship application. This will enable us to engage in discussions with the academic board and chart the best course of action for your next steps.
13/1/24, 10:00 AM - +263 71 399 5661: You a welcome Sir
13/1/24, 10:02 AM - +263 77 247 0719: Noted
13/1/24, 10:05 AM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. I trust you remember our last conversation, where we discussed the formalities the admission team was handling for your university admission. To ensure we are on the same page, let me recap what the team has been working on since then.

Following our last session, we submitted your application to multiple universities for scholarship consideration. However, as some time had passed without receiving any updates from the university officials, I personally took the initiative to inquire about the status of your application, which was submitted.
13/1/24, 10:05 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Upon requesting an update from the university officials, we learned that the eligibility criteria for the B.Tech (Mechanical Engineering) course had been revised in accordance with government guidelines for the August 2024 academic intake. While your documents were evaluated, the universities found you eligible for the scholarship. However, due to changes in government guidelines, you were not ineligible for the course B.Tech (Mechanical Engineering).
13/1/24, 10:06 AM - Kirti Edoofa: According to the updated eligibility criteria, students need to have studied Chemistry in their A-levels to pursue the B.Tech (Mechanical Engineering). Unfortunately, as you did not have the required subject, they indicated that you are currently ineligible for the program.
13/1/24, 10:06 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Since these updates, the team has been actively working to find a solution for you. We engaged in detailed discussions with the university officials to address this situation. As a team, our goal has been to ensure that you can pursue a course aligned with your career interests. 

With the grace of God, we were able to find a solution, and we would like to share the highlights of our discussion and the solutions we have explored for you. If we are together, shall I share the same solution with you?
13/1/24, 10:11 AM - +263 77 247 0719: Yes u can
13/1/24, 10:12 AM - Kirti Edoofa: After engaging in discussions with university officials and the academic board, we are pleased to inform you that we have identified a solution that not only allows you to pursue your desired course but also emphasizes the significance of selecting the right career path. 

The university officials highlighted that the foundational subjects for all engineering courses are the same in the first year of education. Recognizing the importance of helping you bridge the gap created by your initial subject combination, they assessed your eligibility for the course  B.Tech Computer Science Engineering, which is highly sought-after in the 21st century.
13/1/24, 10:12 AM - Kirti Edoofa: As a result, you will embark on the journey of pursuing B.Tech Computer Science Engineering in your first year. If, in the second year, you decide to revert to your original course, you can do so by changing your major. Alternatively, should you discover a growing interest in Computer Science Engineering, you can seamlessly continue in that field.

We believe that this solution aligns with your career goals and will enable you to stay on track effectively. We wanted to share this update with you and are eager to hear your thoughts on this matter?
13/1/24, 11:02 AM - +263 77 247 0719: He accepted the offer u can go ahead
13/1/24, 11:04 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that. Thank you for sharing the confirmation with me here. Now, on that note, please write a mail to "*academicboard@edoofa.com*" stating that you had a discussion with your admission officer Ms. Kirti about changing your course from Btech Mechanical Engineering to Btech Computer Science Engineering for the intake 2024 and that you have finalized the same for yourself.

24/1/24, 12:54 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Tadiwanashe,

I trust you're all having a good day. I want to start by apologizing for my absence over the past week. Unfortunately, I was unwell with a severe ENT infection, which required me to rest as per my doctor's advice. Thankfully, I'm feeling much improved now and am eager to reconnect with you so we can continue our discussions. But before we proceed, I'm curious to hear about how your last week went?
24/1/24, 12:55 PM - +263 78 989 3876: It was good

24/1/24, 9:45 PM - +263 77 247 0719: Well noted thank you
25/1/24, 6:51 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Tadiwanashe.

I hope you are doing well. With regard to our conversation yesterday since we were not able to move further with our discussion may I know if you are available to connect with us now so that we can continue with our discussion?
25/1/24, 6:52 PM - +263 77 247 0719: Yes we are
25/1/24, 6:52 PM - +263 77 247 0719: Good evening
25/1/24, 6:58 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
25/1/24, 6:58 PM - +263 77 247 0719: Yes we are
25/1/24, 7:00 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing. Now let us move forward with the letter discussion. So may I know if you are ready?
25/1/24, 7:03 PM - +263 77 247 0719: Yes we are ready
25/1/24, 7:10 PM - +263 78 989 3876: Ready
25/1/24, 7:13 PM - +263 77 247 0719: Ready
25/1/24, 7:15 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Certainly, you are absolutely correct. I would like to provide some additional details regarding your offer letter from the Gulzar Group of Institutes. As you can see, following the scholarship, your annual tuition fee amounts to $1400.

In the first year, it is compulsory for students to select on-campus hostel accommodation, primarily because the university needs to complete their Foreigners Regional Registration Office (FRRO) formalities. However, from the second year onwards, students have the flexibility to choose off-campus housing if they prefer, as they would have become more familiar with the area and likely formed connections with their classmates.
25/1/24, 7:16 PM - +263 77 247 0719: Following
25/1/24, 7:16 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Furthermore, the university intentionally assigns roommates to students to foster a supportive and communal atmosphere, enabling students to rely on their peers for assistance and companionship. 

This approach enhances the overall living experience and contributes to a sense of security and camaraderie within the student community. I hope you have taken note of this and this clarifies the tuition fee and the accommodation facilities for you?
25/1/24, 7:17 PM - +263 78 989 3876: Okay, following
25/1/24, 7:21 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In light of this, let us move forward with our discussion. As you are now familiar with your annual fee at Gulzar Group of Institutes, let me outline the various facilities and services covered by the university's fee structure:

1. Tuition Fee
2. Living/Accommodation Costs
3. Food Costs
4. Library Fee
5. 24-Hour Wifi Access
6. Maintenance Fee
7. Water Bill
8. Electricity Bill

These components collectively make up the comprehensive package that you will receive as part of his university fee, ensuring a well-rounded and hassle-free educational experience. I hope we are together so far and this resonates with you?
25/1/24, 7:23 PM - +263 77 247 0719: Following
25/1/24, 7:29 PM - +263 78 989 3876: Following
25/1/24, 7:34 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now that we have established the tuition fee at $1400 and accommodation fee at $1200, making your total annual education cost $2600, let me guide you on how we can make his education more affordable.

Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. Through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
25/1/24, 7:35 PM - Kirti Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn. 

The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. Is this clear to you?
25/1/24, 7:38 PM - +263 78 989 3876: Clear
25/1/24, 7:40 PM - Kirti Edoofa: With this said, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that you with your hard work earn scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.
25/1/24, 7:40 PM - Kirti Edoofa: With these earned credits, he can use this $1000 to cover a portion of his annual fee, which is $2600. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $2600 - $1000 = $1600, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.
25/1/24, 7:40 PM - Kirti Edoofa: This illustrates how you can effectively make his education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
25/1/24, 7:44 PM - +263 78 989 3876: Noted
25/1/24, 7:45 PM - Kirti Edoofa: It's reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.

Having said that, let us now shift our focus to the registration fee mentioned in your offer letter.
25/1/24, 7:46 PM - Kirti Edoofa: As previously mentioned, the registration fee of $750 is not an additional cost; instead, it's a part of your first-year tuition fee. Therefore, it will be adjusted against the total fee of $2600 for the first year. 

Consequently, the remaining fee that you will be required to pay after your arrives in India will be $2600 - $750 = $1850. This amount can be conveniently paid in two installments of $925 and $925, with a six-month gap between them. <This message was edited>
25/1/24, 7:46 PM - Kirti Edoofa: The first installment can be paid either before your arrival in India or within three days of his arrival in August 2024. The second installment will be due in the subsequent semester, in January 2025.

I hope this information is clear and we both have a shared understanding of this arrangement?
25/1/24, 7:56 PM - +263 78 989 3876: Noted
25/1/24, 7:58 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on January 29th, 2024*. I hope we are together so far?
25/1/24, 8:37 PM - +263 77 247 0719: Yes well noted thank you for the clarification
25/1/24, 8:44 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
25/1/24, 8:52 PM - +263 77 247 0719: Yes you can go ahead
25/1/24, 9:01 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $600 of the registration fee. This $600 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$300 before the first deadline date of January 29th, 2024* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$300 before the second deadline date of February 29th, 2024* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
25/1/24, 9:01 PM - Kirti Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $600 within 15 working days, before January 29th, 2024. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
25/1/24, 9:03 PM - +263 78 989 3876: Noted Thank you
25/1/24, 9:04 PM - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
25/1/24, 9:04 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
25/1/24, 9:04 PM - +263 78 989 3876: Yes in Harare
25/1/24, 9:05 PM - +263 77 247 0719: This is clear will make the payment of 300 on the 29th and bal February
25/1/24, 9:05 PM - +263 77 247 0719: Are we not using the same account we used to deposit the $350
25/1/24, 9:10 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
25/1/24, 9:10 PM - Kirti Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
25/1/24, 9:10 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
25/1/24, 9:13 PM - +263 77 247 0719: Alright
25/1/24, 9:13 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
25/1/24, 9:13 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Charles Bank for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference? <This message was edited>
25/1/24, 9:14 PM - +263 77 247 0719: Yes you can
25/1/24, 9:18 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Let me do the same. If making the payment through Mr. Charle’s is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

Account Holder - Charles Jerera
Account Number - 5333 0380 1404 8828
Bank Name - FBC Bank Limited 
Branch - Masvingo
25/1/24, 9:18 PM - +263 77 247 0719: Thank you

25/1/24, 9:27 PM - Kirti Edoofa: This is undoubtedly an exciting moment for you and your family, as you have received a scholarship offer from an Indian university, bringing you one step closer to realising your dream of pursuing education abroad.
25/1/24, 9:27 PM - Kirti Edoofa: As you have your conversation, I recommend keeping a record of any questions or concerns that arise.

25/1/24, 9:27 PM - +263 77 247 0719: Ok well noted
26/1/24, 2:44 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Tadiwanashe!

I hope you are doing well and I find you in high spirits. After our previous discussion, I am sure you and your family were filled with anticipation regarding the offer letter. 

Receiving the university's offer letter is indeed a significant milestone, and I can imagine the excitement that must have accompanied the anticipation of this moment.

Looking forward, I would like to enquire if you and your family had an opportunity to review and discuss the offer letter as a collective?
26/1/24, 3:43 PM - +263 77 247 0719: Yes we managed to do so
26/1/24, 3:43 PM - Kirti Edoofa: It's wonderful to hear that you've had a family discussion about the offer letter, and I am confident that you must all be delighted to witness the positive strides being made toward realizing your higher education goals in India.

Moving forward, after your recent family discussion regarding the offer letter, we genuinely want to ensure that you have all the necessary information and support you may require. Therefore, I would like to ask if you have any specific questions or concerns regarding the offer letter before proceeding further?
26/1/24, 3:56 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I understand, however, Gulzar University values students and the importance of attention required while attending sessions hence pictures during lessons can be a distraction and that is why we have pictures of students during functions and events hosted.
26/1/24, 3:57 PM - +263 77 247 0719: Alright no further questions
26/1/24, 3:57 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That's great to hear.
