16/1/24, 8:22 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Pride,

I trust this message finds you well. I am *Ms. Kirti, the Admission Officer at Edoofa*.  I will be handling the next steps in your university admission journey and will be directing you in the right direction. As we step into the second week of January, I wanted to reach out and share an exciting milestone that India as a country achieved within the first week of 2024 - the successful India's Chandrayaan-3 Engine Test. <This message was edited>
16/1/24, 8:22 PM - Kirti Edoofa: This accomplishment is responsible for the third lunar mission, aiming to land a rover on the Moon's south polar region and conduct scientific studies that could check Moon's viability to sustain life. It signifies a significant scientific advancement, laying the groundwork for future progress.
16/1/24, 8:22 PM - Kirti Edoofa: This achievement has not only pushed boundaries but also inspired young minds all over the world to pursue their dreams. On the same note, I wanted to extend my heartiest wishes for the New Year to you and your family and check in to see how you and your family started your year?
16/1/24, 10:07 PM - +263 71 582 0116: Thank you mam for checking in, I'm doing well together with my family and the new year is perfect so far hope your families and the Edoofa team are also doing well
16/1/24, 10:09 PM - +263 71 582 0116: Chandrayaan Engine sounds really interesting and an opportunity to change many people's minds that doubt the viability of moon to sustain life
17/1/24, 9:39 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Pride.

I hope you are doing well. You are most welcome and I am glad to know that you and your families are doing well. Thank you for asking, we are doing great. With great excitement and pride, I also want to share that over the past few days, the Edoofa team has been immersed in an exciting event we had in store for our students. Edoofa hosted a conference - the Symposium of Leaders, Innovators, and Creators at Edoofa, also known as 'SLICE-CON.'
17/1/24, 9:39 AM - Kirti Edoofa: The conference was attended by all the Edoofians of 2023 and a few senior Edoofians from previous batches. It focused on the art of creation, innovation, and, most importantly, the mindset required to make an impact in one's career.
17/1/24, 9:39 AM - Kirti Edoofa: During this Industrial Visit and the conference - SLICE CON, Corporate leaders, such as the CEOs and Co-founders from renowned companies like Rage Coffee, Sirona Hygiene, Jolin New York, and more, shared their insights and experiences. These individuals are at the helm of multi-millionaire brands, leading large marketing teams. Their presence added immense value, providing students with the opportunity to engage in transformative conversations.
17/1/24, 9:39 AM - Kirti Edoofa: We believe that interactions with such industry leaders can bring significant transformations to students' lives, enhancing their business acumen. Our Edoofians maximized this opportunity, having life-changing conversations with these influential figures. The main objective of the event was to emphasize the importance of thinking outside the box, and encouraging students to believe in themselves and their dreams. Before we discuss your admission journey further, I wanted to share a glimpse of the event, and I hope you are excited to attend similar events when you come to India.

20/1/24, 8:46 AM - +263 71 582 0116: Good day to you all the academic board of Edoofa, I just want to take this opportunity and ask what took place on the 15th of December when the academic board presented my case to the university officials?
20/1/24, 8:52 AM - +263 71 582 0116: If I'm going to be given another chance I was kindly asking if you could review my scholarship percentage since you said it's based on:
A level results
O Level results 
Communication skills
Statement of purpose 
And now all of these are available, so I want to ask is it possible to have a scholarship percentage increment or not.
20/1/24, 8:54 AM - +263 71 582 0116: I'm patiently waiting for a way forward, thank you!
24/1/24, 4:14 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Pride,

I hope this message finds you all well and in high spirits. I apologize for not being in touch over the past few days. Unfortunately, I was dealing with a significant ENT infection and needed to follow my doctor's recommendation for rest, which meant taking some time off to prioritize my health. As a result, I was unable to inform you about my temporary absence. Thankfully, I'm feeling considerably better now and am ready to resume our interactions. Before we proceed with our discussion, I'd like to catch up - how have you and your family been lately?
24/1/24, 4:15 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your results, and congratulations on successfully clearing all your A-Level subjects! Your hard work over the past few months has truly paid off.

I am sure your family is immensely proud of your achievements. Your A-level results have been duly noted, and we will quickly add them to your scholarship application. This will enable us to engage in discussions with the academic board and chart the best course of action for your next steps.
24/1/24, 4:15 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Kindly allow me some time to thoroughly evaluate your results and plan the way forward. Once I have evaluated your results, along with all the other applications for your university admission, we will reconnect with you to discuss the next steps in your academic journey.
24/1/24, 9:59 PM - +263 71 582 0116: We have been doing well, thank you

Hope you are also doing well and have recovered well
24/1/24, 10:00 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that you are doing well. Thank you for asking, I am doing better.
24/1/24, 10:02 PM - +263 71 582 0116: Okay, thank you
10/2/24, 11:20 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings Pride, 

I trust this message finds you in good health. I am *Ms. Kirti, the Admission officer at Edoofa.*  Today while I was organizing my day, I was going through our records, and I came across your scholarship application and noticed that you were one of the dedicated students who was so keen on pursuing your education abroad. However, because of some situations beyond your control, you were not able to turn your dream into a reality and since then we lost touch with each other.

Hence, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out personally and just check in with you and your family. How have you been doing? Were you able to start your higher education by now, or are you still exploring better opportunities?
10/2/24, 3:07 PM - +263 71 582 0116: Thank you for checking in, I'm doing well together with my family. I haven't started my higher education yet and yeah I was looking for something but I have nothing yet
