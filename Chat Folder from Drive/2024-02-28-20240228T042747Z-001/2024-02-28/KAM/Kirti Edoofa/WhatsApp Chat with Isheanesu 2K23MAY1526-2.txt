I trust this message finds you in good health. As we step into the second week of January, I wanted to reach out and share an exciting milestone that India as a country achieved within the first week of 2024 - the successful India's Chandrayaan-3 Engine Test.
12/1/24, 5:50 PM - Kirti Edoofa: This accomplishment is responsible for the third lunar mission, aiming to land a rover on the Moon's south polar region and conduct scientific studies that could check Moon's viability to sustain life. It signifies a significant scientific advancement, laying the groundwork for future progress.
12/1/24, 5:50 PM - Kirti Edoofa: This achievement has not only pushed boundaries but also inspired young minds all over the world to pursue their dreams. On the same note, I wanted to extend my heartiest wishes for the New Year to you and your family and check in to see how you and your family started your year?

24/1/24, 5:02 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Isheanesu,

I hope this message finds you all well and in high spirits. I apologize for not being in touch over the past few days. Unfortunately, I was dealing with a significant ENT infection and needed to follow my doctor's recommendation for rest, which meant taking some time off to prioritize my health. As a result, I was unable to inform you about my temporary absence. Thankfully, I'm feeling considerably better now and am ready to resume our interactions. Before we proceed with our discussion, I'd like to catch up - how have you and your family been lately?
24/1/24, 5:52 PM - +263 78 522 7025: Its alright mam. Everyone is doing well mam and you
24/1/24, 9:38 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for asking, I am doing better now. I would love to continue with our conversation however, given that it's been a long day for me, along with the conclusion of our working hours, let's plan to reconnect tomorrow to continue our discussion. I'm optimistic that you'll be able to connect then. Have a great night, and looking forward to our conversation tomorrow.
24/1/24, 9:40 PM - +263 78 522 7025: Alright mam
25/1/24, 12:00 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Isheanesu.

I hope you are doing well. With regard to our conversation yesterday since we were not able to move further with our discussion may I know if you are available to connect with us now so that we can continue with our discussion?
25/1/24, 4:35 PM - +263 77 430 4299: We( parents) are ready but sometimes we are facing network challenges  lsheanesu is not with us he is staying somewhere
25/1/24, 4:50 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that we can connect and I understand that network can be a challenge, may I know if you are comfortable to proceed with the discussion?
25/1/24, 9:26 PM - +263 77 430 4299: Yes Mam we are cmefortable
25/1/24, 9:28 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. I would love to continue with our conversation however, given that it's been a long day for me, along with the conclusion of our working hours, let's plan to reconnect tomorrow to continue our discussion. I'm optimistic that you'll be able to connect then. Have a great night, and looking forward to our conversation tomorrow.
25/1/24, 9:38 PM - +263 77 430 4299: Ok thanks Mam
26/1/24, 11:05 AM - +263 78 522 7025: Good morning.  Today l think am available
26/1/24, 11:44 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Isheanesu.

I hope you are doing well. With regard to our conversation yesterday since we were not able to move further with our discussion may I know if you are available to connect with us now so that we can continue with our discussion?
26/1/24, 12:04 PM - +263 78 522 7025: Yes mam
26/1/24, 12:06 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. On the auspicious occasion of Republic Day, I extend my heartfelt greetings to you and your loved ones. Today marks a significant moment in our nation's history, a day when we commemorate the enactment of our Constitution and celebrate the enduring spirit of democracy and unity that defines us as a country.

26/1/24, 12:26 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @263785227025 now may I know if you are ready to start with the discussion now?
26/1/24, 12:26 PM - +263 78 522 7025: Yes mam
26/1/24, 12:32 PM - Kirti Edoofa: To be on the same page, If I am correct, I believe you want to pursue a bachelor's degree in the course BCom for your higher education in India as per the August 2024 intake?
26/1/24, 12:34 PM - +263 78 522 7025: Yes mam l chose Bcom but if there is Financial Engineering  l can change
26/1/24, 12:37 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you understand Financial engineering is not a course which is offered by universities. Financial engineering is the use of mathematical techniques to solve financial problems. It is an extended branch of Bcom where after you complete your degree and have understood all the fundamentals then you can pursue a short course for the same and start your career in Financial engineering and for that you would need your foundation in Bcom only, I hope this gives you a better clarity?
26/1/24, 12:38 PM - +263 78 522 7025: Alright mam
26/1/24, 12:39 PM - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
26/1/24, 12:40 PM - +263 78 522 7025: Yes mam
26/1/24, 12:42 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. Could you please share your understanding of the registration process on the University Admission so that I can get to know that if we are on the same page?
26/1/24, 12:44 PM - +263 78 522 7025: I think that's when the admission team process for the vacancy then if there is the University will send you the acceptance letter
26/1/24, 12:49 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I can clearly see that you have understood the process really well. Moving forward I would like to inquire if you have any queries or concerns that you would like to share regarding the registration process?
26/1/24, 12:51 PM - +263 78 522 7025: We can continue
26/1/24, 12:53 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, Now with this, we are done with step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
26/1/24, 12:53 PM - Kirti Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one.
26/1/24, 12:53 PM - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
26/1/24, 1:00 PM - +263 78 522 7025: Alright mam thank you. I will wait
26/1/24, 1:00 PM - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received special news for the students of the 2024 admission intake. May I know if you are excited to know the news we have for you?
26/1/24, 1:15 PM - +263 78 522 7025: Yes mam
26/1/24, 1:15 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am happy to see that you are excited. After speaking with thousands of students and parents who completed their admission process before you, we realized that the current economic situation in African countries makes it a bit challenging for parents to pay the full registration fee at once.
26/1/24, 1:15 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In response to the same challenge, we had a detailed discussion with the academic board and university official. As a result, we developed a solution to alleviate the financial burden of the parents specifically for the registration fee due of $500 to $1000. 

We at Edoofa are thrilled about this development, and I believe it will significantly help all of our students and their families. Are you aware of the solution?
26/1/24, 1:19 PM - +263 78 522 7025: Mmmm am not sure
26/1/24, 1:19 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright, let me share the same. With respect to the conversation we had with the academic board and the university officials, we requested them to allow the students to make the payment of their registration fee in two parts within a span of 45 days thereby reducing the financial pressure.
26/1/24, 1:19 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: Consider that your registration fee is $750. After you will receive the offer letter, the first part of the registration fees which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, i.e. $375 needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university (For most of the universities 15 days). Subsequently, the second part of $375, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
26/1/24, 1:20 PM - +263 78 522 7025: Alright mam
26/1/24, 1:21 PM - +263 78 522 7025: Noted
26/1/24, 1:22 PM - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for January 25, 2024, and your registration fee stands at $750, you'll need to make a payment of $375 on or before January 25, 2024. The remaining $375 should be paid by February 25 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
26/1/24, 1:26 PM - +263 78 522 7025: Everthing noted
26/1/24, 1:32 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. As your guardian, I am sure your parents are excited to initiate the process? For the current round of admissions, only 31 scholarship seats are available and hence let us begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the payment plan offered for the registration fee. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
26/1/24, 1:44 PM - +263 78 522 7025: Yes mam
26/1/24, 1:47 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to *evaluate your application* after which if they accept your application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
26/1/24, 4:56 PM - +263 78 522 7025: Alright mam thank you have a blessed time
30/1/24, 7:29 AM - +263 78 522 7025: Morning everyone. I would like to ask on how l am to get the news, is it to be on WhatsApp or something else

This is something I can not answer as I mentioned above the university 3-5 days to evaluate your application, and every university takes its own time as soon as we receive an update we shall update you please do not worry. However, we look at the positive side of this, you are getting more time to prepare your finances as well and you can save accordingly, right?
