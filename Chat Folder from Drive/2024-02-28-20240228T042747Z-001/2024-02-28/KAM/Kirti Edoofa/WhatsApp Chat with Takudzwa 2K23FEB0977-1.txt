12/1/24, 4:46 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Takudzwa.

I trust this message finds you well. I am *Ms. Kirti, the Admission Officer at Edoofa.* I would like to inform you that Mr. Shivjeet will no longer be available, as he is advancing in his career with a new opportunity. While his departure is a loss for us, we are also filled with pride and joy for his future endeavors. Moving forward, I will be handling the next steps in your university admission journey and will be directing you in the right direction.
12/1/24, 4:46 PM - Kirti Edoofa: It has been a while since we last connected, and I wanted to take this opportunity to share some exciting news with you. Recently, Edoofa hosted a conference called the *Symposium of Leaders, Innovators, and Creators at Edoofa, also known as 'SLICE-CON.'* 

The conference was attended by all the Edoofians of 2023 and a few senior Edoofians from previous batches. It focused on the art of creation, innovation, and, most importantly, the mindset required to make an impact in one's career.
12/1/24, 4:46 PM - Kirti Edoofa: During this Industrial Visit and the conference - SLICE CON, Corporate leaders, such as the CEOs and Co-founders from renowned companies like Rage Coffee, Sirona Hygiene, Jolin New York, and more, shared their insights and experiences. These individuals are at the helm of multi-millionaire brands, leading large marketing teams. Their presence added immense value, providing students with the opportunity to engage in transformative conversations.
12/1/24, 4:46 PM - Kirti Edoofa: We believe that interactions with such industry leaders can bring significant transformations to students' lives, enhancing their business acumen. Our Edoofians maximized this opportunity, having life-changing conversations with these influential figures. The main objective of the event was to emphasize the importance of thinking outside the box and encouraging students to believe in themselves and their dreams.
12/1/24, 4:46 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Hence, I wanted to reach out to you today to share a glimpse of the conference, and I hope you too are excited to attend such events when you come to India.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey.
16/1/24, 3:04 PM - Kirti Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education.

24/1/24, 10:07 PM - +263 78 953 1540: Okay
25/1/24, 11:05 AM - +263 78 953 1540: Good morning ma'am
25/1/24, 1:10 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Takudzwa.

I hope you are doing well. With regard to our conversation yesterday since we were not able to move further with our discussion may I know if you are available to connect with us now so that we can continue with our discussion?
25/1/24, 1:10 PM - +263 78 953 1540: Yes ma'am, good afternoon to you too
25/1/24, 2:06 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that.  I trust you remember our last conversation, where we discussed the formalities the admission team was handling for your university admission. To ensure we are on the same page, let me recap what the team has been working on since then.

Following our last session, we submitted your application to multiple universities for scholarship consideration. However, as some time had passed without receiving any updates from the university officials, I personally took the initiative to inquire about the status of your application, which was submitted.
25/1/24, 2:06 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Upon requesting an update from the university officials, we learned that the eligibility criteria for the B.Tech (Civil Engineering) course had been revised in accordance with government guidelines for the August 2024 academic intake. While your documents were evaluated, the universities found you eligible for the scholarship. However, due to changes in government guidelines, you were not ineligible for the course B.Tech (Civil Engineering)
25/1/24, 2:07 PM - Kirti Edoofa: According to the updated eligibility criteria, students need to have studied Chemistry in their A-levels to pursue the B.Tech (Civil Engineering). Unfortunately, as you did not have the required subject, they indicated that you are currently ineligible for the program.
25/1/24, 2:07 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Since these updates, the team has been actively working to find a solution for you. We engaged in detailed discussions with the university officials to address this situation. As a team, our goal has been to ensure that you can pursue a course aligned with your career interests. 

With the grace of God, we were able to find a solution, and we would like to share the highlights of our discussion and the solutions we have explored for you. If we are together, shall I share the same solution with you?
25/1/24, 2:09 PM - +263 78 953 1540: Yes madam
25/1/24, 2:24 PM - Kirti Edoofa: After engaging in discussions with university officials and the academic board, we are pleased to inform you that we have identified a solution that not only allows you to pursue your desired course but also emphasizes the significance of selecting the right career path. 

The university officials highlighted that the foundational subjects for all engineering courses are the same in the first year of education. Recognizing the importance of helping you bridge the gap created by your initial subject combination, they assessed your eligibility for the course B.Tech Computer Science Engineering, which is highly sought-after in the 21st century.
25/1/24, 2:24 PM - Kirti Edoofa: As a result, you will embark on the journey of pursuing B.Tech Computer Science Engineering in your first year. If, in the second year, you decide to revert to your original course, you can do so by changing your major. Alternatively, should you discover a growing interest in Computer Science Engineering, you can seamlessly continue in that field.

We believe that this solution aligns with your career goals and will enable you to stay on track effectively. We wanted to share this update with you and are eager to hear your thoughts on this matter?
25/1/24, 2:27 PM - +263 78 953 1540: Okay, What other options do I have  besides Computer Science Engineering
25/1/24, 3:44 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @263789531540 may I know what other option are you interested in?
25/1/24, 3:49 PM - +263 78 953 1540: My other option were electrical engineering and Data Science
25/1/24, 4:02 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that @263789531540 let me tell you that your are indeed eligible for Electrical Engineering.
25/1/24, 4:06 PM - +263 78 953 1540: Okay ma'am,  so enroll me in electrical engineering
25/1/24, 4:19 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @263789531540 surely may I know if you would want me explain more about the course?
25/1/24, 4:20 PM - +263 78 953 1540: Yes Ma'am
