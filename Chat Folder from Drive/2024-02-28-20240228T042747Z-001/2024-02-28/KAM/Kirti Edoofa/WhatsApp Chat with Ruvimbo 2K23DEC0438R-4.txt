29/12/23, 5:58 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Ruvimbo!

I hope you are doing well and I find you in high spirits. After our previous discussion, I am sure you and your family were filled with anticipation regarding the opportunity presented by Quest Group of institutions. 

Receiving the university's offer letter is indeed a significant milestone, and I can imagine the excitement that must have accompanied the anticipation of this moment.

Looking forward, I would like to enquire if you and your family had an opportunity to review and discuss the offer letter from Quest Group of institutions as a collective?
29/12/23, 6:06 PM - +263 71 200 6792: Yes indeed we did and thank you so much
29/12/23, 6:11 PM - Kirti Edoofa: It's wonderful to hear that you've had a family discussion about the offer letter, and I am confident that you must all be delighted to witness the positive strides being made toward realizing your higher education goals in India.

As you move forward, I am curious to know how your family conversation went. What are your thoughts and feelings regarding the discussion?
29/12/23, 6:25 PM - +263 71 200 6792: Well spoke about the logistics of it all and how we all are excited for me to embark on this journey
29/12/23, 6:26 PM - +263 71 200 6792: We also spoke about the options to choose whether to stay in the campus or not
29/12/23, 6:27 PM - +263 71 200 6792: We also need you to know that even though it may be difficult to raise all the funds towards this   for our family we are going to try our best
29/12/23, 6:28 PM - +263 77 270 4815: How are you yes we did
29/12/23, 6:38 PM - +263 77 270 4815: Can you explain further about food if she is staying in the campus you have explained me but skipped my mind sorry for that
29/12/23, 8:47 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for asking, I am doing great. Kindly excuse me for not connecting with you earlier. As I was occupied with a work call. Let me help you understand your concerns better. <This message was edited>
29/12/23, 8:48 PM - Kirti Edoofa: It is completely a student's choice to select the accommodation, however, all our students prefer to stay off- campus since it is cheaper compared to the on- campus and students have the freedom to cook for themselves as well and off- campus also includes the same number of facilities like the on-campus now I understand that being parents you can be concerned about the safety and security at off- campus.

I'd like to emphasize that when it comes to off-campus accommodations, the convenience factor is truly outstanding. These housing options are strategically located within walking distance of the university campus, ensuring that students can easily commute to and from their classes. Along with that, all the basic facilities such as WiFi, Water Purifier, AC, etc. are included in the facilities, please.
29/12/23, 8:48 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Furthermore, it's important to note that all these accommodations are situated within gated communities, which adds an extra layer of security and peace of mind. To bolster security even further, there is 24-hour CCTV surveillance in place, creating a safe and secure environment for students. I hope this gives you the requires assurance in terms of safety and security, right?
29/12/23, 10:51 PM - +263 77 270 4815: Okay thankyou
29/12/23, 10:51 PM - +263 77 270 4815: Noted with thanks

Following her undergraduate studies, Valerie gained valuable work experience in India for a year before deciding to pursue her master's degree, also through the Edoofa Program. Her journey and experiences are a testament to the opportunities and support that the Edoofa Program offers.
