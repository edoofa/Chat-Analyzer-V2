I trust this message finds you well, and I hope you are in high spirits. In recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their A-Level results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey.
16/1/24, 12:44 PM - Kirti Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?

Thank you for sharing your results with us. I noticed that your A-level results didn't turn out as we had hoped, particularly with the challenge in one subject. However, I want to take a moment to remind you that this result is not a reflection of your abilities or potential. It's simply a hurdle on your academic journey, one that you are more than capable of overcoming.
17/1/24, 10:22 AM - Kirti Edoofa: It's important to remember that everyone faces setbacks at some point. What matters most is how we respond to them. This is an opportunity for growth and learning. Reflect on the experience, identify areas for improvement, and use this as a stepping stone towards future successes.
17/1/24, 10:22 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Rest assured, that you have Edoofa’s full support in navigating this phase. Whether it's discussing options for retaking the exam, exploring alternative career paths, or just needing someone to guide you, we are here for you. 

I have taken note of your results and I will add them to your scholarship application. This will enable us to engage in discussions with the academic board and chart the best course of action for your next steps.
17/1/24, 10:22 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Kindly allow us some time to thoroughly evaluate your results and plan the way forward. Once we have re-evaluated your application, along with all the other applications, we will reconnect with you to discuss the next steps in your academic journey.

1/2/24, 9:28 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @263773646574 I completely understand that however, please understand that the deadlines are given by the university and you have had an extension already so I would like to understand why you have March in mind for depositing the registration fee?

I hope you are doing well. Since it was the weekend, hence we were unable to connect with you and I am glad to know that you want David to be a part of Edoofa for him to build his career, however, you will have to understand that these deadlines are given by the universities and I believe you did not understand my question well above, even if it is March or February I would like to understand why you have these timings in mind for depositing the registration fees?
5/2/24, 2:49 PM - +263 77 364 6574: We are saying  so because  now we trying to take  loan for David's payments  this month  of Feburary  ,which we shall pay back after  his father  shall finish  his contract  ,March was the grace period .
5/2/24, 6:02 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I completely understand that must have been waiting for the approval of your loan for David's higher education, however if we recall the conversation you had with Mr. Milan it clearly stated that for the first installment you were granted a extension and you were to clear the remaining installment within the next 30 days and still we have been here supporting David's application so what I am unable to understand is what is the exact challenge that you are facing due to which you need another Grace period till March?
