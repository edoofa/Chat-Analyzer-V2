2. Mama Money - If you are planning to make the payment in Rands, that can be done using Mama Money. The transfer charges for the same mode is zero percentage and hence this is the most feasible mode in case one plans to make the payment from South Africa. For this mode, we will share a Mama Money Order and using the reference id mentioned in the same, you will be able to make the deposit in cash at any of the Mama Money stores in your locality

In recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their A-Level results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey.
16/1/24, 2:07 PM - Ashi Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?
16/1/24, 2:13 PM - +263 77 356 4124: I will to go to school and collect because the copy l hve it's not for official use

However, I want to take a moment to remind you that this result is not a reflection of your abilities or potential. It's simply a hurdle on your academic journey, one that you are more than capable of overcoming.

Reflect on the experience, identify areas for improvement, and use this as a stepping stone towards future successes.
16/1/24, 6:55 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Rest assured, that you have Edoofa’s full support in navigating this phase. Whether it's discussing options for retaking the exam, exploring alternative career paths, or just needing someone to guide you, we are here for you. 

I have taken note of your results and I will add them to your scholarship application. This will enable us to engage in discussions with the academic board and chart the best course of action for your next steps.
16/1/24, 6:55 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Kindly allow us some time to thoroughly evaluate your results and plan the way forward. Once we have re-evaluated your application, along with all the other applications, we will reconnect with you to discuss the next steps in your academic journey.

I hope this message finds you well. I am Ms. Kirti, admissions officer here at Edoofa. As we step at the end of the month. I took the opportunity to review your scholarship application file. I observed that you have an upcoming deadline for your university registration fee. Consequently, I wanted to reach out to inquire about your preparations. 

How is your preparation going forward? Have you been able to raise the outstanding amount by now?
26/1/24, 7:37 PM - +263 77 344 0122: Good evening Kirti l'm sorry we have failed to raise the outstanding amount

26/1/24, 8:57 PM - +263 77 344 0122: My husband is not being paid as we were thinking so his salary is nolonger enough to satisfy our needs especially to my kids so we are trying but it's hard especially here in Zimbabwe so we are finding it difficult for Natasha to continue with her studies for now it's heartbreaking for her and us and she has also been crying but we are trying our best but it seemyour best isn't enough in this case.We are considering for her to take a break for 1 or 2 years as we look for the money and maybe if she finds a job and also her us in banking for her studies..It's so heartbreaking for the entire family considering her hardwork she is putting in everything she does and she was also eager to venture in India for her academics but it all went in vain.
26/1/24, 9:04 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that. Based on the insights you have provided, I now have a clearer understanding. While the university's due dates are significant for securing the scholarship seat, I acknowledge the validity of your concerns and as promised, I am here to help you with the same. Considering that your remaining amount due is $592 for the registration what I want to understand is how much is Natasha's father getting paid every month if you do not mind me telling that?
26/1/24, 9:08 PM - +263 77 356 4124: Good evening
26/1/24, 9:08 PM - +263 77 356 4124: $250

26/1/24, 9:12 PM - +263 77 356 4124: This is my father's pay for this month he hasn't received this pay

26/1/24, 9:14 PM - +263 77 356 4124: Month end
26/1/24, 9:21 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In that case, I am sure he must be receiving his salary by the 29 or 30 of the month, right?
26/1/24, 9:33 PM - +263 77 356 4124: Most probably yes
26/1/24, 9:35 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @263773564124 In that case, I would suggest you make a deposit of $100 by the 31st of this month and I personally will have a discussion with the board for your case to help you assist with a very flexible plan.
