29/12/23, 5:58 PM - +263 77 758 4604: Good evening Ladies and Gentlemen. I know we missed a chance to put our son into the best selected University when an offer was given to us. Going forward, A' level results will be out next month and we would be happy to know if Edoofa is still offering us another chance or we look the other way.
29/12/23, 5:58 PM - +263 77 758 4604: My concerns were on accommodation per annum costs and considering other costs too as our son will be in a foreign land.
29/12/23, 5:58 PM - +263 77 758 4604: I will be happy to know your response so we can make correct plans for our child
14/1/24, 1:02 PM - +263 77 758 4604: Good afternoon team.
14/1/24, 1:03 PM - +263 77 758 4604: I am here to let you know our son Tapiwanashe received his A'level results and he is one point short of minimum 13 points required.

I trust this message finds you well. I am *Ms. Kirti, the Admission Officer at Edoofa.* I would like to inform you that Mr. Shivjeet will no longer be available, as he is advancing in his career with a new opportunity. While his departure is a loss for us, we are also filled with pride and joy for his future endeavors. Moving forward, I will be handling the next steps in your university admission journey and will be directing you in the right direction.
16/1/24, 9:32 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your results, and congratulations on successfully clearing all your A-Level subjects! Your hard work over the past few months has truly paid off.

I am sure your family is immensely proud of your achievements. Your A-level results have been duly noted, and we will quickly add them to your scholarship application. This will enable us to engage in discussions with the academic board and chart the best course of action for your next steps. 

Kindly allow us time to evaluate your results, and plan the way forward Once we have re-evaluated your application, we will be connecting with you.

10/2/24, 10:48 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings Tapiwanashe, 

I trust this message finds you in good health. I am *Ms. Kirti, the Admission officer at Edoofa.*  Today while I was organizing my day, I was going through our records, and I came across your scholarship application and noticed that you were one of the dedicated students who was so keen on pursuing your education abroad. However, because of some situations beyond your control, you were not able to turn your dream into a reality and since then we lost touch with each other.

Hence, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out personally and just check in with you and your family. How have you been doing? Were you able to start your higher education by now, or are you still exploring better opportunities?
10/2/24, 10:50 AM - +263 77 758 4604: Good morning
10/2/24, 10:52 AM - +263 77 758 4604: Yes we have noticed Edoofa has actual exhausted all chances of assisting us. So we are looking at other opportunities that will help us. Thank you for your concern, if we do not find any solution we will pursue other avenues or look for a position next year again
