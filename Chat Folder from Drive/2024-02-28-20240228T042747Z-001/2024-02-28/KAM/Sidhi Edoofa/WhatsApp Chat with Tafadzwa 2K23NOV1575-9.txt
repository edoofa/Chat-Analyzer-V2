*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
28/12/23, 8:32 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.

Could you kindly suggest a 1-hour slot between 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM when we can have our sessions?
27/1/24, 2:22 PM - +263 77 532 6491: We will hear from Tafadzwa her comfortable time which suits her school timetable as she is finishing school at 4pm
27/1/24, 3:06 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: In her absence, you can participate in the session on her behalf as her parent as well. Could you kindly let me know of your availability?
27/1/24, 3:37 PM - +263 77 246 9142: We can schedule 1400hrs to 1600hr CAT
27/1/24, 4:38 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that. In such a case, we will conclude today's conversation and reconnect on Monday at 2:00 PM to further discuss the application process and financial plan. Until then, please take care and kindly extend my regards to your family as well. <This message was edited>
27/1/24, 4:45 PM - +263 77 246 9142: Thank you!
27/1/24, 4:46 PM - +263 77 246 9142: It was a pleasure to be with you in the last session. Let reconnect Monday as agreed
27/1/24, 8:32 PM - +263 71 544 0530: Good evening Miss Siddhi Singh. Sorry for not being able to be available for the session. There was a power cut in my area
29/1/24, 2:01 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Tafadzwa. I hope you are all doing well. How has your day been going so far?
29/1/24, 2:17 PM - +263 77 246 9142: Good afternoon Ma'am. The day has been fine so far
29/1/24, 2:45 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to know that. During our last conversation, we discussed how you have gone through the videos with Edoofa's founders' message. Could you kindly share a brief understanding of the same?
29/1/24, 2:58 PM - +263 77 246 9142: Certainly. I can do that
29/1/24, 3:11 PM - +263 77 246 9142: The videos cover a wide range of issues that include the Edoofa scholarship program and the process of earning credits.

The vision and mission of the program is also given so as the attributes expected of the prospective students

Universities under the Edoofa scholarship program are also discuss ed

The SOP...this one was new to me Statement of Purpose. I am still to adopt it as the abbreviation SOP means Standard Operating Procedure in the industry I work
29/1/24, 3:46 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Brilliant. I am glad to know that you were able to go through the videos so thoroughly and were able to grasp the founders' message. Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  I hope you were able to follow through with this?
29/1/24, 4:06 PM - +263 77 246 9142: I understand the SOP as a subjective document to convince the Admissions team so as the prospective university on why a student should purse program chosen. It will highlight skills, strengths and progress in academic studies
29/1/24, 4:28 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is very correct. Glad to hear that. Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by tomorrow before our session.
29/1/24, 4:28 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

https://goo.gl/forms/iWss6zPuOFbnGTXK2
29/1/24, 4:28 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 2. I am sharing two documents with you. Kindly go through both documents and submit your responses to the course document here in the group. Make sure you research well before starting the task. All the best!
29/1/24, 4:29 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/1/24, 4:29 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/1/24, 4:29 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Once you share these documents and complete the two tasks that have been provided to you, we will have completed the second step of your university admission process. At that point, we will be prepared to move on to the third step, which involves Introduction to the Financial Secure Plan. Hence, could you kindly confirm when you will be able to complete these tasks and reconnect with us? This will allow us to schedule our discussion accordingly.
29/1/24, 4:31 PM - +263 77 246 9142: We will go through this in the evening. Hopefully we will have Tafadzwa s input also. I will now be traveling going home from 1630hrs but my wife will be online if there is still more for today. <This message was edited>
29/1/24, 5:10 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is quite alright. In such a case, we will conclude today's conversation and reconnect tomorrow at 2:00 PM in order to further proceed with our discussion. I hope that by then you will be able to complete these tasks and share them with me. Until then, please take care and have a blessed day ahead!
30/1/24, 2:30 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Tafadzwa. I hope everything is well on your end. How are you all doing today?
30/1/24, 2:57 PM - +263 77 246 9142: Good afternoon Ma'am. We all fine, thank you for checking on us! How are you. Sorry for late response I was in a meeting at work but now we can proceed
30/1/24, 3:01 PM - +263 77 246 9142: Reference to the outstanding task, Tafadzwa is still working on the task and still to provide answers to the questions you send yesterday. She will indicate approximate completion date in the evening.
30/1/24, 3:32 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. In such a case, I will be waiting for Tafadzwa to send in the responses, and in the meanwhile we may proceed with our discussion.
30/1/24, 3:32 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Let us move forward with our discussion. To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is BA LLB and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2025. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
30/1/24, 3:45 PM - +263 77 246 9142: This information is very correct
30/1/24, 4:30 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. Based on our experience of over 14 years and having assisted over 5000 students from different countries, we have realized that financial planning is the most important factor when a student plans for their higher education abroad.
30/1/24, 4:30 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am sure that you must be aware that 20-30% of students who are admitted into universities abroad are unable to fulfill their dream and come to India due to a lack of financial planning. The funds needed for booking flights, accommodation, and covering living expenses after arrival often become overwhelming, leading to the decision to defer their admission for a year. This, in turn, creates a gap in the child's education.
30/1/24, 4:30 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: To assist both students and parents in this regard, Edoofa Management has designed a Financial Secure Plan that aims to help you prepare for your higher educational finances without experiencing stress or last-minute rushes. I believe you must be wondering about the details of the same plan and how it helps the parents?
30/1/24, 4:40 PM - +263 77 246 9142: WE will be grateful to get the details of this financial plan to help us prepare
30/1/24, 5:35 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Edoofa Secure Plan is important for parents who have children joining the university for tertiary education in the next one to two years for several reasons:
30/1/24, 5:35 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 1. *Financial Preparedness:* The Edoofa Secure plan helps parents prepare financially for the costs after the Scholarship being offered so that they are not caught off guard.

2. *Reduced Financial Stress:* Having the Edoofa Secure Plan in place can significantly reduce the financial stress on you as parents when your child is about to enter university. Knowing that there is a dedicated fund for education expenses provides peace of mind.
30/1/24, 5:35 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 3. *Avoiding Debt*: Without proper savings, some parents may resort to taking out loans or accumulating credit card debt to cover their child's education costs. This Educational savings plan helps avoid the burden of debt and high-interest payments.

4. *Compound Interest:* By starting to save early and consistently contributing to the savings plan, parents can take advantage of compound interest, which can significantly increase the amount available for education expenses.
30/1/24, 5:35 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 5. *Flexibility and Control:* The Edoofa Secure savings plans allow parents to have greater control over their finances and how they allocate funds for their child's education. They can choose investment options that align with their risk tolerance and financial goals.

6. *Encouraging Responsibility*: Involving your child in the process of saving for their education teaches them financial responsibility and the value of higher education. It also motivates them to outperform in Academics.
30/1/24, 5:35 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 7. *Adapting to Unexpected Changes*: Life is full of surprises, and circumstances can change especially when there are political reforms changing each day impacting the Local Currency. Having an Edoofa Secure Plan allows parents to adapt to unexpected changes in their financial situation while still prioritizing their child's education.

8. *Peace of Mind:* Overall, having the Edoofa Secure plan provides parents with peace of mind, knowing that they are actively planning for their child's future and increasing the likelihood of providing them with a solid education.
30/1/24, 5:35 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, when you go through all the above benefits, I am sure you can see that the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan is an important financial tool for parents/students who are supposed to enter the university soon. 

It helps ensure that the financial aspect of tertiary education is well-managed, reduces stress, and allows parents to provide the best opportunities for their children without resorting to debt or financial hardship. Isn't this something you and your family also wish to have?
30/1/24, 5:57 PM - +263 77 532 6491: Good day .The financial secure plan we were aware of is EWYL program which Tafadzwa wish to participate in.
30/1/24, 6:24 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. I would love to continue with our discussion, however, my operational hours for the day have concluded. Let us reconnect tomorrow at our scheduled time to further discuss the admission process. I wish you a blessed day ahead!
31/1/24, 2:03 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Tafadzwa.

I hope you are having a wonderful day! To answer your query about the EWYL program, I would like to inform you that the Edoofa team was involved in organising and industrial event for our students of Edoofa who are present here in India. I have a few exciting details to share about the same, and we will talk about it in detail in the upcoming days. Due to this, we were unable to initiate the scheduled EWYL lessons. Be rest assured, now that we are connected Tafadzwa's EWYL journey will commence soon and I will share an update regarding the same to you. <This message was edited>
31/1/24, 2:12 PM - +263 77 246 9142: Good afternoon Ma'am. It's has been a pleasant day. Thank you for clarifying on the EWYL journey
31/1/24, 2:34 PM - +263 77 246 9142: On going through the Edoofa financial secure plan ...I see it is an important tool to have. Please provide more details
31/1/24, 2:59 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, as you are aware, we are currently in January 2024, and we have a good 20 months to plan for your finances before you start your university education in 2025.
31/1/24, 2:59 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: During the counseling session, you were informed that at Edoofa, we guarantee a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship on the tuition fees. Hence, the cost of education, including food and accommodation after the scholarship, would be between $2000-$3000, and it could be even less. Not more than that.
31/1/24, 2:59 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This means that if you can save $150 per month for the next 20 months, you will be able to save $3000. This amount is more than enough for the first year of university fees, including tuition fees (if any), food, and accommodation. I hope you agree with this?
31/1/24, 3:27 PM - +263 77 246 9142: Brilliant idea. I do agree...but I should check whether the finances allow us to start immediately
31/1/24, 4:26 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Right, this means that by the time you would be in India, you would have already saved the $3000 that will cover the first-year fee.
31/1/24, 4:26 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, in these next 20 months, I am sure you would also be engaged in the EWYL program, and if you secure a minimum of $1000 in 20 months, that means the fees for 1.5 years are already secured.
31/1/24, 4:26 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, for a 3-year course, if we follow the same approach for the remaining 1.5 years, the educational journey for the student and the financial journey for the parent will be easy and smooth. I believe you must be able to see this perspective?
1/2/24, 2:23 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Tafadzwa.

I hope you are having a great day. I was hoping to get a response from your end yesterday, but it seems like due to some reason we were unable to connect. I just wanted to check in on you and your family. How are you all doing today?
1/2/24, 2:52 PM - +263 77 246 9142: Good afternoon Ma'am.  It's been a beautiful day since morning.  We are all fine. Sorry for failure to respond yesterday. I finish work at 1630hrs CAT thus between that time and about 1730hrs I will be on my way home.  I assume by that time it will be outside your working hours.  Please advise if it is fine to send responses outside your working hours
1/2/24, 2:54 PM - +263 77 246 9142: Reference to tasks which Tafadzwa is supposed to respond. She indicated to me that she was still working on the questions. She has completed question 1 which I will forward her response to that question
1/2/24, 2:54 PM - +263 77 246 9142: This message was deleted
1/2/24, 2:55 PM - +263 77 246 9142: <Media omitted>
1/2/24, 3:03 PM - +263 77 246 9142: This is very clear but I am bit lost of the costs

1. Educational fees (tuition
2. Food and accomodation
3. Air fares

How the EWYL program will work and onto which figure?

The money which we have to raise on a monthly basis, what will it be assuming the EWYL affords Tafadzwa for example 100%
2/2/24, 2:33 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Tafadzwa.

I hope you are having a wonderful day. Thank you for letting me know about your situation. I understand please. You can share your responses any time during the day, that is not a problem, and I will respond to you during my operational hours.
2/2/24, 2:39 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Through the EWYL program, the student earns scholarship credits that can be used against his university fees. Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
2/2/24, 2:39 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn.
2/2/24, 2:39 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. I hope you have understood this?
2/2/24, 3:31 PM - +263 77 532 6491: Yes we have understood.it is a brilliant idea
2/2/24, 3:32 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that we are on the same page here. May I know if Tafadzwa was able to complete the rest of the task?
2/2/24, 3:38 PM - +263 77 246 9142: Good afternoon. We are fine and hope the same applies to you. Thank you for clarifying issues. We have understood and we can proceed with the next steps. Tafadzwa has indicated she will post the reminder of the question's responses today later in the evening
2/2/24, 4:27 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. I am fine too, thank you for asking. Alright please, I understand. In such a case, let us move forward with our discussion.
2/2/24, 4:27 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: With that said, there is also another benefit, I am sure being in Zimbabwe you know how drastically the exchange rate fluctuates.
2/2/24, 4:27 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: If you are buying a dollar today, you might be spending 7000 bonds, but if you buy a dollar after a month, the rate would be different.
2/2/24, 4:27 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Also, even if you choose to buy dollars every month and save at your home, it is not safe since there is news of robbery, and mugging every day.
2/2/24, 4:27 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: In that case, you will opt to save in the Bank, but again we know that savings in the Bank require a Nostro Account which means you have to pay the bank to keep your money safe, right?
3/2/24, 11:41 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Tafadzwa. How are you all doing this fine morning?
3/2/24, 11:46 AM - +263 71 544 0530: Good how are you
3/2/24, 12:02 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. I am well too, thank you for asking. Since we could not connect further yesterday, may I know if you were able to go through my last few messages form yesterday?
3/2/24, 12:10 PM - +263 77 532 6491: Can we connect on Monday please at the moment we are taking my father to the Hospital.the sugar and blood pressure levels have gone above limits
3/2/24, 12:30 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Most definitely we can. I am so sorry to hear that. Please take care of your father. I will pray for his speedy recovery.

Let us conclude our discussion here for today, and we will reconnect on Monday to further proceed with our discussion.

Until then, please take care and I will pray for you and your family's well being.
4/2/24, 7:48 PM - +263 71 544 0530: Good evening.
Question 2.
Please elaborate on the difference between rights and duties and give a further explanation of the difference in Human rights and civil rights.

Rights and duties are two components that are closely related but have different implications in a legal and ethical context. Rights are things that people are entitled to or freedoms that individuals possess which are protected and upheld by law. These include the right to life, liberty and security, the right to freedom of speech and expression and the right to a free trial. Rights are often seen as the inherent to human beings that are typically enrished in constitutions, international treaties and other legal instruments. Duties on the other hand are things that people are obligated to do. Duties reflect the responsibilities that individuals and institutions are expected to fulfil in order to maintain a just and orderly society. For example, citizens may have a duty to obey the laws, pay taxes or contribute to the welfare of the community. Duties are often tied to the idea of social and civic responsibility and they are crucial for the functioning of a harmonious and cooperative society.
4/2/24, 8:07 PM - +263 71 544 0530: Question 3.
What is the difference between a prosecutor and an attorney?

A prosecutor and an attorney are both lawyers, but have different roles in the legal system.

A prosecutor, also known as a district attorney or state attorney, is a lawyer who represents the government in criminal cases. Their main job is to prosecute individuals accused of committing crimes. Prosecutors work for the state or federal government and are responsible for presenting evidence, arguing in court, and seeking to prove that the defendant is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. Their goal is to seek justice for the community and to ensure that criminals are held accountable for their actions.

On the other hand, an attorney, also known as a defense attorney or defense lawyer, represents individuals accused of committing crimes. Attorneys work on behalf of their clients to defend them against criminal charges brought by the government. They advocate for their clients’ rights, challenge the evidence presented by the prosecution, and work to achieve the best possible outcome for their clients, whether that be reduced charges, a plea deal, or a full acquittal at trial.
5/2/24, 2:10 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Tafadzwa.

I hope everything is well on your end. How are you all doing today and how is your father's condition? I hope that he is doing better.
5/2/24, 2:21 PM - +263 77 532 6491: Good afternoon
5/2/24, 2:21 PM - +263 77 532 6491: My father is far much better today.the sugar level is better today compared to yesterday
5/2/24, 2:27 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am happy to hear that he is doing better now. Could you kindly share your answers for the rest of the questions and the screenshot of the SOP form @263715440530 ?
5/2/24, 2:40 PM - +263 77 532 6491: She is at school right now when she comes back she will finish the rest.
5/2/24, 2:57 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. In such a case, I will look forward to getting an update from your end about the task. In the meanwhile, let us move forward with our discussion. During our last session, we discussed about the various constraints that parents and students tend to face in their higher education journey. Considering these constraints, Edoofa Management has decided to help the parents and students prepare for the journey way ahead of time by helping them save money with Edoofa without any additional charges but rather saving additional money as well. Do you want me to explain how this has been achieved?
5/2/24, 4:30 PM - +263 77 246 9142: Good afternoon Ma'am
5/2/24, 4:30 PM - +263 77 246 9142: How is that done. Please elaborate?
5/2/24, 5:03 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Program Fee (Enrollment Fee) that you were asked to pay is $350. Under the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan, a parent has to deposit a small amount of money which is $150 every month for the next 10 months. That means, in 10 months, the money saved will be $1500.
5/2/24, 5:04 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That means, in 10 months, the money saved will be $1500. When this money is saved, Edoofa will waive off $150 from the Edoofa Program/Enrollment Fee of $350, thereby making a straight saving of $150 in 10 months.
5/2/24, 5:04 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Imagine you paying $15 every month to the Bank of Zimbabwe to keep your money safe, and here Edoofa is paying you $15 every month to keep your money safe. Now, you must be wondering, why only for 10 months and not for 20 months, right?
5/2/24, 8:45 PM - +263 71 544 0530: Question 4.
Which branch of law are you interested in pursuing, Civil, corporate and criminal law and why?

I am interested in pursuing criminal law because I would like to defend individuals accused of crimes and ensure that their rights are protected and also making impact on client's lives by providing them with legal representation and advocate for fair treatment in court . I'm also interested in criminal law because of the high demand of criminal lawyers because crimes are happening everyday. This demand can provide job security and a steady flow of clients. I am also interested in criminal law because of the potential for high earnings and also because successful criminal lawyers may also be able to build a strong reputation and attract a steady stream of clients.
5/2/24, 9:15 PM - +263 71 544 0530: Question 5.
What skills do you believe you have that will make you a successful lawyer, please elaborate with an example.

I believe that I can be a successful lawyer because I have strong analytical skills. At school I am into the debate club and that has helped enhance my analytical skills because debate is based on critical analysis and arguments. I also have excellent communication skills. The public speaking and debate sessions that I attend also enhance my communication skills because In debate we are taught how to present arguments and how to negotiate with the opposing parties. I also believe that I have research and writing skills and I'm also a wife reader and this can help me in becoming a successful lawyer. I also believe that I have interpersonal skills and emotional intelligence and this is because I do Sociology at school and we do researchs using interviews and that has helped enhance my interpersonal skills to build rapport with the people i will be conducting researches on
6/2/24, 2:06 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Tafadzwa.

I hope you are all doing wonderful today. Thank you for sharing the rest 2 answers with me. May I know if you were also able to fill the online SOP form that I shared with you previously? <This message was edited>
6/2/24, 2:17 PM - +263 77 246 9142: Good afternoon Ma'am. Currently working on the SOP. And hope to complete soon
6/2/24, 2:34 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. Thank you for letting me know that. Kindly let me know once you are able to complete the form, in the meanwhile, if you are ready, shall we proceed with our discussion regarding the Financial Secure Plan?
6/2/24, 2:37 PM - +263 77 246 9142: <Media omitted>
6/2/24, 2:38 PM - +263 77 246 9142: Please proceed with the FS plan
6/2/24, 2:38 PM - +263 77 246 9142: I have attached a pic of the SOP response record
6/2/24, 2:51 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the screenshot with me. I have duly taken a note of it. Following our previous discussion, you must be wondering, why only for 10 months and not for 20 months, right?
6/2/24, 2:51 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: If you see the bigger picture, you will realize that the reason is quite simple. Upon the completion of the 10 installments, the Edoofa Admissions team will initiate the Child’s Admission Process by applying early to the universities to secure their scholarship and their university seat.
6/2/24, 2:51 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Reserving seats earlier increases the chances of obtaining a maximum scholarship. A higher scholarship means lower fees, and by securing the seat, you will be entitled to pay the fees as per the old fee structure of the university, not the new one implemented in January 2025. Furthermore, when applying to the universities, you will receive an offer letter or a letter of intent detailing the fees, scholarship, and registration fees.
6/2/24, 2:51 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: As explained during the enrollment process, the registration fee is a portion of your first-year university fee, paid to reserve the seat. It ranges from $500-$1000 and is not an additional fee. 

From the $1500 you saved with Edoofa, the registration fee will be paid to the university, securing the seat. For instance, if the registration fee is $1000, Edoofa will pay $1000 from the $1500 saved in 10 months. The updated balance with Edoofa will be $500, which will be paid to the university upon your arrival in India.
6/2/24, 2:51 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This eases the financial burden on the parent, as there is no immediate payment required upon the student's arrival. The $500 saved will cover the remaining fees for the semester/year, as specified in the offer letter from the university. What are your thoughts on this?
6/2/24, 3:08 PM - +263 77 246 9142: This is brilliant idea. I still do not understand which banks will savings be made whether locally or in India.  If India does exchange control regulations allow for it
7/2/24, 11:19 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Tafadzwa

I hope this message finds you well and filled with the same excitement that's buzzing here at Edoofa! It's that time of the year again when we eagerly anticipate our annual Meet and Greet Seminar in Harare. This event holds a special place in our hearts as it brings us closer to our community, and we're counting down the days with great anticipation!
7/2/24, 11:19 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Just like clockwork, we're gearing up for the seminar next week, and I couldn't resist sharing our enthusiasm with you. Your presence would truly make the event all the more meaningful, guiding you on your journey to India. Hence, with immense joy, we wanted to extend the special invitation for the Meet and Greet Seminar to you and your wonderful family.
7/2/24, 11:19 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: And in the process of doing the same, I happened to notice that you haven't started your EWYL Program by now. In light of this, I had a discussion with Ms. Sanjana, the head of the EWYL Department, and I am happy to share that she has graciously agreed to make a special exception for you, expediting your application process.
7/2/24, 11:19 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: As a result, I have gone ahead and created your very own dedicated EWYL Group - *Tafadzwa EWYL23E0987*, adding both you and your parents to the mix. If I have missed including any other family members, they can easily join using the following link: [https://chat.whatsapp.com/GFV6IBFGMza43OujctFdmZ].

Within the group, the EWYL team will not only guide you on the hows and whens of the EWYL Program but also share all the exciting details about the upcoming Meet and Greet Seminar in Harare. We are genuinely thrilled to witness you embark on this transformative journey, and we are rooting for your success every step of the way!

Warmest regards,
Admissions Team.
7/2/24, 11:21 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand your concern please. The deposits can be made by you locally as well as by international transfer. We have some of our associates living in Zimbabwe and through them you can make your payment locally.
7/2/24, 1:58 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon once again.

It is now time for our session. May I know if you were able to go through my previous messages?
7/2/24, 2:14 PM - +263 77 246 9142: Good afternoon. I confirm having gone through your messages which are clear. I clearly understand. We have also joined the EWYL group save for Tafadzwa  who will join later
7/2/24, 2:29 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that, sir. Allow me to proceed with our discussion regarding the Financial Secure Plan. With this plan for the next 10 months, I am sure you must be wondering what will happen in the next 10 months, considering you have already secured your scholarship seat with the university due to your hard work in the first 10 months. Is my understanding correct?
7/2/24, 3:57 PM - +263 77 246 9142: You are right, please explain further
7/2/24, 4:30 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Let me help you with that as well. In the 11th month, you will be guided to open an FBC Mastercard bank account in Zimbabwe with a deposit of $150. The reason for this is that when you apply for your student Visa, the Embassy asks for a Bank Statement, and this account will serve that purpose.
7/2/24, 4:30 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: We understand it might be expensive if you deposit another $1500 for the remaining 10 months in FB  Bank Zimbabwe, so to avoid the same challenges, we have designed the plan accordingly. You will only be depositing for the 11th, 12th, 13th, and 14th month, which is 4 months.
7/2/24, 4:30 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Once the 4 months are completed, our Department of Student Welfare (DSW) team will assist you with your visa process. The bank statement will act as one of the required documents, and once you receive the visa, you can withdraw the amount from FBC and book the flight ticket. This will help you utilize the money as well. How does it sound?
7/2/24, 6:30 PM - +263 77 246 9142: This sounds good and perfect. How much on average is the airfare to India from Zimbabwe
8/2/24, 1:54 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Tafadzwa.

I hope you are having a wonderful day. I was unable to respond to your last message as our operational hours had already concluded. To answer your query, the airfare costs $400 to $500 on average.
8/2/24, 1:54 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, from the 16th Month till the 20th month, considering it is a 6-month window, you can again continue depositing the money ($150) with Edoofa which can be used in the fee as and when required or you can decide to save this $900 of these 6 months with you as well. This is something which you are free to choose. I hope you have understood the financial secure plan now?
8/2/24, 1:58 PM - +263 77 246 9142: Good afternoon. Thank you for the explanation. I understand and look forward to meeting the secure plan requirements
8/2/24, 2:29 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That's great. Now that you have all the information, I want you to take some time and discuss the financial security plan with your family members. Help them understand its importance and details. Once you're done, we can reconnect, have a discussion, and address any queries you may have. After resolving your concerns, I'll guide you through starting your financial security plan. 

While most people can discuss this with their family the same day, I understand everyone is different. Could you let me know when you think you'll have the discussion with your family? This way, we can schedule our next session accordingly.
8/2/24, 3:00 PM - +263 77 246 9142: Many thanks for all the information.  We definitely need time to discuss and agree on how we will handle this plan. My wife is currently attending to her father in Glendale 60km north of Harare.I think we should be able to reconnect on this next week Wednesday 14 Feb.
8/2/24, 3:34 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I completely understand your perspective. Making decisions about the plan requires thorough discussion and consideration, especially involving your wife to ensure clarity on all aspects. In light of this, let's schedule a follow-up discussion for next Wednesday. This should allow you ample time to discuss the plan with your wife and reach a conclusion together.

I will look forward to reconnecting with you next week. Have a blessed week ahead and kindly extend my regards to your family as well.

27/2/24, 3:12 PM - +263 77 246 9142: We discussed about the secure plan and agreed it's a noble idea. At first we failed to understand but after explanation at the Meet n Greet session we understood fully .

27/2/24, 5:15 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: The amount is $150 for your monthly installments. Additionally, if you have a surplus budget exceeding $150 in any given month, you have the option to deposit that amount, which will then be adjusted with your subsequent deposits. For instance, if you deposit $200 in March, your next payment due in April will be adjusted to $100.
