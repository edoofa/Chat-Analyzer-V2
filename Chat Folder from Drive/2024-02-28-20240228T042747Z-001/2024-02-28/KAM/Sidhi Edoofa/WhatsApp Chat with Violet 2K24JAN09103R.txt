It has been a week since we began our admission process, and it seems like due to some challenges we are unable to connect with each other and move forward.

In order to ensure that, we need to cooperate and work together. May I know if you are facing any challenges that are causing a hindrance in our schedule?

I hope you are doing well. How is everything on your end?

8/2/24, 9:21 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. I want to kindly inquire about the reason for your absence from our scheduled session yesterday. Your participation is crucial for our progress, and understanding any challenges you faced will help us ensure smoother coordination in the future.
8/2/24, 10:19 AM - +263 78 199 1982: I had tests the whole day so l didn't have time for the session
8/2/24, 10:34 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. Your proactive engagement is crucial, and if you or your guardians won't be available for any reason, please inform us in advance so that we can plan and schedule accordingly.

Moving forward, may I know if you were able to join your EWYL group Violet?
8/2/24, 11:53 AM - +263 78 199 1982: Yes l joined it
8/2/24, 12:10 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that, Violet. During our session on Monday, I had shared 4 videos with you. May I know if you were able to go through all of them?
8/2/24, 12:26 PM - +263 78 199 1982: Yes l did
8/2/24, 12:38 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Could you kindly share your understanding of the 4 videos?
8/2/24, 1:46 PM - +263 78 199 1982: In short let me just say l have learnt about schools, colleges and universities on the Edoofa platform and the experiences students are having in these schools
8/2/24, 1:50 PM - +263 78 199 1982: I have also learnt about character of a good and successful student which distinguishes her from the world
8/2/24, 2:22 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. Let me share my views as well so that it will help you expand your understanding.

*Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students:* In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. 

You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent.
8/2/24, 2:22 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s vision for you:* Here our founders talk about the most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of tomorrow.
8/2/24, 2:22 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program:* Talking about the third video, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
8/2/24, 2:22 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP:* Another thing is that Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based. 

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
8/2/24, 2:23 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose. I hope you were able to follow through with this?
8/2/24, 3:30 PM - +263 78 199 1982: Yes
8/2/24, 3:50 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Glad to hear that. Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by tomorrow before our session.
8/2/24, 3:50 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

https://goo.gl/forms/iWss6zPuOFbnGTXK2
8/2/24, 3:53 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 2. I am sharing two documents with you. Kindly go through both documents and submit your responses to the course document here in the group. Make sure you research well before starting the task. All the best!
8/2/24, 3:53 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
8/2/24, 3:53 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
8/2/24, 4:46 PM - +263 78 199 1982: Ok
8/2/24, 5:14 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Along with these tasks, I want you to share the following documents with us as they are required for your university application preparation:

*1. A-Level Result or Letter of Recommendation or Statement of Entry (A-Level).*

*2. O-Level Results*

*3. Identity proof (International Traveling Passport or National ID or Birth Certificate)*
8/2/24, 5:14 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Moving forward, as a part of your application file, you will need to visit your school and secure a letter of recommendation from them. We have attached a sample document to help guide you through the process.
8/2/24, 5:14 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
8/2/24, 5:14 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Here are some key points to consider when requesting the letter from your school:

1. *Visit Your School*: Approach your school administration or the designated authority for issuing such letters.

2. *Provide Necessary Information*: Ensure that the drafted letter includes essential details such as your identity as a student of the school, *your subject combination for A Level exams*, and your intention to sit for the exams this academic year.

3. *Printing and Signing*: Request the school to print the letter on official letterhead and have it signed/stamped by the appropriate authority.

4. *Include Authority Details*: Ensure that the letter contains the details of the signing authority, including their full name, contact number, and email ID.
8/2/24, 5:14 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This letter of recommendation is a crucial document that will support your application process. The Edoofa Academic Board will use those details to reach out to your school authorities and verify the recommendation letter before adding it to your scholarship application and hence I would like to inquire by when will you be able to share the same document with us?
8/2/24, 5:24 PM - +263 78 199 1982: I will give you the documents on Sunday
8/2/24, 5:45 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that. Once you share these documents and complete the two tasks that have been provided to you, we will have completed the second step of your university admission process. At that point, we will be prepared to move on to the third step, which involves Introduction to the Financial Secure Plan. Hence, could you kindly confirm when you will be able to complete these tasks and reconnect with us? This will allow us to schedule our discussion accordingly.
8/2/24, 6:05 PM - +263 78 199 1982: I will be done with the tasks on Sunday as well
9/2/24, 10:07 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Violet.

I trust you've had a productive day thus far. It's time for our scheduled session. Before we dive in, I just wanted to check in and ask how you're doing today. How's everything on your end?
9/2/24, 10:10 AM - +263 78 199 1982: Am fine and everything is good
9/2/24, 10:23 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. I understand that you will be able to share the documents by Sunday. May I know if you have completed the 2 tasks I had shared with you?
9/2/24, 10:26 AM - +263 78 199 1982: Today lm a bit tied up with school work can l please submit the tasks tomorrow
9/2/24, 11:10 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand, Violet. Given that our admission process commenced on January 23 and we're currently behind schedule, I kindly urge your prompt attention to complete the pending tasks. They should take approximately 30 to 45 minutes. Could you confirm if it's feasible for you to finish these tasks by 4:00 PM today? This would enable us to proceed with our session as planned.
9/2/24, 12:41 PM - +263 78 199 1982: Ok l will do so
9/2/24, 1:34 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that. In such a case, let us reconnect at 4:00 PM today, and I hope that by then you will be able to complete the tasks that I had previously shared with you.
9/2/24, 2:02 PM - +263 78 199 1982: <Media omitted>
9/2/24, 2:03 PM - +263 78 199 1982: 2)A right is something a person is entitled to, while a duty is something that a person is obligated to do.
Human rights are rights that belong to every person simply because they are human. They are universal and inalienable meaning that they can not be  taken away. Civil rights, on the other hand, are rights that a granted to individuals by a government or other authority. They may vary from country to country, and can be granted or taken away by government.

3)A prosecuter is a lawyer who works for the government to enforce the law and prosecute those who are accused of crimes. An attorney, on the other hand, is a lawyer who represents a client in a legal matter.

4)I prefer criminal law. This is so because i have the desire to help people who have been accused of crimes, and to make sure they are treated fairly by the justice system. Another reason , criminal law is important for maintaining order and protecting the society. It can also be a challenging and rewarding field with many  opportunities for career growth and advancement.

5)First and foremost, i am an excellent communicator. Additionally i am good at problem solving and a critical thinker. I can analyze complex issues and come up with creative solutions. I proved these skills many times through debating and public speaking.
9/2/24, 2:21 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your answers with me Violet. May I know if you were also able to fill the online SOP form?
9/2/24, 2:22 PM - +263 78 199 1982: Im on it
9/2/24, 2:58 PM - +263 78 199 1982: I have filled the online SOS form
9/2/24, 3:49 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for informing me, Violet. Could you kindly share a screenshot of the page that appears after you submit the online Google form?
9/2/24, 7:05 PM - +263 78 199 1982: <Media omitted>
9/2/24, 7:08 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the screenshot of the SOP form. I would like to continue with our discussion, however, as my operational hours have come to an end, let's conclude our conversation here. We will reconnect tomorrow for our next session. Our operational hours for tomorrow (Saturday) are from 8:00 AM to 1:00 PM. I hope you'll be available during this time for further discussion.

I will look forward to our session tomorrow. Have a blessed night!
9/2/24, 7:10 PM - +263 78 199 1982: Ok..good night
10/2/24, 1:13 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Violet.

I trust you are having a delightful weekend. On this pleasant Saturday afternoon, I hope you are presently available for a discussion. Before we begin, I would like to check in and ask how are things with you today?
10/2/24, 1:14 PM - +263 78 199 1982: Everything is good
10/2/24, 1:36 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey, i.e. *Introduction to Financial Secure Plan*.
10/2/24, 1:37 PM - +263 78 199 1982: Ok
10/2/24, 2:36 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: However, before we start the same, I was going through your scholarship application file and noticed that you are supposed to make the payment of your remaining part of Edoofa Enrollment fee. Hence, I thought of sharing a gentle reminder with you and trying to understand how your preparation has been so far? Have you been able to align your preparations in the right direction?
10/2/24, 3:09 PM - +263 78 199 1982: yes
10/2/24, 3:51 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. We will reconnect with each other a few days before your due date to take a follow up on this and understand your preparations better. 

In the meantime, Let us move forward with our discussion. To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is BA LLB and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2025. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
10/2/24, 3:53 PM - +263 78 199 1982: Yes thats correct
10/2/24, 3:54 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. Based on our experience of over 14 years and having assisted over 5000 students from different countries, we have realized that financial planning is the most important factor when a student plans for their higher education abroad.
10/2/24, 3:54 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am sure that you must be aware that 20-30% of students who are admitted into universities abroad are unable to fulfill their dream and come to India due to a lack of financial planning. The funds needed for booking flights, accommodation, and covering living expenses after arrival often become overwhelming, leading to the decision to defer their admission for a year. This, in turn, creates a gap in the child's education.
10/2/24, 3:54 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: To assist both students and parents in this regard, Edoofa Management has designed a Financial Secure Plan that aims to help you prepare for your higher educational finances without experiencing stress or last-minute rushes. I believe you must be wondering about the details of the same plan and how it helps the parents?
10/2/24, 4:00 PM - +263 78 199 1982: Yes ln eager to learn about it
12/2/24, 7:44 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Violet.

I hope you had a wonderful weekend. During our previous session, we were discussing about the types of constraints students and their parents face while planning for their child's higher education abroad. Before we proceed with our session today, I would like to inquire, how are things on your end this fine morning?
12/2/24, 8:00 AM - +263 78 199 1982: Everything is alright
12/2/24, 8:46 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that Violet. Continuing our previous discussion, Edoofa Secure Plan is important for parents who have children joining the university for tertiary education in the next one to two years for several reasons:
12/2/24, 8:46 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: 1. *Financial Preparedness:* The Edoofa Secure plan helps parents prepare financially for the costs after the Scholarship being offered so that they are not caught off guard.

2. *Reduced Financial Stress:* Having the Edoofa Secure Plan in place can significantly reduce the financial stress on you as parents when your child is about to enter university. Knowing that there is a dedicated fund for education expenses provides peace of mind.
12/2/24, 8:46 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: 3. *Avoiding Debt*: Without proper savings, some parents may resort to taking out loans or accumulating credit card debt to cover their child's education costs. This Educational savings plan helps avoid the burden of debt and high-interest payments.

4. *Compound Interest:* By starting to save early and consistently contributing to the savings plan, parents can take advantage of compound interest, which can significantly increase the amount available for education expenses.
12/2/24, 8:46 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: 5. *Flexibility and Control:* The Edoofa Secure savings plans allow parents to have greater control over their finances and how they allocate funds for their child's education. They can choose investment options that align with their risk tolerance and financial goals.

6. *Encouraging Responsibility*: Involving your child in the process of saving for their education teaches them financial responsibility and the value of higher education. It also motivates them to outperform in Academics.
12/2/24, 8:46 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: 7. *Adapting to Unexpected Changes*: Life is full of surprises, and circumstances can change especially when there are political reforms changing each day impacting the Local Currency. Having an Edoofa Secure Plan allows parents to adapt to unexpected changes in their financial situation while still prioritizing their child's education.

8. *Peace of Mind:* Overall, having the Edoofa Secure plan provides parents with peace of mind, knowing that they are actively planning for their child's future and increasing the likelihood of providing them with a solid education.
12/2/24, 8:46 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, when you go through all the above benefits, I am sure you can see that the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan is an important financial tool for parents/students who are supposed to enter the university soon. 

It helps ensure that the financial aspect of tertiary education is well-managed, reduces stress, and allows parents to provide the best opportunities for their children without resorting to debt or financial hardship. Isn't this something you and your family also wish to have?
12/2/24, 8:53 AM - +263 78 199 1982: Indeed, it is something we have always been wishing for all along
12/2/24, 9:00 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through the above points, do you want me to help you understand how the Edoofa Secure Plan works?
12/2/24, 9:01 AM - +263 78 199 1982: Yes
12/2/24, 9:26 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, as you are aware, we are currently in February 2024, and we have a good 20 months to plan for your finances before you start your university education in 2025.
12/2/24, 9:26 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: During the counseling session, you were informed that at Edoofa, we guarantee a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship on the tuition fees. Hence, the cost of education, including food and accommodation after the scholarship, would be between $2000-$3000, and it could be even less. Not more than that.
12/2/24, 9:26 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: This means that if you can save $150 per month for the next 20 months, you will be able to save $3000. This amount is more than enough for the first year of university fees, including tuition fees (if any), food, and accommodation. I hope you agree with this?
12/2/24, 9:30 AM - +263 78 199 1982: Yes l do
12/2/24, 9:33 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Right, this means that by the time you would be in India, you would have already saved the $3000 that will cover the first-year fee.
12/2/24, 9:33 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, in these next 20 months, I am sure you would also be engaged in the EWYL program, and if you secure a minimum of $1000 in 20 months, that means the fees for 1.5 years are already secured.
12/2/24, 9:33 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, for a 3-year course, if we follow the same approach for the remaining 1.5 years, the educational journey for the student and the financial journey for the parent will be easy and smooth. I believe you must be able to see this perspective?
12/2/24, 9:35 AM - +263 78 199 1982: Yeah l can see it
12/2/24, 9:40 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. With that said, there is also another benefit, I am sure being in Zimbabwe you know how drastically the exchange rate fluctuates.
12/2/24, 9:40 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: If you are buying a dollar today, you might be spending 7000 bonds, but if you buy a dollar after a month, the rate would be different.
12/2/24, 9:40 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Also, even if you choose to buy dollars every month and save at your home, it is not safe since there is news of robbery, and mugging every day.
12/2/24, 9:40 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: In that case, you will opt to save in the Bank, but again we know that savings in the Bank require a Nostro Account which means you have to pay the bank to keep your money safe, right?
12/2/24, 9:41 AM - +263 78 199 1982: Yes
12/2/24, 10:00 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is great to hear. Considering these constraints, Edoofa Management has decided to help the parents and students prepare for the journey way ahead of time by helping them save money with Edoofa without any additional charges but rather saving additional money as well. Do you want me to explain how this has been achieved?
12/2/24, 10:30 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Before we proceed with our discussion, I would like to take a follow-up on your EWYL group. May I know if you were able to join your group and share the message with your mentor?
12/2/24, 10:34 AM - +263 78 199 1982: Yes please
12/2/24, 10:36 AM - +263 78 199 1982: Yeah l joined but we only had a conversation that day only
12/2/24, 10:58 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. Thank you for letting me know that. Allow me to proceed with our discussion. I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Program Fee (Enrollment Fee) that you were asked to pay is $350. From the $350, you have already paid $200, and the remaining $150 is what you are planning to pay before your due date of February 18, 2024.
12/2/24, 10:58 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Under the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan, a parent has to deposit a small amount of money which is $150 every month for the next 10 months. 

That means, in 10 months, the money saved will be $1500. When this money is saved, Edoofa will waive off the remaining $150 which was due from the Edoofa Program/Enrollment Fee of $350, thereby making a straight saving of $150 in 10 months.
12/2/24, 10:58 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Imagine you paying $15 every month to the Bank of Zimbabwe to keep your money safe, and here Edoofa is paying you $15 every month to keep your money safe. Now, you must be wondering, why only for 10 months and not for 20 months, right?
12/2/24, 12:33 PM - +263 78 199 1982: Yeah
12/2/24, 12:38 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: If you see the bigger picture, you will realize that the reason is quite simple. Upon the completion of the 10 installments, the Edoofa Admissions team will initiate the Child’s Admission Process by applying early to the universities to secure their scholarship and their university seat.
12/2/24, 12:39 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Reserving seats earlier increases the chances of obtaining a maximum scholarship. A higher scholarship means lower fees, and by securing the seat, you will be entitled to pay the fees as per the old fee structure of the university, not the new one implemented in January 2025. Furthermore, when applying to the universities, you will receive an offer letter or a letter of intent detailing the fees, scholarship, and registration fees.
12/2/24, 12:39 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: As explained during the enrollment process, the registration fee is a portion of your first-year university fee, paid to reserve the seat. It ranges from $500-$1000 and is not an additional fee. 

From the $1500 you saved with Edoofa, the registration fee will be paid to the university, securing the seat. For instance, if the registration fee is $1000, Edoofa will pay $1000 from the $1500 saved in 10 months. The updated balance with Edoofa will be $500, which will be paid to the university upon your arrival in India.
12/2/24, 12:39 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This eases the financial burden on the parent, as there is no immediate payment required upon the student's arrival. The $500 saved will cover the remaining fees for the semester/year, as specified in the offer letter from the university. What are your thoughts on this?
12/2/24, 12:50 PM - +263 78 199 1982: This Edoofa Financial Secure is actually good as it financial burden of parents and and makes education quite chewp
12/2/24, 12:50 PM - +263 78 199 1982: Cheap*
12/2/24, 1:34 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to see that we are together so far. With this plan for the next 10 months, I am sure you must be wondering what will happen in the next 10 months, considering you have already secured your scholarship seat with the university due to your hard work in the first 10 months. Is my understanding correct?
12/2/24, 1:36 PM - +263 78 199 1982: Yes thats correct
12/2/24, 2:11 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Let me help you with that as well. In the 11th month, you will be guided to open an FBC Mastercard bank account in Zimbabwe with a deposit of $150. The reason for this is that when you apply for your student Visa, the Embassy asks for a Bank Statement, and this account will serve that purpose.
12/2/24, 2:11 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: We understand it might be expensive if you deposit another $1500 for the remaining 10 months in FB  Bank Zimbabwe, so to avoid the same challenges, we have designed the plan accordingly. You will only be depositing for the 11th, 12th, 13th, and 14th month, which is 4 months.
12/2/24, 2:11 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Once the 4 months are completed, our Department of Student Welfare (DSW) team will assist you with your visa process. The bank statement will act as one of the required documents, and once you receive the visa, you can withdraw the amount from FBC and book the flight ticket. This will help you utilize the money as well. How does it sound?
12/2/24, 2:17 PM - +263 78 199 1982: Its a great idea
12/2/24, 2:49 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, from the 16th Month till the 20th month, considering it is a 6-month window, you can again continue depositing the money ($150) with Edoofa which can be used in the fee as and when required or you can decide to save this $900 of these 6 months with you as well. This is something which you are free to choose. I hope you have understood the financial secure plan now? <This message was edited>
12/2/24, 3:04 PM - +263 78 199 1982: Yes l have understood it
12/2/24, 3:28 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That's great. Now that you have all the information, I want you to take some time and discuss the financial security plan with your family members. Help them understand its importance and details. Once you're done, we can reconnect, have a discussion, and address any queries you may have. After resolving your concerns, I'll guide you through starting your financial security plan. 

While most students can discuss this with their family the same day, I understand everyone is different. Could you let me know when you think you'll have the discussion with your family? This way, we can schedule our next session accordingly.
12/2/24, 4:03 PM - +263 78 199 1982: Today
12/2/24, 4:06 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That's perfectly fine. In that case, we will conclude today's conversation, and I will connect with you tomorrow to resume our discussion. In the meantime, I hope you'll have a detailed discussion with your family and jot down any questions or thoughts you have regarding the Financial Secure plan.

Wishing you a good day ahead, and please extend our regards to your family.
12/2/24, 4:08 PM - +263 78 199 1982: Ok thank you
13/2/24, 9:38 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Violet,

Please, how are you doing today? With regards to our discussion yesterday, I wanted to reach out and enquire if you are available for us to have a brief conversation?
13/2/24, 10:16 AM - +263 78 199 1982: Good morning, Yes lm available
13/2/24, 10:31 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you are available for us to connect with each other. Before reaching out to you today, I was going through pictures and videos from Edoofa's very first SLICE CON held last week, and that sparked my curiosity about whether you are familiar with what SLICE CON is or not?
13/2/24, 10:36 AM - +263 78 199 1982: I have never heard of it before
13/2/24, 10:56 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is alright, Let me tell you a bit about the same.  Recently, Edoofa hosted a conference called the Symposium of Leaders, Innovators, and Creators at Edoofa, also known as 'SLICE-CON.'
13/2/24, 10:56 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: The conference was attended by all the Edoofians of 2023 and a few senior Edoofians from previous batches. It focused on the art of creation, innovation, and, most importantly, the mindset required to make an impact in one's career.
13/2/24, 10:56 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: During this Industrial Visit and the conference - SLICE CON, Corporate leaders, such as the CEOs and Co-founders from renowned companies like Rage Coffee, Sirona Hygiene, Jolin New York, and more, shared their insights and experiences. These individuals are at the helm of multi-millionaire brands, leading large marketing teams. Their presence added immense value, providing students with the opportunity to engage in transformative conversations.
13/2/24, 10:56 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Let me share a glimpse of the conference with you and your family. I am certain that you too would be this excited to attend such events when he comes to India. <This message was edited>

13/2/24, 10:57 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Let me know once you are able to go through the messages about the SLICE CON, along with the images and videos shared with you. This was indeed a momentous step for all of our students, making them employable ready and giving them access to the right opportunities for their careers ahead.
13/2/24, 12:39 PM - +263 78 199 1982: Im done
13/2/24, 1:24 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that. Also, regarding the discussion we had the other day about the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan, I wanted to follow up on our last conversation. Have you, as a family, been able to discuss it? If so, I would like to understand how the discussion went. What were their thoughts about it? Did they have any specific queries or concerns that you would like us to address?
13/2/24, 1:28 PM - +263 78 199 1982: Yes we discussed about it and they were very happy about the Financial Secure Plan,we have no quiries at all we are just glad that there is something like that which makes education quite cheap
13/2/24, 1:40 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know, Parents and Violet. For the current round of students, there are only 27 seats available for the students who can benefit from the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan. 

Since you have been one of the most dedicated students, and I see you have great aspirations, I wanted you to be a part of the same set of students and start with your future planning the right way.
13/2/24, 1:40 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Also, as this plan commences from the month of February, for the efficient implementation of this plan, we need to decide on a fixed date on which you will deposit $150 every month. This will provide you with the flexibility to align your finances accordingly.
13/2/24, 1:40 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Our complete focus is on providing students and parents with the best ways to avail themselves of these opportunities. We understand that every parent may not be able to make the payment on our specified date. Therefore, considering this situation, we allow them to decide the payment date according to their comfort. In light of the same, may I know the fixed date every month on which you will deposit $150?
13/2/24, 2:41 PM - +263 78 199 1982: My dad will answer this when he is available

The experience was truly enriching for us, and we hope it was equally enjoyable for you as well.

Before we proceed with our discussion today, I would like to inquire how you are doing this fine morning?

26/2/24, 12:16 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. It has been a while since we last connected, and our team has had quite hectic past few days. As you already know, over the last weekend, Team Edoofa had been bustling with activity – both in India and Harare for the Meet and Greet '24. Now that things have settled down a bit, I wanted to express my sincere gratitude to you for participating in the event and playing a role in its success. I would like to share a few glimpses of the seminar with you, which demonstrates how enthusiastic and engaged our students were!
