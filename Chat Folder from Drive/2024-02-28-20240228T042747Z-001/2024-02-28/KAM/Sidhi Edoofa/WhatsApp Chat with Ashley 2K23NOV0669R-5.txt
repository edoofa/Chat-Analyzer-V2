29/12/23, 4:05 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon dear parents and Ashley

I hope this message finds you well and blessed. It has been a while since the last time we were connected with each other. As I was occupied with university obligations and Christmas preparations, I would like to take this opportunity to inquire how you are doing today?
29/12/23, 6:55 PM - +263 78 265 9728: We are fine Sir, how were your Christmas holidays?
29/12/23, 6:58 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: It was great, how was yours?
29/12/23, 7:00 PM - +263 78 265 9728: Not all that bad, Zim situation.
29/12/23, 7:16 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Here's a simpler breakdown:

Enrollment Fees: You paid $350, but this amount gets deducted from the overall fees you owe. So, it's like a discount.
Registration Fees: You'll pay between $500-$1000.
Deposit: $1500 to be paid in 10 months.
Additional Fees after Visa Payment: $900.
The total of all these payments adds up to $3,250. Now, the confusion arises because this exceeds the expected total fees for the year, given the 50-100% scholarship.

The scholarship's role is to reduce the amount you have to pay. Even if you've made some payments already, the scholarship could cover or reimburse part or all of these expenses:

Enrollment Fees: Already paid, but it's deducted from the total fees.
Registration Fees: The scholarship might cover part or all of this.
Deposit & Visa Payment Fees: These might also be included in what the scholarship covers.
So, although you've paid some fees upfront, the scholarship should eventually decrease the total amount you're supposed to pay. It might not be immediately visible in the payments you've made, but it should affect your final expenses after the scholarship adjustments are applied.

2/1/24, 6:33 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Eevning dear parent and my dear student!

I hope you had your wonderful holidays with your loved ones. As we embark on a furitful fresh new year. May I know if you are now reay to proceed with the session for the admisison process for today?
2/1/24, 7:33 PM - +263 77 749 1315: Evening, yes we are ready
2/1/24, 7:52 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: That's great. Now that you have all the information, I want you to take some time and discuss the financial security plan with your family members. Help them understand its importance and details. Once you're done, we can reconnect, have a discussion, and address any queries you may have. After resolving your concerns, I'll guide you through starting your financial security plan. 

While most students can discuss this with their parents the same day, I understand everyone is different. Could you let me know by when you think you'll have the discussion with your parents? This way, we can schedule our next session accordingly.
2/1/24, 8:32 PM - +263 77 749 1315: By tomorrow we will be done
2/1/24, 8:36 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: That's perfectly fine. In that case, we will conclude today's conversation, and I will connect with you on tomorrow to resume our discussion. In the meantime, I hope you'll have a detailed discussion with your family and jot down any questions or thoughts you have regarding the Financial Secure plan.

Wishing you a good day ahead, and please extend our regards to your family.

9/1/24, 9:42 PM - Dev Edoofa: Before we get into the specifics of your admission journey and talk about your admission process, I would like to share an exciting milestone that India as a country achieved within the first week of 2024 – the successful India's Chandrayaan-3 Engine Test. This accomplishment is responsible for the third lunar mission, aiming to land a rover on the Moon's south polar region and conduct scientific studies that could check Moon's viability to sustain life. It signifies a significant scientific advancement, laying the groundwork for future progress.

If I talk about myself, I have made a resolution to bring more humility in myself and bring about a change in my perspective to be a better version of myself all while ensuring that I help all of our students to achieve their educational goals. With that said, I would like to know what aspirations or a change in your approach towards life you wish to achieve?
26/1/24, 6:37 AM - +263 77 749 1315: Good morning Mr Dev, any updates please
26/1/24, 7:13 AM - +263 77 749 1315: By the way today is a public holiday in India. Happy Republic Day.

27/1/24, 10:25 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am positive that it will be. I was going through your application profile and it is my understanding that you were successfully introduced to Edoofa's Financial Secure Plan. May I know if I am correct?
27/1/24, 10:27 AM - +263 77 749 1315: Very correct Madam
27/1/24, 10:33 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for confirming that. May I know if you were able to go through the details and discuss the same together as a family?
27/1/24, 10:35 AM - +263 77 749 1315: Confirmed
27/1/24, 10:48 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that. Could you kindly share with me if you have any queries or thoughts regarding the same?

29/1/24, 3:35 PM - +263 77 749 1315: We are ready for the session please
29/1/24, 3:56 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to know that you are all doing well. I am doing fine too, thank you for asking. Before reaching out to you today, I was going through pictures and videos from Edoofa's very first SLICE CON held last week, and that sparked my curiosity about whether you are familiar with what SLICE CON is or not?
29/1/24, 3:59 PM - +263 77 749 1315: We are not familiar, may be if you can share with us what's it's all about
29/1/24, 4:25 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is alright, Let me tell you a bit about the same.  Recently, Edoofa hosted a conference called the Symposium of Leaders, Innovators, and Creators at Edoofa, also known as 'SLICE-CON.'
29/1/24, 4:25 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: The conference was attended by all the Edoofians of 2023 and a few senior Edoofians from previous batches. It focused on the art of creation, innovation, and, most importantly, the mindset required to make an impact in one's career.
29/1/24, 4:25 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: During this Industrial Visit and the conference - SLICE CON, Corporate leaders, such as the CEOs and Co-founders from renowned companies like Rage Coffee, Sirona Hygiene, Jolin New York, and more, shared their insights and experiences. These individuals are at the helm of multi-millionaire brands, leading large marketing teams. Their presence added immense value, providing students with the opportunity to engage in transformative conversations.
29/1/24, 4:25 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Let me share a glimpse of the conference with you and your family. I am certain that Ashley too would be this excited to attend such events when he comes to India.

29/1/24, 4:26 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Let me know once you are able to go through the messages about the SLICE CON, along with the images and videos shared with you. This was indeed a momentous step for all of our students, making them employable ready and giving them access to the right opportunities for their careers ahead.
29/1/24, 4:34 PM - +263 77 749 1315: Well that's great, hopefully you enjoyed that momentous occasion
29/1/24, 4:49 PM - +263 77 749 1315: Have just gone through the messages
29/1/24, 5:23 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Certainly. Also, regarding the discussion we had the other day about the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan, I wanted to follow up on our last conversation. Have you, as a family, been able to discuss it? If so, I would like to understand how the discussion went. What were their thoughts about it? Did they have any specific queries or concerns that you would like us to address?
29/1/24, 5:40 PM - +263 77 749 1315: We discussed it several times and have since mapped the way forward on how we can pay the instalments. The only queries raised were on the total amount of money to be paid before the commencement of the course which is around $3250 and seems to be above the total fees payment per year of between $2000- $3000 considering this is a scholarship with a quantum of between 50-100%
29/1/24, 5:41 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: After the 10th month of the payment plan, you will be required to deposit the money in your bank for the next 4 months, and post that you will have the option to save the amount in your own bank. Our goal is to ensure that in the first 10 months, we are able to save $1500 which will cover at least the 1st year of Ashley's education. I hope you are following?
29/1/24, 5:43 PM - +263 77 749 1315: We are together
29/1/24, 5:48 PM - +263 77 749 1315: This was the only query raised but seems Mr Shivjeet did justice to same
29/1/24, 5:49 PM - +263 77 749 1315: the same
29/1/24, 5:59 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Hence, I must clarify that the total amount you will be paying before the commencement of the course will be essentially $1500.
29/1/24, 5:59 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: As much as I would like to continue with our discussion, since my operational hours for the day have already concluded and I have had a long day, I would like to reconnect with you tomorrow at our scheduled time to further discuss the admission process. Until then, please take care and have a blessed day ahead!
29/1/24, 6:00 PM - +263 77 749 1315: My pleasure
30/1/24, 3:08 PM - +263 77 749 1315: Good afternoon, Ms Siddhi and the Edoofa family. Hope you are having a wonderful day today. Anywhere we are kindly informing you that we are ready for today's session

30/1/24, 4:00 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. I am well too, thank you for asking. May I know if you have any other queries related to the Financial Secure Plan before we proceed?
30/1/24, 4:02 PM - +263 77 749 1315: No queries
30/1/24, 4:48 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know, Parents and Ashley. For the current round of students, there are only 27 seats available for the students who can benefit from the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan. 

Since you have been one of the most dedicated students, and I see you have great aspirations, I wanted you to be a part of the same set of students and start with your future planning the right way.
30/1/24, 4:48 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Also, as this plan commences from the month of January, for the efficient implementation of this plan, we need to decide on a fixed date on which you will deposit $150 every month. This will provide you with the flexibility to align your finances accordingly.
30/1/24, 4:48 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Our complete focus is on providing students and parents with the best ways to avail themselves of these opportunities. We understand that every parent may not be able to make the payment on our specified date. Therefore, considering this situation, we allow them to decide the payment date according to their comfort. In light of the same, may I know the fixed date every month on which you will deposit $150?
30/1/24, 5:21 PM - +263 77 749 1315: I think we will be comfortable with the 30th of every month
30/1/24, 6:09 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing these details, your commitment to securing a seat in this exclusive program is appreciated.

Is it possible for one to pay an instalment in advance, for example if I pay for the month of February and March at once then pay for next instalment in April
1/2/24, 3:17 PM - +263 77 749 1315: Secondly, are we supposed to pay $150 plus the minimum 7% transaction charge or it's just the $150
1/2/24, 3:28 PM - +263 77 749 1315: Thirdly, in case of calamities such as death of the students before the commencement of the course are these funds refundable. Sorry for this one though we don't expect such circumstances but for interest sack.
1/2/24, 4:32 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your concerns with me sir. Allow me to help you with your questions one by one.

To begin with the advance payment, it is definitely possible for you to pay in advance and the same will be adjusted in your remaining fee. For example, if you pay $300 in the month of March, you can either choose to continue paying $150 from April and complete the payment plan early, or you can choose to make your next deposit in the month of May.
1/2/24, 4:33 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Second, you will be required to pay $150 + the minimum 7% transaction charges.
1/2/24, 4:38 PM - +263 77 749 1315: Duly noted
1/2/24, 4:43 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I will definitely help you out with your third and final question. Before that, I want to understand your perspective behind this question. This is the first time during my time here as a counsellor that someone has asked this question. If I may ask, what caused you to ask this question?
1/2/24, 4:51 PM - +263 77 749 1315: It happens in life, that's why I said for interest sack, there is nothing serious about this
2/2/24, 11:24 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Ashley.

I hope you are having a wonderful morning. I understand please. Thank you for letting me know that. However, something must have brought that thought into your mind, am I correct? I was wondering and I could not quite comprehend, hence I am just asking out of curiosity so that we can be on the same here. I hope you are understanding?
2/2/24, 11:58 AM - +263 77 749 1315: Good morning Ms Siddhi. That wasn't my thought but one of the family members asked me that question.
2/2/24, 12:01 PM - +263 77 749 1315: Hopefully it's now water under the bridge. Let's not dwell much on this
2/2/24, 12:03 PM - +263 77 749 1315: Am now even regretting as to why I asked this question
2/2/24, 1:17 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. I know you did not have any intentions to imply that this situation might happen. I only happened to be curious as to how your thought process worked.

To answer your query, in a situation where the student is not anymore alive to attend the university, I am afraid that according to the university the amount will be non-refundable. This is because once she pays her registration amount, the university blocks her seat and disables anyone else to occupy it. And in such a scenario, they will not be able to enroll someone else for that seat. I hope you understand how the policy works?
2/2/24, 1:20 PM - +263 77 749 1315: Duly noted. Thank you for the clarification
2/2/24, 1:23 PM - +263 77 749 1315: May you brief us on the Meet and Greet  Event to be held in Harare so that we prepare accordingly
2/2/24, 1:35 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to know that you are looking forward to the event, Mr. Machona. The event will be held towards the end of February and the team is currently in the process of finalizing the details. As soon as the preparations are complete, we will reach out to you with the details of the event.
2/2/24, 1:36 PM - +263 77 749 1315: Thank you very much
5/2/24, 3:06 PM - +263 77 749 1315: Afternoon Ms Siddhi and the Edoofa family. Hopefully you had a pleasant weekend. We are ready for today's session
5/2/24, 3:16 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Ashley.

I hope you all had a great weekend. How are you all doing today?
5/2/24, 3:23 PM - +263 77 749 1315: We are fine
5/2/24, 3:28 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Since we have successfully completed the agreement formalities, I will reconnect with you in a few days' time to discuss the various payment modes that can be availed by you to make the deposits in the upcoming months.
5/2/24, 3:32 PM - +263 77 749 1315: Noted, see you then
5/2/24, 3:33 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I wish you a blessed week ahead and kindly extend my regards to your family as well!
5/2/24, 3:36 PM - +263 77 749 1315: Definitely, will do that
7/2/24, 10:33 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Ashley

I hope you are all doing great. It has been a while since we last connected, and our team has had quite hectic past few days. As you already know, over the past three days, Team Edoofa has been bustling with activity – both in India and Harare for the Meet and Greet '24. Now that things have settled down a bit, I wanted to express my sincere gratitude to you for participating in the event and playing a role in its success. I would like to share a few glimpses of the seminar with you, which demonstrates how enthusiastic and engaged our students were!

Would you be willing to share your thoughts, including your interest in attending similar events in the future and any suggestions for improvement? Moreover, if you've captured any memorable moments in photos, we would greatly appreciate it if you could share them with us.
21/2/24, 3:21 PM - +263 77 749 1315: Good afternoon Ms Siddhi and the Edoofa team. Well it's been a while since we last connected. Anywhere I don't know how I can put this across. I am saddened to inform you that we could not make it to the event. Our efforts to communicate with the school authorities prior to the event date were in vain, so we had to travel to the school with the hope of taking Ashley to Harare but however when we arrived at the school we were told that Ashley had gone for the Athletics Gala the previous day. So were left without any option but to travel back home. Really I think we missed a lot.
21/2/24, 3:23 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand sir. I appreciate your consideration and efforts towards attending the event. It is unfortunate, however, I am hopeful that you will be able to meet with the team and attend the next time we have such an event in Zimbabwe.

With the document in our possession, we are now prepared to proceed with the next steps. As mentioned earlier, one crucial aspect we need to address is the payment method for your monthly deposits.

Furthermore, please note that the deadline for the payment will be *29 February 2024*. This will be the recurring date for your monthly deposits. May I know if you are currently available to discuss the payment methods?
