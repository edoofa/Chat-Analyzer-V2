I firmly believe that with the commencement of this new year, comes the promise of fresh beginnings, guiding the way for the actualization of one's deepest dreams and aspirations. As we stand on the threshold of this promising year, I am filled with excitement for the adventures it holds.
6/1/24, 1:10 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: In the same spirit, I would like to share that I am embarking on a journey as I prepare myself to pursue my doctorate and take a step forward in my academic pursuits. This transition marks a significant chapter in my life as I will be bidding farewell to the cherished moments at the Admissions Team in Edoofa.

Over the past year, having the privilege of supporting numerous students, including you, in your pursuit of higher education has been truly rewarding. Witnessing our students thrive and excel in their dream universities and colleges has brought immense satisfaction.
6/1/24, 1:10 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: The decision to transition to a new phase in my life presents an incredible opportunity for me to continue contributing to the lives of students, ensuring their academic journey and overall experience remain enriched and fulfilling.

As I embark on this new journey, I want to assure you that I have entrusted your application file to capable hands. From this point forward, your admission journey will be seamlessly guided by one of our accomplished admission officers, *Ms. Siddhi,* who will connect with you on Tuesday.  I hope you will make yourself available for further procedures and will give your best to your career.
6/1/24, 1:10 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I extend my heartfelt wishes for your continued success and a bright future filled with educational accomplishments. Wish you all the best, and God Bless.

Mr. Shiveet
Edoofa Admission Team.
6/1/24, 1:26 PM - +263 71 287 4448: Noted well received. My wife will be online
8/1/24, 2:12 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and John,

I am *Ms. Siddhi Singh, Admission Officer at Edoofa* and I am honoured to assume the responsibilities previously held by Mr. Shivjeet. I will be guiding you toward realising your dream education with Edoofa. I am confident that together, we can ensure a promising start to your educational journey, leading to the right employment opportunities and ultimately, success for you and your family.
8/1/24, 2:12 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: In the past few days, I had an in-depth discussion with Mr. Shivjeet and had the opportunity to review your scholarship application file in our records. Through this process, I gained valuable insights into your dreams and aspirations to advance your academic career. Upon reviewing your application file, I was both impressed and reassured to assist you in achieving these goals here in India, which will unlock doors to incredible opportunities in the future.
8/1/24, 2:12 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Before we get into the specifics of your admission journey and talk about your admission process, I would like to share an exciting milestone that India as a country achieved within the first week of 2024 – the successful *India's Chandrayaan-3 Engine Test.* This accomplishment is responsible for the third lunar mission, aiming to land a rover on the Moon's south polar region and conduct scientific studies that could check Moon's viability to sustain life. It signifies a significant scientific advancement, laying the groundwork for future progress.
8/1/24, 2:12 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This achievement has not only pushed boundaries but also has inspired young minds all over the world to pursue their dreams. On the same note, I wanted to extend my heartiest wishes for the New Year to you and your family and check in to see how you and your family started your year?
9/1/24, 5:28 AM - +263 77 625 6363: Good morning Ms Siddhi Singh
9/1/24, 5:28 AM - +263 77 625 6363: Here we are okay and started our new year in the best possible way. How about you, how are and how did you start your new year there
9/1/24, 5:28 AM - +263 77 625 6363: Wow this is brilliant
9/1/24, 8:46 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is so good to hear, John. The beginning of my New Year was quite happy as well, as I started it off with my family. Thank you for asking.

A new year brings forth a multitude of possibilities and fresh opportunities for growth and self-discovery. Though the new year itself may not bring immediate transformation, it marks a symbolic turning point, a chance to reflect and set new goals for ourselves. This year, I have decided to practise more compassion, learn at least one new skill, and assist students who were unable to proceed further with their admission process in 2023, guiding them to build their envisioned future.

May I ask what changes or additions you have decided to make in the year 2024?
9/1/24, 11:38 AM - +263 77 625 6363: I don't think there are any major changes
9/1/24, 12:10 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: It's perfectly fine if you don't have any resolutions for the New Year; sometimes, focusing on perfecting what you currently have can be equally impactful and meaningful.

Now, I would like to shift focus to your admission process. As per your application file, it seems that you were unable to proceed with your admission formalities scheduled for August 2024. Since a few months have passed, and this is our first interaction, I would like to inquire why you were unable to do so and if now is the right time for you to focus on your university admission journey for higher education abroad.
9/1/24, 12:20 PM - +263 77 625 6363: Last year there is a period I was writing my exams and that time I wasn't available
9/1/24, 12:23 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is completely understandable. Working hard and concentrating on examinations is very important, and it is good to hear that you were focused on it to perform your best during examinations.

May I know if now is a good time to proceed with your admission process to ensure that you secure a scholarship seat with the best university for your education?
9/1/24, 12:26 PM - +263 77 625 6363: Yes absolutely
9/1/24, 12:44 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is good to know, John. Before we move ahead with your application process, I believe we need you to share the following documents with us as they are required for your university application preparation:

*1. A-Level Result/Letter of Recommendation/Statement of Entry (A-Level).*

*2. O-Level Results*

*3. Identity proof (International Traveling Passport or National ID or Birth Certificate)* <This message was edited>

9/1/24, 7:22 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing all the documents with me, John.
9/1/24, 7:23 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: However, my operational hours have come to an end for the day. I will reschedule our conversation for 8:00 AM tomorrow, does that work with you?
9/1/24, 7:25 PM - +263 77 625 6363: Yes ma'am I'll be available
9/1/24, 7:26 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Alright, dear. I will reconnect with you tomorrow at 8:00 AM. Take care and have a blessed night!
10/1/24, 8:14 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good morning, dear. How are you today?
10/1/24, 8:16 AM - +263 77 625 6363: Good morning how are you
10/1/24, 8:18 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am well. Thank you for asking, dear. Are you ready to move forward with your application process?
10/1/24, 8:23 AM - +263 77 625 6363: Yes ma'am we can proceed
10/1/24, 8:36 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Very well, John. Shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
10/1/24, 8:36 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
10/1/24, 8:36 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
10/1/24, 8:36 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
10/1/24, 8:54 AM - +263 77 625 6363: Wonderful
10/1/24, 8:55 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Yes, indeed John. The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
10/1/24, 8:55 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.
10/1/24, 8:55 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
10/1/24, 8:58 AM - +263 77 625 6363: Thank you for your efforts
10/1/24, 9:00 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: You are welcome, dear. With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
10/1/24, 9:00 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
10/1/24, 9:01 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

6. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
10/1/24, 9:01 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.*
10/1/24, 9:09 AM - +263 77 625 6363: I've reviewed them
10/1/24, 9:09 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
10/1/24, 9:09 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of your A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive your letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you would be able to apply for the student visa.
10/1/24, 9:09 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same.
10/1/24, 9:09 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: This means you, as an Edoofa student, have the prestigious privilege of securing your seat before the competition even begins. *You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioning yourself as a frontier person in this endeavor.* <This message was edited>
10/1/24, 9:33 AM - +263 77 625 6363: Okay noted
10/1/24, 9:33 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
10/1/24, 9:33 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
10/1/24, 9:33 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
10/1/24, 9:34 AM - +263 77 625 6363: That's wonderful
10/1/24, 9:36 AM - +263 77 625 6363: Yes, I understand thank you
10/1/24, 9:42 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $100 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $1000, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $900.
10/1/24, 9:42 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $1000 fee, you will only be required to pay $900. Once this payment is completed, the entire $1000 amount will be adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $100 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $1000. Does this explanation resonate with you?
10/1/24, 9:54 AM - +263 77 625 6363: Yes I understand thank you
10/1/24, 9:55 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
10/1/24, 9:55 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $100 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
10/1/24, 9:55 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for January 25, 2024, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $900, you'll need to make a payment of $450 on or before January 25, 2024. The remaining $450 should be paid by February 25 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
10/1/24, 10:05 AM - +263 77 625 6363: No no for now it's okay, you can proceed
10/1/24, 10:10 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
10/1/24, 10:16 AM - +263 77 625 6363: I think it'll be assessed by my statement of entry, O level results, my responses to the Academic interview questions and my statement of purpose
10/1/24, 10:20 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Yes, that is indeed correct. Let me help you with a more detailed explanation of it. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
10/1/24, 10:20 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
10/1/24, 10:20 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
10/1/24, 10:20 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
10/1/24, 10:36 AM - +263 77 625 6363: Yes it is now very clear
10/1/24, 10:42 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad.
10/1/24, 10:42 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
10/1/24, 10:45 AM - +263 77 625 6363: I guess so
10/1/24, 10:48 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Yes, that is indeed correct, I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
10/1/24, 10:49 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

*1. Reappear in A Level*

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
10/1/24, 10:49 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
10/1/24, 11:31 AM - +263 77 625 6363: All clear
10/1/24, 12:08 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree*

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her/his interest in August 2024 itself.
10/1/24, 12:09 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
10/1/24, 12:15 PM - +263 77 625 6363: All clear I can see the benefits
10/1/24, 12:47 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career*

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
10/1/24, 4:28 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: May I know if you were able to go through my previous message, @263776256363 ?
10/1/24, 4:32 PM - +263 77 625 6363: Ohh okay noted
10/1/24, 4:34 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Very well, dear.
10/1/24, 4:35 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
10/1/24, 4:41 PM - +263 77 625 6363: No queries yet all clear
10/1/24, 4:41 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Alright dear, I am glad. With this, we come to a conclusion to our conversation today and we will move ahead with sending out your application to universities . Are you excited to initiate the process? Currently, 69 students have already secured their seats, leaving 31 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
10/1/24, 4:43 PM - +263 77 625 6363: Yes ma'am I'm so excited
10/1/24, 4:50 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. 

The universities would take three to five days of time to evaluate your application after which if they accept your application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.

With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.
10/1/24, 4:52 PM - +263 77 625 6363: Same to you have a blessed day
11/1/24, 8:44 AM - +263 77 625 6363: Good morning
11/1/24, 9:22 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good morning dear. How are you today?
11/1/24, 9:29 AM - +263 77 625 6363: I'm okay how are you
11/1/24, 9:34 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I'm doing good. Thank you for asking, dear. How may I help you today?
11/1/24, 9:35 AM - +263 77 625 6363: We can continue with the sessions
11/1/24, 11:57 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Dear, we have completed the step 3 of the admission cycle, and have initiated the step 4 of the admission cycle i.e., Offer Letter from the University/College. They will take 3-5 days to evaluate your application after which I will reach out to you again.
11/1/24, 11:57 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I hope that is clear?
11/1/24, 3:22 PM - +263 77 625 6363: All clear thank you
11/1/24, 3:23 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: You are welcome, John. Until then, have a blessed rest of the day and take care!
16/1/24, 7:08 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Evening, Parents and John,

I hope this message finds you in good health and high spirits. It is a pleasure to reconnect with you today, and I am excited to share an important update with you.

Since our last discussion, the admissions team has been working diligently to process your scholarship application for universities in India under the Endowment plan. I am pleased to inform you that your application has been accepted by one of the leading universities, Lovely Professional University in India, and they have decided to offer you a scholarship.
16/1/24, 7:08 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
16/1/24, 7:08 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: The university will be mailing you the official offer letter shortly. However, since we received it in advance, we wanted to share this wonderful news with you and provide a head start on our discussions.

17/1/24, 12:51 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and John,

In light of the offer letter you received, I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to you and your family on this remarkable achievement in your academic journey.

Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion for you and your family, and I can only imagine the excitement that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.
17/1/24, 12:51 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now that you have the letter in your possession, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you've had the chance to go through the offer letter thoroughly. 

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
17/1/24, 12:57 PM - +263 77 625 6363: Good afternoon
17/1/24, 12:57 PM - +263 77 625 6363: Yes I went through the offer letter
17/1/24, 1:00 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As we proceed with today's discussion, we will get into the details of this specific offer letter. I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.
17/1/24, 1:00 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
17/1/24, 1:14 PM - +263 77 625 6363: Okay what about my A level results
17/1/24, 1:15 PM - +263 77 625 6363: Do they have anything to do with the offer lettee
17/1/24, 1:29 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: In recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their A-Level results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey.
17/1/24, 1:30 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results?
17/1/24, 2:14 PM - +263 77 625 6363: <Media omitted>
17/1/24, 2:14 PM - +263 77 625 6363: I had 3 points 1 in each subject
17/1/24, 2:28 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your results with me, John. I noticed that your A-level results didn't turn out as we had hoped. If I may ask, were there any challenges that you were facing with your exam preparations?
17/1/24, 2:49 PM - +263 77 625 6363: Yes there were a couple of challenges
17/1/24, 2:50 PM - +263 77 625 6363: Since I didn't perform well I think it's okay for me to choose option 7
17/1/24, 2:53 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: If I may ask, could you share about the challenges you faced, dear?
17/1/24, 2:56 PM - +263 77 625 6363: Switching of teachers, going for while without a teacher, not finishing the syllabus
17/1/24, 3:14 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand, dear. Instability in guidance during exam preparations can be a challenge. However, you were able to secure a passing grade in all subjects even with the challenges you were facing, dear.
17/1/24, 3:15 PM - +263 77 625 6363: Yes I tried
17/1/24, 3:16 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad that you tried your level best under the difficult circumstances, and were able to perform to the best of your abilities, dear.
17/1/24, 3:17 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Under normal circumstances, a student would not be eligible to secure a scholarship seat. However, since you have the Endowment Program benefits, you are still eligible to go ahead with your admission process. The Endowment Program ensures that you do not lose out on your scholarship opportunity and are able to pursue your dream of getting higher education here in India.
17/1/24, 3:18 PM - +263 77 625 6363: Thank you
17/1/24, 3:20 PM - +263 77 625 6363: Okay is it possible for me to change program <This message was edited>
17/1/24, 3:22 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: May I know what program do you want to change it to and why you wish to do so?
17/1/24, 3:27 PM - +263 77 625 6363: I want to do Geology
17/1/24, 3:34 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: What caused this shift in your decision to pursue geology, dear?
17/1/24, 3:54 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am only asking so that I can understand your situation better and provide assistance to the best of my ability. In order to do that, I want  to understand what exactly caused you to take a decision of changing your course from Biochemistry to Geology, when both of these fields are quite different. Can you help me with it?
22/1/24, 3:02 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and John,

I hope this message finds you well. With regards to our discussion last week, I was expecting a response from your end to have further conversation about the offer letter you have received from the university and guide you through the admission next steps in your journey with Edoofa.

However, it appears that my messages might not have gotten through, and since it has been a few days, I wanted to reach out and check if we are still connected. Have you had the opportunity to review my previous messages?
22/1/24, 3:24 PM - +263 77 625 6363: Hello how are you
22/1/24, 3:24 PM - +263 77 625 6363: Yes, I was saying I want to change from biochemistry to geology
22/1/24, 4:01 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. That is definitely possible. May I ask what has caused your shift in the decision to pursue geology instead of biochemistry? Understanding your situation better will help me to provide you with the best possible solution.
22/1/24, 4:05 PM - +263 77 625 6363: It's because of my grades and also here it's very beneficial
22/1/24, 4:19 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand. May I also ask if you were engaged in other commitments in the past few days because of which you were unable to respond to my message on Wednesday?
22/1/24, 4:21 PM - +263 77 625 6363: It's because of no electricity
22/1/24, 4:31 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Alright please I understand. I kindly request that, if for any reason you are unable to connect with me, you inform me through your parents' phone. Time is of the essence now that you have received your offer letter, considering the approaching deadline. I trust you will be mindful of this going forward.
22/1/24, 4:32 PM - +263 77 625 6363: Okay noted
22/1/24, 4:33 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Coming back to your concern, I understand your point of concern. However, with your results, you are still eligible to pursue biochemistry. May I know if you have any particular interest in the field of geology due to which you wish to change the course?
22/1/24, 4:36 PM - +263 77 625 6363: For me geology here it's really beneficial and kinda on demand and also I find it interesting
22/1/24, 4:43 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know John. Understanding your situation better will help me provide you with an appropriate solution, hence may I know more about your perspective behind this decision? Since biochemistry is a subject that is accepted worldwide, because it is a part of medical sciences which is a requirement of every country across the globe. However, if you study geology, your areas of research and job will be limited to only a few places in the world. Could you please elaborate on your decision so that I can better understand your perspective?
22/1/24, 4:55 PM - +263 77 625 6363: I know it'll be limited to some extent but looking at the other side to some extent very beneficial interns of my home country and here this field is very beneficial since the main sources of income are mining and farming
22/1/24, 4:59 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I appreciate you explaining your perspective to me John. Students usually pursue higher education abroad because along with quality education, they are also looking for better career opportunities. May I ask if you are planning on going back to your home country and settling there after pursuing your higher education abroad?
22/1/24, 5:03 PM - +263 77 625 6363: Yes I too am pursuing higher and quality education it's all about better carrier opportunities be it in home country or not
22/1/24, 5:17 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Correct, John. If you don't mind, to assist you further, I would like to contribute to your perspective. Biochemistry is a degree that is widely accepted and provides job opportunities globally. Consider situations such as a pandemic outbreak, like COVID-19; during such crises, the medical industry experiences significant growth, and ongoing research is crucial to prevent and address similar situations. Pursuing a degree in biochemistry opens doors to various job opportunities in the medical sector worldwide. Additionally, the skills and knowledge gained in biochemistry contribute to advancements in healthcare and research, making it a valuable and impactful field of study.
22/1/24, 5:20 PM - +263 77 625 6363: I understand that part
22/1/24, 5:21 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: It's important to note that choosing Geology may somewhat limit the range of job opportunities available to you. Given the current economic challenges in Zimbabwe, planning to return after pursuing higher education abroad might pose challenges for your career growth. To illustrate, three months ago, $1 was equivalent to 5000 bonds, but as of today, the value has increased to more than 7000 bonds. Considering the instability and economic factor, would you not agree that pursuing a degree that lets you have a variety of career opportunities would be beneficial? <This message was edited>
22/1/24, 5:33 PM - +263 77 625 6363: Yes that's correct, but geology is limited because not every country has got mines but then those few countries with the mining sector there are opportunities and would be really beneficial once in it
22/1/24, 5:34 PM - +263 77 625 6363: Your points are really really good can you give some time to consult my parents
22/1/24, 5:41 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: You are right, John. The countries with mining sector do offer good opportunities, however it is also important to consider the economical situation of the country before taking a call. I only wanted to highlight both sides of the option to you, so that you are able to make an informed decision. As your admission officer, my recommendation is to continue with the course you have taken because it has great career opportunities. <This message was edited>
22/1/24, 5:42 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: However, I wanted to inform you that if you wish to pursue Geology instead of Biochemistry, that is definitely possible. You will be eligible to pursue the course in the same university i.e., Lovely Professional University. You may take today's time to discuss the same in detail with your family. I will reconnect with you tomorrow to take an update on your decision. Until then, please take care and have a blessed night!
22/1/24, 5:46 PM - +263 77 625 6363: Okay noted
22/1/24, 5:46 PM - +263 77 625 6363: Have blessed night
24/1/24, 9:44 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and  John. I hope you are having a lovely morning. How are you all doing today?
24/1/24, 9:46 AM - +263 77 625 6363: Good morning, we okay how are you
24/1/24, 9:51 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. I am doing fine John, thank you for asking.
24/1/24, 9:51 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: May I know if you had the opportunity to discuss your course details with your family?
24/1/24, 10:12 AM - +263 77 625 6363: Yes and it's still geology
24/1/24, 10:16 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Alright please I understand. Thank you for letting me know of the same. In such a case, we have initiated the course change request with the university. In the meanwhile, we can proceed with the letter discussion as the details of the letter and your fees will remain the same, only with the change in your course. I hope you are following?
24/1/24, 10:18 AM - +263 77 625 6363: Yes I'm following
24/1/24, 10:22 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: In such a case, let us proceed with your letter discussion. As we proceed with today's discussion, we will get into the details of this specific offer letter. I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.
24/1/24, 10:22 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
24/1/24, 10:23 AM - +263 77 625 6363: Okay noted
24/1/24, 10:23 AM - +263 77 625 6363: Yes it's okay you may proceed
24/1/24, 10:25 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Amazing. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from LPU University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
24/1/24, 10:25 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion -

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission Processing Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4. What’s the Registration fee?
24/1/24, 10:34 AM - +263 77 625 6363: 1.    $975

2.    3 years

3.   $200

4.    $700
24/1/24, 10:38 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Yes, that is correct. As you can see in your offer letter, your course is a 3-year-long course, and each year is divided into 2 semesters, this means that you will have 6 semesters in your degree.*

After the scholarship, your per semester tuition fee is $975 making your per annum tuition fee ($975*2) = $1950. Is that clear?
24/1/24, 10:39 AM - +263 77 625 6363: Yes noted
24/1/24, 10:40 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, Let me also brief you on the two categories of accommodation that are available at LPU -

*1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels inside LPU have different categories. Standard Room with Air Cooler and Standard Room with Air Conditioner with a different number of seaters, the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want.

The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a standard four-seater air cooler room is $1125 and the per annum standard mess/food service fee is $550 and this increases with the type of room/meal plan you choose.
24/1/24, 10:41 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

We also have many students in India who have opted for accommodation outside the LPU campus considering it is more affordable, the cost will be around $1000 per annum and that includes Rent, Food, Wifi Service, and other basic amenities such as water and electricity bills.

The outside accommodations are safe. Students have an option to cook for themselves, along with that they find a community of Edoofians from Africa who are already studying at the same university as them.
24/1/24, 10:41 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: If you decide to stay on campus, the university officials will help you settle and will be taking responsibility for your well-being, our per annum accommodation cost will be $1675.

However, if a student doesn’t wish to stay on campus and is looking for more affordable accommodation options, in that case, they can go with the off-campus accommodation where their per annum cost would be around $1000 including the food cost and they can also cook food for themselves.
24/1/24, 10:41 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: For the off-campus accommodation, you can connect with any of the Edoofians staying off-campus, and he/she would help you look for the off-campus accommodation options. If you are not connected with any students, we will help you connect with them near your time of arrival so that they can help you with the off-campus accommodation options.

LPU never forces anyone to choose the Hostel, they ask them to visit the campus, check for themselves, and then decide whether he/she wants to stay inside or outside the campus. Are you clear on this?
24/1/24, 10:44 AM - +263 77 625 6363: Very clear thank you
24/1/24, 10:44 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: You also have the examination fee of $75 which is due every semester, and the health insurance fee. A Medical Health Insurance policy is mandatory for all international students and they can get it from the university itself and it would cost them $50 per annum subject to yearly revision.

If God forbids and something happens to you during your higher education, you would be protected from the financial risks or uncertainties that arise due to a medical emergency. I hope you are clear about this?
24/1/24, 10:46 AM - +263 77 625 6363: Ohh, okay noted
24/1/24, 10:46 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $700 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on  January 30th, 2024*. I hope we are together so far?
24/1/24, 10:53 AM - +263 77 625 6363: Okay that's clear
24/1/24, 10:54 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $100 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
24/1/24, 10:56 AM - +263 77 625 6363: Yes please
24/1/24, 10:56 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $100 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $600 of the registration fee. This $600 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:
1. An initial payment of *$300 before the first deadline date of January 30th, 2024* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).
2. A subsequent payment of *$300 before the second deadline date of February 29th, 2024* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
24/1/24, 10:56 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $600 within 15 working days, before January 30th, 2024. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
24/1/24, 11:00 AM - +263 77 625 6363: Okay noted <This message was edited>
24/1/24, 11:02 AM - +263 77 625 6363: It's clear
24/1/24, 11:02 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Alright, please. Now, let us come to the payment mode for your university registration fee due -

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.

There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
24/1/24, 11:04 AM - +263 77 625 6363: Yes
24/1/24, 11:04 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Alright please, If you are planning to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
24/1/24, 11:04 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
24/1/24, 11:04 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
24/1/24, 11:23 AM - +263 77 625 6363: Okay thank you
24/1/24, 11:29 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: You are most welcome. Alternatively, I was also going through your application file and noticed that you made a deposit of your enrollment fee through Mr. Shorwis FBC Bank Account.

If you want to use the same mode of payment for your university registration fee, you can do that as well since it would be feasible and the International Transfer Charges are 12.5% of the amount you want to send. I will share the account details with you once again for your reference:
24/1/24, 11:29 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Bank Name: FBC
Branch: Mutare
Account Holder Name: Kawadza Shorwi
Account Number: 5333 0380 0918 0214
Contact Number: +263 77 364 0738
24/1/24, 11:32 AM - +263 77 625 6363: Okay
24/1/24, 11:32 AM - +263 77 625 6363: Thank you
24/1/24, 11:34 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now that you know your per annum educational expenses for your education abroad, let me also help you understand how you can make your education more affordable.

Ideally, the complete per annum fee is to be paid by the student, however, for students under the Edoofa Program, they have an additional opportunity of the EWYL Program. Because of that, you as a student can earn $800 to $1200 worth of scholarship credits in a year and use them to pay a part of your fee.
24/1/24, 11:34 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I would also like to inform you that the above range shared does not mean that a student can earn credits only up to $1200. There is no upper limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits.

In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his or her higher education, they can earn accordingly. Are you clear on this?
24/1/24, 11:36 AM - +263 77 625 6363: Yes very clear
24/1/24, 11:37 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, do you have any queries that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
24/1/24, 11:39 AM - +263 77 625 6363: No queries you really explained thank you
24/1/24, 11:43 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that. Let me also share a few insights into the university with you -
24/1/24, 11:43 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: LPU is one of the best universities in India and it has been ranked in the top 80 universities worldwide, because of its international tie-ups, the exposure a student gets at the university is indomitable. 

It has a campus of 800 acres, with over 100,000 students studying from all over the world. Students from LPU are placed at Microsoft, Google, IMF, Work Bank, and many more. It has spent a lot of money building the infrastructure so that a quality service can be given to the students.
24/1/24, 11:43 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: The students at LPU are not only looking for Academics but holistic development is given the utmost importance. The students there can join clubs to represent the University in various competitions like MUN, Debate, and Sports along with various other activities.

As you can not visit the campus and see it for yourself, in that case, you can take a virtual tour of the campus, it is open 24/7 and is never off. Here is the link for the same - https://www.lpu.in/virtual-tour/

24/1/24, 11:44 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, I would also encourage you to take some time and share your offer letter from LPU with your family, have a detailed discussion with them, and help them understand the letter better. 

I am sure they must be quite excited for you since you have been offered a scholarship by one of the top Indian universities and now you are one step closer to making your dream of education abroad a reality.
24/1/24, 11:44 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: During your conversation, if you come up with any queries or any concerns, I would encourage you to note them down so that we can have a detailed discussion on them by tomorrow at 01:00 PM and also discuss the way forward for your admission process.
24/1/24, 12:00 PM - +263 77 625 6363: Okay noted
24/1/24, 12:02 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: On this note, let us conclude our conversation for today. I hope you have a fruitful discussion with your family. Have a blessed day ahead!

I hope you are doing well and I find you in high spirits. After our previous discussion, I am sure you and your family were filled with anticipation regarding the opportunity presented by Lovely Professional University.
