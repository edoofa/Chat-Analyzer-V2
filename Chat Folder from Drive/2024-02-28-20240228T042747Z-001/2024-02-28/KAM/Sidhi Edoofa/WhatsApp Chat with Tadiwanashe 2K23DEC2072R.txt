12/2/24, 3:37 PM - +27 72 947 0473: Speaking directly you mean a video call or telephonically
12/2/24, 3:45 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: It will be done in the WhatsApp group and sometimes on video call when necessary. Your designated EWYL mentor will inform you whenever you are required to connect on a video call or telephonically. I hope this is clear?
12/2/24, 3:47 PM - +27 72 947 0473: Thank you..it's very clear maam
12/2/24, 3:58 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: You are most welcome. Thank you for letting me know. Moving forward in today's session, we will discuss a bit about your university admission journey. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts. I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them.

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
12/2/24, 4:03 PM - +27 72 947 0473: Thank you ..we are follo
12/2/24, 4:04 PM - +27 72 947 0473: We are following
12/2/24, 4:09 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
12/2/24, 4:18 PM - +27 72 947 0473: Goodday ..we went through it
12/2/24, 4:48 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
12/2/24, 4:48 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
12/2/24, 4:59 PM - +27 72 947 0473: Yes ma'am the steps are clear
12/2/24, 5:20 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps - 

*Step 3: Introduction to the Financial Secure Plan* - Parents with children embarking on their university journey within the next one to two years face important decision-making and rigorous financial planning. Edoofa recognizes the significance of this transition and hence has introduced the Edoofa Secure Plan - a unique and systematic strategy to empower parents in financial planning and preparing for their child's tertiary education well in advance.
12/2/24, 5:20 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Scholarship Offer Letter from the university would be issued next year in the month of August.

I hope you are following?
12/2/24, 11:10 PM - +27 72 947 0473: Yes we are following

We applaud you for your commitment and patience..Have a blessed weekend too.
26/2/24, 10:35 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Tadiwanashe,

I hope you had a wonderful weekend. Over the weekend, our team engaged in discussions regarding the Meet and Greet Seminar, reflecting on the valuable insights gained from interacting with our students. The experience was truly enriching for us, and we hope it was equally enjoyable for you as well.

Before we proceed with our discussion today, I would like to inquire how you are doing this fine morning?
26/2/24, 1:44 PM - +27 72 947 0473: We are doing fine ma'am..how are you that side
26/2/24, 1:51 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. I am doing good, thank you for asking. During our previous discussion, I was explaining the steps involved in the admission cycle. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. The registration fee will be paid through the savings you have accumulated visa the Financial Secure Plan. After the registration fee is paid, for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
26/2/24, 1:51 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
26/2/24, 1:54 PM - +27 72 947 0473: Very clear maam
26/2/24, 1:54 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through all 6 steps, if we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
26/2/24, 1:56 PM - +27 72 947 0473: Yes maam
26/2/24, 2:02 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
26/2/24, 2:02 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding. Until you are ready, shall we start with our discussion with me individually? 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
26/2/24, 2:35 PM - +27 72 947 0473: Yes ma'am
27/2/24, 12:28 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Tadiwanashe,

I hope you are doing well today. Kindly excuse me for not being able to respond to your last message as I was not feeling well and had to conclude my day early. However, I am pleased to let you know that I am feeling better today and eager to proceed with our discussion. Before we do so, I would like to ask how your day has been going so far?
27/2/24, 12:30 PM - +27 72 947 0473: Goodday ma'am.. we are pleased to know that you have recovered
