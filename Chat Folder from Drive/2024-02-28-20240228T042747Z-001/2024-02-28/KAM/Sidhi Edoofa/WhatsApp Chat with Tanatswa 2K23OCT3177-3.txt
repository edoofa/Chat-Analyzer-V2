19/12/23, 6:24 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, dear parents and Tanatswa!

I hope you are doing well today. Thank you for your patience. Please pardon me for not being able to connect with you recently. I was occupied with university officials and tasked with a campus visit.  You will be provided with the EWYL details very soon, the mentors are currently shorting out the allocations for now.
29/12/23, 4:06 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon dear parents and Tanatswa

I hope this message finds you well and blessed. It has been a while since the last time we were connected with each other. As I was occupied with university obligations and Christmas preparations, I would like to take this opportunity to inquire how you are doing today?
29/12/23, 6:12 PM - +263 77 368 2556: We are fine Sir, how are you
29/12/23, 6:19 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am great, thank you for asking. May I know if you are ready to proceed with the session?
29/12/23, 7:01 PM - +263 77 368 2556: Yes,  we can
29/12/23, 7:18 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, from the 16th Month till the 20th month, considering it is a 6-month window, you can again continue depositing the money ($150) with Edoofa which can be used in the fee as and when required or you can decide to save this $900 of these 6 months with you as well. This is something which you are free to choose. I hope you have understood the financial secure plan now?
29/12/23, 7:25 PM - +263 77 368 2556: Yes , i have understood
29/12/23, 8:05 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: That's great. Now that you have all the information, I want you to take some time and discuss the financial security plan with your family members. Help them understand its importance and details. Once you're done, we can reconnect, have a discussion, and address any queries you may have. After resolving your concerns, I'll guide you through starting your financial security plan. 

While most students can discuss this with their parents the same day, I understand everyone is different. Could you let me know by when you think you'll have the discussion with your parents? This way, we can schedule our next session accordingly.
29/12/23, 8:07 PM - +263 77 368 2556: Okay Sir, I will let you know once we have discussed the issue with my family
29/12/23, 8:27 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: That's perfectly fine. In that case, we will conclude today's conversation, and I will connect with you on the 2nd of January to resume our discussion. In the meantime, I hope you'll have a detailed discussion with your family and jot down any questions or thoughts you have regarding the Financial Secure plan.

Wishing you a good day ahead, and please extend our regards to your family.

29/1/24, 2:51 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is alright, Let me tell you a bit about the same.  Recently, Edoofa hosted a conference called the Symposium of Leaders, Innovators, and Creators at Edoofa, also known as 'SLICE-CON.'

29/1/24, 2:57 PM - +263 77 368 2556: I have gone through the messages , it was indeed a momentous step for the students
29/1/24, 3:22 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Certainly. Also, regarding the discussion we had the other day about the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan, I wanted to follow up on our last conversation. Have you, as a family, been able to discuss it? If so, I would like to understand how the discussion went. What were their thoughts about it? Did they have any specific queries or concerns that you would like us to address?
29/1/24, 3:51 PM - +263 77 368 2556: Yes , we discussed it , but we did not come to any agreement
29/1/24, 4:24 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That's alright. I understand that sometimes it takes some time to come to a conclusion before making an important decision. May I know if you have queries regarding the same that you might need my help with?
30/1/24, 2:31 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Tanatswa. I hope everything is well on your end. I was hoping to get a response form your end yesterday, but it seems like due to some reason we were unable to move ahead with our discussion. Before we proceed with our discussion today, I would like to check in on you and your family. How are you all doing today?
30/1/24, 2:34 PM - +263 77 368 2556: We are fine sir , how are you
30/1/24, 2:49 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. I am well too, thank you for asking. In our previous conversation, we were discussing about the Financial Secure Plan. You mentioned that you had the opportunity to discuss the same with your family, however you were not able to come to an agreement. May I know if you have any queries about the plan that you wish to share with me?
30/1/24, 2:56 PM - +263 77 368 2556: The only querry was that we may have problems with depositing  the $150 into the Edoofa account every month, won't we have problems if we fail to do so after paying for some months
30/1/24, 3:28 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. May I know what are your concerns related to depositing the amount to Edoofa every month?
30/1/24, 3:33 PM - +263 77 368 2556: What if fail to raise the money won't it affect the whole plan
30/1/24, 3:35 PM - +263 77 368 2556: Lets say I pay for three months then face a problem which may need money and I fail to deposit the money what happens to the plan
30/1/24, 4:08 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. Thank you for sharing your concern with me. With Edoofa's Financial Secure Plan, you are planning one step ahead and preparing for your future finances in advance. However, I understand that sometimes unforeseen situations may cause challenges in paying the deposit on the agreed date. In such a case, I believe that you are going to discuss the same with me, and will let me know the amount that you will be able to deposit in that particular month. In such a case, we will discuss how that amount can be clubbed and adjusted with a deposit in the next few months. If you fail to deposit any amount of money, there is going to be a penalty imposed on that month, which varies for every month. With Edoofa's Financial Secure Plan, you get the flexibility of deciding the deposit date, also while availing the benefit of the $150 waiver and saving $15 every month by not depositing the same amount in your bank. I hope we are together in this?
30/1/24, 4:18 PM - +263 77 368 2556: Yes I understand
30/1/24, 5:06 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad that was helpful for you. May I know if you have any other queries that you wish to share with me?
30/1/24, 5:36 PM - +263 77 368 2556: No sir , I would like to know when we will start with the plan since we are already in the final year of Tanatswa, s high school
30/1/24, 6:17 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: We will begin the plan from the month of February itself. I would love to continue with our discussion, however, my operational hours for the day have concluded. Let us reconnect tomorrow at our scheduled time to further discuss the Financial Secure Plan. I wish you a blessed day ahead!
30/1/24, 6:17 PM - +263 77 368 2556: Thank you Sir.
31/1/24, 2:04 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Tanatswa. I hope you are having a wonderful day! How are you all doing today?

31/1/24, 4:33 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Also, as this plan commences from the month of February, for the efficient implementation of this plan, we need to decide on a fixed date on which you will deposit $150 every month. This will provide you with the flexibility to align your finances accordingly.
31/1/24, 4:33 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Our complete focus is on providing students and parents with the best ways to avail themselves of these opportunities. We understand that every parent may not be able to make the payment on our specified date. Therefore, considering this situation, we allow them to decide the payment date according to their comfort. In light of the same, may I know the fixed date every month on which you will deposit $150?
31/1/24, 4:55 PM - +263 77 368 2556: We will discuss and get back to you sir.The father is not around
