I the mother will be taking my sick mother for check up.And the father will be at a church conference which is starting today.I thought some of the reasons will be private and confidential, the reason why I didn't share them here,I thought you would just trust us and take the excuse as genuine
16/2/24, 12:12 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand, ma'am. I never doubted the genuineness of your reasons for being unavailable; I simply sought clarity on why you wouldn't be able to attend the event, since  attending the event will give you the opportunity to clarify any queries that you might have and get a better understanding of the educational journey that lies ahead of you; and I would not want you to miss it for your own benefit. If you had expressed a desire to keep your reasons private, I would have respected that completely. I apologize if my inquiry made you feel uncomfortable.
16/2/24, 12:43 PM - +263 77 336 0264: No need for an appology Ms Siddhi,I haven't been offended at all.
