As we look ahead to the new year, I want to wish you all a very happy and healthy 2024. May this year bring you joy, success, and fulfillment in all that you do. May you continue to learn and grow, and may you never lose your passion for knowledge and discovery. <This message was edited>

30/12/23, 6:53 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Wishing you all a Happy New Year. May it be filled with love, laughter, and endless possibilities.
26/1/24, 9:20 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Chiedza,

I am *Ms. Siddhi Singh, Admission Officer at Edoofa*. Recently I was having a discussion with the Academic Board. They highlighted  that you have not been able to proceed with your admission process in a timely manner, since your child is at school and you have been occupied with work. Hence, I pitched in that I will be able to help you out and take over your application profile so that together we can ensure a timely and smooth progress. Since my operational hours accommodate your timings more suitably, I will be assuming the duties of your admission officer. I am optimistic that together, we can pave the way for an auspicious beginning to your academic journey, resulting in the right career prospects and eventual success for both you and your family.
26/1/24, 9:20 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
26/1/24, 9:20 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Today, on India's 75th Republic Day, I want to extend warm regards to you and your family! As we mark 75 years of freedom and democracy, my heart overflows with pride for our vibrant nation. Today, we celebrate the sacrifices of our forefathers, the strength of our unity, and the promise of a brighter tomorrow. Let's hold onto the spirit of this auspicious day, embracing the values that make India truly special.
26/1/24, 9:20 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: On this auspicious note, I would like to extend my heartiest regards to you and your family, and I hope that just like my proud nation, we will work unitedly and make progress in your admission process to ensure that you are able to realise your dream of pursuing higher education here in India. I would like to schedule our session for 1:30 PM tomorrow, so that we can discuss the progress and the next steps to be taken for your admission journey.
26/1/24, 10:13 PM - +263 77 277 0177: Noted.  Chibuwe high school has recently introduced a no cellphone policy and hence my kid is blocked from the whole Internet access. Liase with the school head to give Edoofa students access to Internet
27/1/24, 1:29 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Chiedza. Thank you for letting me know about Chiedza's situation. I hope you are having a lovely day. How are you all doing today?
27/1/24, 2:31 PM - +263 77 277 0177: We are all fine...she is now reachable
27/1/24, 2:34 PM - +263 78 779 0133: Yes I am
27/1/24, 3:42 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to know that you are all fine. Since this is the first time we are interacting, allow me to introduce myself. I am Miss Siddhi Singh, your Admission Officer. I belong from the vibrant city of Varanasi, known as one of the oldest living cities globally, Beyond my passion for education, I find joy in music and playing basketball. It is my pleasure to assist and guide you through the admission process, ensuring you achieve your dream education in India with the support of Edoofa.
27/1/24, 5:41 PM - +263 78 779 0133: Okay...thank you
27/1/24, 5:41 PM - +263 78 779 0133: My apologies..our network is low
27/1/24, 5:49 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand that you have school during the weekdays and your parents are occupied with work. In such a case, I want to ensure that our sessions are held in a timely and smooth manner so we can comfortably proceed with your application process. Could you kindly suggest a 1-hour slot between 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM when we can have our sessions?
27/1/24, 5:51 PM - +263 78 779 0133: During these weekdays??
27/1/24, 5:52 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Yes, that is correct. During the weekdays and Saturday.
27/1/24, 5:53 PM - +263 78 779 0133: I guess from 4pm to 5pm....tts when I will be done with school
29/1/24, 4:12 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Chiedza. I hope you are all doing well today. How has your day been going so far?
29/1/24, 4:22 PM - +263 77 277 0177: We are all fine. Joyce will join in soon. She is finishing a lesson at school
29/1/24, 4:29 PM - +263 78 779 0133: I am done n ready....Good Afternoon
29/1/24, 5:09 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you are all doing fine. I was going through Chiedza's application profile and it is my understanding that you have successfully completed the 2nd step of the admission cycle i.e., Statement of Purpose. May I know if I am correct?
29/1/24, 5:37 PM - +263 78 779 0133: Yes I have
29/1/24, 5:50 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for confirming that. As much as I would like to continue with our discussion, since my operational hours for the day have already concluded, I would like to reconnect with you tomorrow at our scheduled time to further discuss the Financial Secure Plan and admission process. Until then, please take care and have a blessed day ahead!
29/1/24, 5:51 PM - +263 78 779 0133: Oolk...thank you
30/1/24, 4:14 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Chiedza.

I hope everything is well on your end. Before we proceed with our discussion, I would like to check in on you and your family. How are you all doing today?
30/1/24, 4:38 PM - +263 78 779 0133: Afternoon...we are all doing well thank you
30/1/24, 5:30 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you are all well. I am doing fine too, thank you for asking. Let us move forward with our discussion. To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is BA LLB and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2025. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
30/1/24, 5:34 PM - +263 77 277 0177: On her behalf, l confirm that info is correct
30/1/24, 5:35 PM - +263 77 277 0177: Joice joining in soon
30/1/24, 6:17 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I would love to continue with our discussion, however, my operational hours for the day have concluded. Let us reconnect tomorrow at our scheduled time to further discuss the Financial Secure Plan. I wish you a blessed day ahead!
31/1/24, 4:21 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Chiedza. I hope you are having a wonderful day. How are you all doing today?
31/1/24, 4:27 PM - +263 78 779 0133: Yes good afternoon....we are doing well
31/1/24, 4:32 PM - +263 77 277 0177: We are all fine. Hope you are well that side.  Joice joining in soon. Thank you.
31/1/24, 4:32 PM - +263 78 779 0133: Am now in
31/1/24, 5:12 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that you are all doing well. I am doing great, thanks for asking. In our previous conversation, you had confirmed your chosen course and your year of intake. Thank you for your confirmation. Based on our experience of over 14 years and having assisted over 5000 students from different countries, we have realized that financial planning is the most important factor when a student plans for their higher education abroad.
31/1/24, 5:12 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am sure that you must be aware that 20-30% of students who are admitted into universities abroad are unable to fulfill their dream and come to India due to a lack of financial planning. The funds needed for booking flights, accommodation, and covering living expenses after arrival often become overwhelming, leading to the decision to defer their admission for a year. This, in turn, creates a gap in the child's education.
31/1/24, 5:12 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: To assist both students and parents in this regard, Edoofa Management has designed a Financial Secure Plan that aims to help you prepare for your higher educational finances without experiencing stress or last-minute rushes. I believe you must be wondering about the details of the same plan and how it helps the parents?
31/1/24, 5:33 PM - +263 78 779 0133: Yes
31/1/24, 6:48 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Edoofa Secure Plan is important for parents who have children joining the university for tertiary education in the next one to two years for several reasons:
31/1/24, 6:48 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 1. *Financial Preparedness:* The Edoofa Secure plan helps parents prepare financially for the costs after the Scholarship being offered so that they are not caught off guard.

2. *Reduced Financial Stress:* Having the Edoofa Secure Plan in place can significantly reduce the financial stress on you as parents when your child is about to enter university. Knowing that there is a dedicated fund for education expenses provides peace of mind.
31/1/24, 6:48 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 3. *Avoiding Debt*: Without proper savings, some parents may resort to taking out loans or accumulating credit card debt to cover their child's education costs. This Educational savings plan helps avoid the burden of debt and high-interest payments.

4. *Compound Interest:* By starting to save early and consistently contributing to the savings plan, parents can take advantage of compound interest, which can significantly increase the amount available for education expenses.
31/1/24, 6:48 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 5. *Flexibility and Control:* The Edoofa Secure savings plans allow parents to have greater control over their finances and how they allocate funds for their child's education. They can choose investment options that align with their risk tolerance and financial goals.

6. *Encouraging Responsibility*: Involving your child in the process of saving for their education teaches them financial responsibility and the value of higher education. It also motivates them to outperform in Academics.
31/1/24, 6:48 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 7. *Adapting to Unexpected Changes*: Life is full of surprises, and circumstances can change especially when there are political reforms changing each day impacting the Local Currency. Having an Edoofa Secure Plan allows parents to adapt to unexpected changes in their financial situation while still prioritizing their child's education.

8. *Peace of Mind:* Overall, having the Edoofa Secure plan provides parents with peace of mind, knowing that they are actively planning for their child's future and increasing the likelihood of providing them with a solid education.
31/1/24, 6:48 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, when you go through all the above benefits, I am sure you can see that the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan is an important financial tool for parents/students who are supposed to enter the university soon. 

It helps ensure that the financial aspect of tertiary education is well-managed, reduces stress, and allows parents to provide the best opportunities for their children without resorting to debt or financial hardship. Isn't this something you and your family also wish to have?
31/1/24, 6:52 PM - +263 78 779 0133: Yes it is..
31/1/24, 7:17 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Allow me to help you understand how the plan works. As you are aware, we are currently in January 2024, and we have a good 20 months to plan for your finances before you start your university education in 2025.
31/1/24, 7:17 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: During the counseling session, you were informed that at Edoofa, we guarantee a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship on the tuition fees. Hence, the cost of education, including food and accommodation after the scholarship, would be between $2000-$3000, and it could be even less. Not more than that.
31/1/24, 7:17 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This means that if you can save $150 per month for the next 20 months, you will be able to save $3000. This amount is more than enough for the first year of university fees, including tuition fees (if any), food, and accommodation. I hope you agree with this?
31/1/24, 9:44 PM - +263 78 779 0133: Yes I do
1/2/24, 10:39 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Chiedza. I hope you are all doing wonderful today!

Kindly excuse me for being unable to respond to your message last night, as our operational hours had already concluded. I am glad that you agree with it. Right, this means that by the time you would be in India, you would have already saved the $3000 that will cover the first-year fee.
1/2/24, 10:39 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, in these next 20 months, I am sure you would also be engaged in the EWYL program, and if you secure a minimum of $1000 in 20 months, that means the fees for 1.5 years are already secured.
1/2/24, 10:39 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, for a 3-year course, if we follow the same approach for the remaining 1.5 years, the educational journey for the student and the financial journey for the parent will be easy and smooth. I believe you must be able to see this perspective?
1/2/24, 12:21 PM - +263 78 779 0133: Yes I do
1/2/24, 2:13 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. With that said, there is also another benefit, I am sure being in Zimbabwe you know how drastically the exchange rate fluctuates.
1/2/24, 2:13 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: If you are buying a dollar today, you might be spending 7000 bonds, but if you buy a dollar after a month, the rate would be different.
1/2/24, 2:13 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Also, even if you choose to buy dollars every month and save at your home, it is not safe since there is news of robbery, and mugging every day.
1/2/24, 2:13 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: In that case, you will opt to save in the Bank, but again we know that savings in the Bank require a Nostro Account which means you have to pay the bank to keep your money safe, right?
1/2/24, 4:32 PM - +263 78 779 0133: Yeah
1/2/24, 4:56 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is great to hear, considering these constraints, Edoofa Management has decided to help the parents and students prepare for the journey way ahead of time by helping them save money with Edoofa without any additional charges but rather saving additional money as well. Do you want me to explain how this has been achieved?
1/2/24, 4:57 PM - +263 78 779 0133: Yes ...please do
2/2/24, 4:52 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Chiedza.

I hope you are having a wonderful day. Kindly excuse me for not being able to respond to your message last night as our team is currently working tirelessly towards the preparation of our upcoming Zimbabwe trip in the month of February. Before we proceed with our discussion, I would like to ask how are you doing today?
2/2/24, 5:00 PM - +263 77 277 0177: This is brilliant idea.  Can we have the banking details so that we start doing that and keeping our POP.
2/2/24, 5:26 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Definitely we can! I am pleased to know that you have a long-term vision for Chiedza's higher education journey. Allow me to provide you with further details about the plan before we proceed with the formalities of payment and agreement signing. <This message was edited>
2/2/24, 5:27 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Considering these constraints, Edoofa Management has decided to help the parents and students prepare for the journey way ahead of time by helping them save money with Edoofa without any additional charges but rather saving additional money as well. Do you want me to explain how this has been achieved?
2/2/24, 5:45 PM - +263 77 277 0177: It's fine go ahead. Thank you
2/2/24, 8:21 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that we are together so far. Since my operational hours have concluded and I have had a long day already, let us conclude our conversation for today. We will reconnect tomorrow to further discuss the Financial Secure Plan and the way forward.

I wish you a blessed night!
2/2/24, 8:30 PM - +263 77 277 0177: Thank you, good night
3/2/24, 11:43 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Chiedza. How are you all doing this fine morning?
3/2/24, 11:45 AM - +263 77 277 0177: We are fine and you. Joice may be facing network challenges on her side. I will stand for her until she joins in. Thank you for getting in touch.
3/2/24, 12:01 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that you are all fine. I am doing well, thank you for asking.

I understand please, thank you for letting me know that. Allow me to continue our previous conversation, and explain how the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan is helpful in overcoming the constraints faced by students and parents.
3/2/24, 12:01 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Program Fee (Enrollment Fee) that you were asked to pay is $350. Under the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan, a parent has to deposit a small amount of money which is $150 every month for the next 10 months. 

That means, in 10 months, the money saved will be $1500. When this money is saved, Edoofa will waive off $150 from the Edoofa Program/Enrollment Fee of $350, thereby making a straight saving of $150 in 10 months.
3/2/24, 12:01 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Imagine you paying $15 every month to the Bank of Zimbabwe to keep your money safe, and here Edoofa is paying you $15 every month to keep your money safe. Now, you must be wondering, why only for 10 months and not for 20 months, right?
3/2/24, 12:04 PM - +263 77 277 0177: It's fine. Understood.
3/2/24, 12:05 PM - +263 77 277 0177: Bank charges considered and it becomes too much
3/2/24, 12:20 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Indeed. Considering these constraints, Edoofa Management has decided to help the parents and students prepare for the journey way ahead of time by helping them save money with Edoofa without any additional charges but rather saving additional money as well. Do you want me to explain how this has been achieved?
3/2/24, 12:20 PM - +263 77 277 0177: Sure, go ahead.
3/2/24, 12:54 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Program Fee (Enrollment Fee) that you were asked to pay is $350. Under the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan, a parent has to deposit a small amount of money which is $150 every month for the next 10 months. That means, in 10 months, the money saved will be $1500.
3/2/24, 12:54 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That means, in 10 months, the money saved will be $1500. When this money is saved, Edoofa will waive off $150 from the Edoofa Program/Enrollment Fee of $350, thereby making a straight saving of $150 in 10 months.
3/2/24, 12:54 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Imagine you paying $15 every month to the Bank of Zimbabwe to keep your money safe, and here Edoofa is paying you $15 every month to keep your money safe. Now, you must be wondering, why only for 10 months and not for 20 months, right?
4/2/24, 7:17 AM - +263 77 277 0177: Noted
5/2/24, 4:25 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Chiedza.

I hope you all had a great weekend. How is everything on your end today?
6/2/24, 6:41 AM - +263 77 277 0177: Good morning.  Sorry l could not attend l was travelling to Harare from Masvingo yesterday.
6/2/24, 2:27 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Chiedza.

I hope you are all doing great today. I understand please, thank you for letting me know that. Before we proceed with our discussion today, I would like to ask how your day has been going so far?
8/2/24, 4:19 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Milan,

I trust this message finds you well. I had hoped to hear back from you in the past few days but it seems we were unable to connect. I understand that things can get busy, so I wanted to reach out today to ensure everything is alright on your end. If there's anything you need assistance with or any questions you have, please don't hesitate to let me know.
8/2/24, 4:35 PM - +263 77 277 0177: It was fine...thank you
8/2/24, 5:10 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. I was looking forward to our session yesterday, but I couldn’t reach you. Could you please explain what caused your unavailability?
8/2/24, 5:22 PM - +263 77 277 0177: Sorry work pressure.  Joice has no network.  But today l am available same time. Thank you
8/2/24, 5:29 PM - +263 78 779 0133: Hello everyone....sorry for not being available....have been busy with school work....for today I am online
8/2/24, 6:01 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. However, my operational hours for the day have already concluded. Hence, let us reconnect tomorrow at 4:00 PM for our session. I hope that you will be available to participate in our session tomorrow.

Have a blessed night ahead!
8/2/24, 6:05 PM - +263 78 779 0133: Hope so too...thank you
9/2/24, 4:26 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Chiedza.

I hope you are doing well. How has your day been going so far?
11/2/24, 1:24 PM - +263 78 779 0133: Has been flowing well....hope this message finds you well
12/2/24, 8:23 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Chiedza.

I hope you had a wonderful weekend. Before we proceed with our session, I would like to inquire, how is everything on your end today?
12/2/24, 8:27 AM - +263 77 277 0177: We are fine. Joice is at school but may join in soon
12/2/24, 8:54 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. In such a case, you as a parent can participate in our discussion as well and when Joice is back from school, she can go through our conversation and share any concerns that she might have here on the group itself. In such a case, if you are available, shall we proceed with our discussion?
12/2/24, 9:04 AM - +263 77 277 0177: Sure, let's proceed
12/2/24, 9:31 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Right. During our previous session, we were discussing about how the Financial Secure Plan works. Allow me to proceed with our discussion -
12/2/24, 9:31 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: If you see the bigger picture, you will realize that the reason is quite simple. Upon the completion of the 10 installments, the Edoofa Admissions team will initiate the Child’s Admission Process by applying early to the universities to secure their scholarship and their university seat.
12/2/24, 9:31 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Reserving seats earlier increases the chances of obtaining a maximum scholarship. A higher scholarship means lower fees, and by securing the seat, you will be entitled to pay the fees as per the old fee structure of the university, not the new one implemented in January 2025. Furthermore, when applying to the universities, you will receive an offer letter or a letter of intent detailing the fees, scholarship, and registration fees.
12/2/24, 9:31 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: As explained during the enrollment process, the registration fee is a portion of your first-year university fee, paid to reserve the seat. It ranges from $500-$1000 and is not an additional fee. 

From the $1500 you saved with Edoofa, the registration fee will be paid to the university, securing the seat. For instance, if the registration fee is $1000, Edoofa will pay $1000 from the $1500 saved in 10 months. The updated balance with Edoofa will be $500, which will be paid to the university upon your arrival in India.
12/2/24, 9:31 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: This eases the financial burden on the parent, as there is no immediate payment required upon the student's arrival. The $500 saved will cover the remaining fees for the semester/year, as specified in the offer letter from the university. What are your thoughts on this?
12/2/24, 9:33 AM - +263 77 277 0177: Sure you are right and maybe to kick start the game we can have the account details
12/2/24, 9:35 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to see that you wish to move forward with the plan, however, allow me to explain further details about the Financial Secure Plan with you so that you are able to have a complete understanding of how it works. If we are together here, shall I proceed?
12/2/24, 9:43 AM - +263 77 277 0177: Thank you. Proceed boss
12/2/24, 9:49 AM - +263 77 277 0177: Instalments will not suffocate us.
12/2/24, 9:55 AM - +263 77 277 0177: Noted. Thank you
12/2/24, 10:04 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to see that we are together so far. With this plan for the next 10 months, I am sure you must be wondering what will happen in the next 10 months, considering you have already secured your scholarship seat with the university due to your hard work in the first 10 months. Is my understanding correct?
12/2/24, 10:06 AM - +263 77 277 0177: Yaa sure correct
12/2/24, 10:06 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Let me help you with that as well. In the 11th month, you will be guided to open an FBC Mastercard bank account in Zimbabwe with a deposit of $150. The reason for this is that when you apply for your student Visa, the Embassy asks for a Bank Statement, and this account will serve that purpose.
12/2/24, 10:06 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: We understand it might be expensive if you deposit another $1500 for the remaining 10 months in FB  Bank Zimbabwe, so to avoid the same challenges, we have designed the plan accordingly. You will only be depositing for the 11th, 12th, 13th, and 14th month, which is 4 months.
12/2/24, 10:06 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Once the 4 months are completed, our Department of Student Welfare (DSW) team will assist you with your visa process. The bank statement will act as one of the required documents, and once you receive the visa, you can withdraw the amount from FBC and book the flight ticket. This will help you utilize the money as well. How does it sound?
12/2/24, 10:08 AM - +263 77 277 0177: Umm sounds good because it will be another big saving.
12/2/24, 10:09 AM - +263 77 277 0177: So is it Joice or the parent who is going to have the FBC account in the 11th month?
12/2/24, 10:10 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: It is advisable to open the account under the Joice's name, as it will help with her VISA process in the future.

Now, from the 16th Month till the 20th month, considering it is a 6-month window, you can again continue depositing the money ($150) with Edoofa which can be used in the fee as and when required or you can decide to save this $900 of these 6 months with you as well. This is something which you are free to choose. I hope you have understood the financial secure plan now?
12/2/24, 10:11 AM - +263 77 277 0177: Understand boss
12/2/24, 10:11 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: That's great. Now that you have all the information, I want you to take some time and discuss the financial security plan with your family members. Help them understand its importance and details. Once you're done, we can reconnect, have a discussion, and address any queries you may have. After resolving your concerns, I'll guide you through starting your financial security plan. 

While most people can discuss this with their family the same day, I understand everyone is different. Could you let me know when you think you'll have the discussion with your family? This way, we can schedule our next session accordingly.
12/2/24, 10:16 AM - +263 77 277 0177: It's fine and important.  Give me up to Wednesday afternoon to discuss with my family then we give you feedback
12/2/24, 10:17 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: That's perfectly fine. In that case, we will conclude today's conversation, and I will connect with you on Wednesday to resume our discussion. In the meantime, I hope you'll have a detailed discussion with your family and jot down any questions or thoughts you have regarding the Financial Secure plan.

Wishing you a good day ahead, and please extend our regards to your family.
12/2/24, 10:18 AM - +263 77 277 0177: Thank you and same to you👏👏

I hope you had a wonderful weekend. Over the weekend, our team engaged in discussions regarding the Meet and Greet Seminar, reflecting on the valuable insights gained from interacting with our students. The experience was truly enriching for us, and we hope it was equally enjoyable for you as well.

Before we proceed with our discussion today, I would like to inquire how you are doing this fine morning? <This message was edited>
26/2/24, 12:11 PM - +263 78 779 0133: We are all doing well....
26/2/24, 12:23 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. It has been a while since we last connected, and our team has had quite hectic past few days. As you already know, over the last weekend, Team Edoofa had been bustling with activity – both in India and Harare for the Meet and Greet '24. Now that things have settled down a bit, I wanted to express my sincere gratitude to you for participating in the event and playing a role in its success. I would like to share a few glimpses of the seminar with you, which demonstrates how enthusiastic and engaged our students were!

26/2/24, 12:24 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Your insights from the event are incredibly valuable, and I'm keen to hear about your experience. Would you be willing to share your thoughts, including your interest in attending similar events in the future and any suggestions for improvement? Moreover, if you've captured any memorable moments in photos, we would greatly appreciate it if you could share them with us.
26/2/24, 4:22 PM - +263 78 779 0133: I am sorry but I was caught up with school that I couldn't make with the event
27/2/24, 11:59 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Chiedza,

I hope you are doing well. I understand that you were unable to attend the event. You had previously mentioned that Joice's sister will be attending the event. Could you kindly share with me as to why she was unable to attend?
27/2/24, 12:06 PM - +263 77 277 0177: We are well. Chibuwe High School had no plans on the ground to release learners for this event because they had an audit exercise from the Ministry of Education. So as parents we could not bulldoze their programs
27/2/24, 12:08 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. In such a case, I would encourage you to go through the pictures and video that I had shared with you. I will share more details about the event with you later on. I hope that next time you will be able to join us for the experience and we look forward to hosting more such events in the future.
27/2/24, 12:08 PM - +263 77 277 0177: As for Joice's sister, we did not get the admission card for her despite having applied for it, so she stayed home
27/2/24, 12:10 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand. I believe I had shared the admit card with you on the night of 16th, as mentioned in the message above. Could you confirm if you were able to receive it?
27/2/24, 12:16 PM - +263 77 277 0177: Ummm shame maybe we got it late because of network challenges.  We sorry for that n hope to attend similar events next tym
27/2/24, 12:17 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. It is unfortunate that due to network challenges you were not able to receive the admit card details. Hopefully, next time we will be able to host you at our event. 

Before reaching out to you today, I was going through pictures and videos from Edoofa's very first SLICE CON held in January, and that sparked my curiosity about whether you are familiar with what SLICE CON is or not?
27/2/24, 12:23 PM - +263 77 277 0177: We not please let us know since its part of the Edoofa program.  Thank you in advance.
27/2/24, 12:27 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is alright, Let me tell you a bit about the same.  Recently, Edoofa hosted a conference called the Symposium of Leaders, Innovators, and Creators at Edoofa, also known as 'SLICE-CON.'
27/2/24, 12:27 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: The conference was attended by all the Edoofians of 2023 and a few senior Edoofians from previous batches. It focused on the art of creation, innovation, and, most importantly, the mindset required to make an impact in one's career.
27/2/24, 12:27 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: During this Industrial Visit and the conference - SLICE CON, Corporate leaders, such as the CEOs and Co-founders from renowned companies like Rage Coffee, Sirona Hygiene, Jolin New York, and more, shared their insights and experiences. These individuals are at the helm of multi-millionaire brands, leading large marketing teams. Their presence added immense value, providing students with the opportunity to engage in transformative conversations.
27/2/24, 12:27 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Let me share a glimpse of the conference with you and your family. I am certain that Chiedza too would be this excited to attend such events when he comes to India.

27/2/24, 12:27 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Let me know once you are able to go through the messages about the SLICE CON, along with the images and videos shared with you. This was indeed a momentous step for all of our students, making them employable ready and giving them access to the right opportunities for their careers ahead.
27/2/24, 12:37 PM - +263 77 277 0177: Yaaa that awful.  That's informative
27/2/24, 12:59 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Certainly. Also, regarding the discussion we had the other day about the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan, I wanted to follow up on our last conversation. Have you, as a family, been able to discuss it? If so, I would like to understand how the discussion went. What were their thoughts about it? Did they have any specific queries or concerns that you would like us to address?
27/2/24, 1:03 PM - +263 77 277 0177: No queries sir...we ready to start the first deposit of $150

Since you have been one of the most dedicated students, and I see you have great aspirations, I wanted you to be a part of the same set of students and start with your future planning the right way.
27/2/24, 1:12 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Also, as this plan commences from the month of February, for the efficient implementation of this plan, we need to decide on a fixed date on which you will deposit $150 every month. This will provide you with the flexibility to align your finances accordingly.
27/2/24, 1:12 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Our complete focus is on providing students and parents with the best ways to avail themselves of these opportunities. We understand that every parent may not be able to make the payment on our specified date. Therefore, considering this situation, we allow them to decide the payment date according to their comfort. In light of the same, may I know the fixed date every month on which you will deposit $150?
27/2/24, 1:21 PM - +263 77 277 0177: Before the end of every month. That is monthend. Thank you.
