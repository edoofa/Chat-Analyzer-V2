21/12/23, 8:20 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
21/12/23, 8:20 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
21/12/23, 8:27 PM - +263 78 688 6221: Yes,they are.
21/12/23, 8:59 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for being online and proceeding with the session with me for today. As my available hours are coming to an end I am closing our session for now and let us continue tomorrow properly. Have a great day and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
21/12/23, 9:01 PM - +263 78 688 6221: Thank you,same to you.
27/12/23, 7:45 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening dear parents and Grace. I hope this message finds you well and blessed. 

It has been a while. May I know if you are now ready to proceed with the session for your admission process?
27/12/23, 7:47 PM - +263 78 688 6221: Good evening
27/12/23, 7:47 PM - +263 78 688 6221: Yes l am.
27/12/23, 8:01 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. May I know if you were able to go through the above videos?
27/12/23, 8:05 PM - +263 78 688 6221: Yes
27/12/23, 8:18 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. So can you share your understanding of the 4 videos in detail with me?
27/12/23, 8:27 PM - +263 78 688 6221: From the four videos that l watched l understood that as an Edoofian one should be open minded and be teachable therefore must follow instructions being given .Edoofa's vision is also not just to get students  affordable and quality education and making students employed but  it is  also  there  to increase students capacity  for success through making students more responsible and successful.
27/12/23, 8:38 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. I did go through your responses and I can see you did understand all the videos. 

*Video 1: Important Message for Enrolled Students*

The first video underscores the importance of two crucial qualities: open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions. Edoofa's vision for its students is to foster success in their careers, and promote responsibility, and independence. A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.
27/12/23, 8:38 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s Vision for You*

Edoofa's vision for its students is to provide them with employment opportunities and the skills necessary to become future leaders. The program places students above other candidates by investing significant time and effort into finding reputable, education-focused institutions rather than solely business-oriented ones.
27/12/23, 8:38 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

In the third video, it is highlighted that Edoofa's founders have dedicated over a decade to meticulously identifying reputable educational institutions. Students are advised to cultivate the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to excel in the job market. All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to student's career goals.
27/12/23, 8:38 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools. It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.
27/12/23, 8:39 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: In summary, these videos emphasize the significance of qualities such as open-mindedness, following instructions, and cooperation. Edoofa's vision is to empower students for successful careers and leadership roles by carefully selecting educational institutions. The SOP is a vital tool for effective communication and admission success. 

I hope you agree with all of this and were able to understand these by watching the four videos?
28/12/23, 6:09 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening!

I hope you are having a wonderful evening with your family as we are approaching a New Year. May I know if you are ready to proceed with the session for the admission process?

28/12/23, 6:10 PM - +263 78 688 6221: Yes l am
28/12/23, 7:27 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Brilliant, Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.
28/12/23, 7:27 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by Tomorrow 6:30 PM.
28/12/23, 7:27 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: 1.

This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded.

29/12/23, 4:58 PM - +263 78 688 6221: *QUESTION 2* 



The Business Process Management (BPM) life cycle encompasses the systematic approach to managing and improving business processes within an organization. It typically consists of six key phases:

1. Design: This phase involves identifying, analyzing, and designing the organization's business processes to align with its strategic objectives. It includes mapping out current processes, identifying areas for improvement, and designing new processes to achieve efficiency and effectiveness.

2. Modeling: In this phase, process models are created to visually represent the flow, activities, and interactions within the business processes. Modeling tools such as flowcharts, swimlane diagrams, and BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation) are often used to document and communicate the processes.

3. Execution: Once the processes are designed and modeled, they are implemented and executed within the organization. This involves deploying the necessary technology, systems, and resources to support the execution of the processes.

4. Monitoring: The monitoring phase involves tracking and measuring the performance of the executed processes. Key performance indicators (KPIs) are used to assess process efficiency, identify bottlenecks, and ensure that the processes are delivering the desired outcomes.

5. Optimization: Based on the monitoring results, processes are continuously reviewed and optimized to enhance their performance. This phase involves identifying areas for improvement, making adjustments to the processes, and implementing best practices to achieve higher efficiency and effectiveness.

6. Automation: In this final phase, organizations may choose to automate certain aspects of the processes using technology solutions such as workflow management systems, business process management software, and robotic process automation (RPA) to streamline and standardize the execution of the processes.

Throughout the BPM life cycle, organizations strive to achieve greater agility, flexibility, and efficiency in their business processes, ultimately leading to improved overall performance and customer satisfaction.

29/12/23, 4:59 PM - +263 78 688 6221: **QUESTION 3* :How does business contribute to economic development* 



Businesses play a significant role in contributing to the economy through various means. Firstly, they generate income and employment opportunities, thus directly impacting the livelihoods of individuals and families. Businesses also contribute to economic growth by investing in infrastructure, innovation, and research and development, which in turn stimulate overall productivity and competitiveness. Furthermore, businesses pay taxes, thereby providing revenue to the government, which can be used for public services and infrastructure development.

An example of how business contributes to the economy is through the automotive industry. Car manufacturers and related businesses not only provide jobs to a large number of people, but they also stimulate economic activity in various other sectors, such as steel, rubber, electronics, and transportation. Additionally, the industry invests in research and development, leading to technological advancements and innovation. The taxes paid by these businesses further contribute to the government's revenue, which can be used for public services and infrastructure projects. Overall, the automotive industry's contribution exemplifies how businesses drive economic growth, create employment opportunities, and foster innovation and development.

29/12/23, 5:09 PM - +263 78 688 6221: *QUESTION 4* : *Explain with an example from your life which shows your managerial talent/skills 
* 


I successfully led a team to accomplish our objectives within a specified timeframe.

In this instance, I demonstrated my managerial talent by initiating and overseeing the project planning phase, which involved setting clear goals, assigning tasks based on team members' strengths, and establishing a timeline for completion. Through effective delegation and communication, I ensured that each team member understood their responsibilities and the overall project vision, thereby optimizing our collective efforts.

Furthermore, I actively monitored the project's progress, addressing any obstacles that arose and adjusting our strategies as necessary to maintain momentum. For instance, when we encountered a setback due to conflicting schedules, I facilitated open discussions with team members to identify feasible solutions, ultimately reassigning tasks and adjusting deadlines to accommodate everyone's availability without compromising the project's quality.

Moreover, my ability to cultivate a supportive and collaborative environment within the team was evident in my approach to conflict resolution and motivation. By acknowledging individual contributions, providing constructive feedback, and fostering a positive team dynamic, I effectively managed interpersonal relationships and inspired enthusiasm for our collective goals.

Ultimately, our project's successful completion within the designated timeframe and the positive feedback received from our peers and instructors serve as tangible evidence of my managerial talent and skills. This experience not only highlighted my ability to organize, coordinate, and lead a team but also underscored my proficiency in problem-solving, communication, and adaptability, all of which are integral to effective managerial prowess.

29/12/23, 5:12 PM - +263 78 688 6221: *QUESTION 5*:
 *Explain the importance of human resource in an Organization* 





Human resources play a crucial role in an organization's success and sustainability. Firstly, the HR department is responsible for recruiting, selecting, and retaining talented individuals who are essential for achieving the organization's goals. They ensure that the workforce is skilled, diverse, and well-suited to meet the demands of the job roles. Additionally, HR is instrumental in fostering a positive work culture and employee engagement, which directly impacts productivity, motivation, and overall job satisfaction.

Furthermore, human resources are responsible for developing and implementing policies and procedures that ensure compliance with labor laws and regulations, thus mitigating legal risks for the organization. They also administer employee benefits, manage performance evaluations, and provide training and development opportunities, all of which contribute to employee satisfaction and professional growth.

Moreover, HR plays a critical role in conflict resolution and employee relations, thereby maintaining a harmonious and productive work environment. They also act as a liaison between employees and management, addressing concerns and advocating for fair and ethical treatment.

In essence, the importance of human resources in an organization lies in their ability to attract, develop, and retain a high-performing workforce, while also ensuring legal compliance and fostering a positive work environment conducive to productivity and growth.

10/1/24, 2:13 PM - +263 78 688 6221: There are many things that inspire me in life, but one of the biggest inspirations for me are my parents .  They have  always been such  hard working  and positive parents, and they also  taught me the importance of perseverance and gratitude.  As for changes I would like to make, I'm working on being more organized and productive in my day-to-day life.  I've started using a planner and setting small, achievable goals for myself each day.
12/1/24, 11:19 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am delighted to hear that you are able to understand the hardships that parents go through to provide their children with opportunities and ensure that their children are raised with good values. I truly appreciate your parents for the same.

29/1/24, 4:44 PM - +263 78 688 6221: Good afternoon
29/1/24, 4:45 PM - +263 78 688 6221: Yes ,lm now available
29/1/24, 5:19 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for confirming that. I hope that you are doing good today, Grace. Moving forward in today's discussion, to confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is BBA and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2025. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
29/1/24, 7:06 PM - +263 78 688 6221: Yes that's accurate
30/1/24, 4:10 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Grace. I hope everything is well on your end. I was unable to respond to your message yesterday as our operational hours had concluded, however I am glad that we can reconnect today. Before we proceed with our discussion, I would like to check in on you and your family. How are you all doing today?
30/1/24, 4:41 PM - +263 78 688 6221: Good Afternoon .
30/1/24, 4:41 PM - +263 78 688 6221: We are all doing well ,thank you.
30/1/24, 5:45 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you are doing well. During our previous conversation, you confirmed your course and year of intake. Thank you for your confirmation. Based on our experience of over 14 years and having assisted over 5000 students from different countries, we have realized that financial planning is the most important factor when a student plans for their higher education abroad.
30/1/24, 5:45 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am sure that you must be aware that 20-30% of students who are admitted into universities abroad are unable to fulfill their dream and come to India due to a lack of financial planning. The funds needed for booking flights, accommodation, and covering living expenses after arrival often become overwhelming, leading to the decision to defer their admission for a year. This, in turn, creates a gap in the child's education.
30/1/24, 5:46 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: To assist both students and parents in this regard, Edoofa Management has designed a Financial Secure Plan that aims to help you prepare for your higher educational finances without experiencing stress or last-minute rushes. I believe you must be wondering about the details of the same plan and how it helps the parents?
31/1/24, 1:37 PM - +263 78 688 6221: Good afternoon
31/1/24, 1:38 PM - +263 78 688 6221: No lm not familiar with it.
31/1/24, 1:53 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Grace. I hope you are having a wonderful day. How are you all doing today?
31/1/24, 4:37 PM - +263 78 688 6221: We are all good thank you.
31/1/24, 5:17 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. In our previous conversation, we were discussing about the Financial Secure Plan. Edoofa Secure Plan is important for parents who have children joining the university for tertiary education in the next one to two years for several reasons:
31/1/24, 5:17 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 1. *Financial Preparedness:* The Edoofa Secure plan helps parents prepare financially for the costs after the Scholarship being offered so that they are not caught off guard.

2. *Reduced Financial Stress:* Having the Edoofa Secure Plan in place can significantly reduce the financial stress on you as parents when your child is about to enter university. Knowing that there is a dedicated fund for education expenses provides peace of mind.
31/1/24, 5:17 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 3. *Avoiding Debt*: Without proper savings, some parents may resort to taking out loans or accumulating credit card debt to cover their child's education costs. This Educational savings plan helps avoid the burden of debt and high-interest payments.

4. *Compound Interest:* By starting to save early and consistently contributing to the savings plan, parents can take advantage of compound interest, which can significantly increase the amount available for education expenses.
31/1/24, 5:17 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 5. *Flexibility and Control:* The Edoofa Secure savings plans allow parents to have greater control over their finances and how they allocate funds for their child's education. They can choose investment options that align with their risk tolerance and financial goals.

6. *Encouraging Responsibility*: Involving your child in the process of saving for their education teaches them financial responsibility and the value of higher education. It also motivates them to outperform in Academics.

6. *Encouraging Responsibility*: Involving your child in the process of saving for their education teaches them financial responsibility and the value of higher education. It also motivates them to outperform in Academics.
31/1/24, 5:17 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 7. *Adapting to Unexpected Changes*: Life is full of surprises, and circumstances can change especially when there are political reforms changing each day impacting the Local Currency. Having an Edoofa Secure Plan allows parents to adapt to unexpected changes in their financial situation while still prioritizing their child's education.

8. *Peace of Mind:* Overall, having the Edoofa Secure plan provides parents with peace of mind, knowing that they are actively planning for their child's future and increasing the likelihood of providing them with a solid education.
31/1/24, 5:17 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, when you go through all the above benefits, I am sure you can see that the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan is an important financial tool for parents/students who are supposed to enter the university soon. 

It helps ensure that the financial aspect of tertiary education is well-managed, reduces stress, and allows parents to provide the best opportunities for their children without resorting to debt or financial hardship. Isn't this something you and your family also wish to have?
1/2/24, 10:33 AM - +263 78 688 6221: Good morning
1/2/24, 10:34 AM - +263 78 688 6221: Ok ,that's wonderful
1/2/24, 11:29 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Grace. I hope you are all doing great today!

I am glad to hear that, as you are aware, we are currently in January 2024, and we have a good 20 months to plan for your finances before you start your university education in 2025.
1/2/24, 11:29 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: During the counseling session, you were informed that at Edoofa, we guarantee a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship on the tuition fees. Hence, the cost of education, including food and accommodation after the scholarship, would be between $2000-$3000, and it could be even less. Not more than that.
1/2/24, 11:29 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: This means that if you can save $150 per month for the next 20 months, you will be able to save $3000. This amount is more than enough for the first year of university fees, including tuition fees (if any), food, and accommodation. I hope you agree with this?
1/2/24, 11:52 AM - +263 78 688 6221: Yes, l agree
1/2/24, 1:40 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Right, this means that by the time you would be in India, you would have already saved the $3000 that will cover the first-year fee.
1/2/24, 1:40 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, in these next 20 months, I am sure you would also be engaged in the EWYL program, and if you secure a minimum of $1000 in 20 months, that means the fees for 1.5 years are already secured.
1/2/24, 1:40 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, for a 3-year course, if we follow the same approach for the remaining 1.5 years, the educational journey for the student and the financial journey for the parent will be easy and smooth. I believe you must be able to see this perspective?
1/2/24, 1:42 PM - +263 78 688 6221: Yes
1/2/24, 4:49 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. With that said, there is also another benefit, I am sure being in Zimbabwe you know how drastically the exchange rate fluctuates.
1/2/24, 4:50 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: If you are buying a dollar today, you might be spending 7000 bonds, but if you buy a dollar after a month, the rate would be different.
1/2/24, 4:50 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Also, even if you choose to buy dollars every month and save at your home, it is not safe since there is news of robbery, and mugging every day.
1/2/24, 4:50 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: In that case, you will opt to save in the Bank, but again we know that savings in the Bank require a Nostro Account which means you have to pay the bank to keep your money safe, right?
2/2/24, 4:37 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Grace.

I hope you are having a wonderful day. I was hoping to get a response from your end yesterday, however it seems like due to some reason we were unable to connect. May I know if everything is well on your end?
2/2/24, 4:39 PM - +263 78 688 6221: Good afternoon
2/2/24, 4:39 PM - +263 78 688 6221: Yes, everything is going well thank you.
2/2/24, 5:11 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. May I know if you were able to follow through with the details I shared with you during our last conversation?
2/2/24, 6:48 PM - +263 78 688 6221: Yes l did
2/2/24, 8:16 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. In such a case, let us reconnect tomorrow to further discuss the Financial Secure Plan.

I wish you a blessed night!
2/2/24, 8:17 PM - +263 78 688 6221: Thank you,same to you.
3/2/24, 11:41 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Grace. How are you all doing this fine morning?
3/2/24, 6:22 PM - +263 78 688 6221: We all doing well thank you ,how about you?
5/2/24, 4:07 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Grace.

I hope you all had a great weekend. I was unable to respond to your last text as our operational hours on Saturdays are from 8:00 AM to 1:00 PM. Before we proceed with our discussion, I would like to ask how is everything on your end today?
5/2/24, 4:07 PM - +263 78 688 6221: Good afternoon <This message was edited>
5/2/24, 4:08 PM - +263 78 688 6221: Everything is going well thank you.
5/2/24, 4:40 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. In our previous sessions, we were discussing the various constraints that students and parents face which cause about 20-30% of the students not being able to come to India for their higher education. Considering these constraints, Edoofa Management has decided to help the parents and students prepare for the journey way ahead of time by helping them save money with Edoofa without any additional charges but rather saving additional money as well. Do you want me to explain how this has been achieved?
5/2/24, 4:51 PM - +263 78 688 6221: Yes please
5/2/24, 5:24 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Program Fee (Enrollment Fee) that you were asked to pay is $350. Under the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan, a parent has to deposit a small amount of money which is $150 every month for the next 10 months. That means, in 10 months, the money saved will be $1500.
5/2/24, 5:24 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That means, in 10 months, the money saved will be $1500. When this money is saved, Edoofa will waive off $150 from the Edoofa Program/Enrollment Fee of $350, thereby making a straight saving of $150 in 10 months.
5/2/24, 5:24 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Imagine you paying $15 every month to the Bank of Zimbabwe to keep your money safe, and here Edoofa is paying you $15 every month to keep your money safe. Now, you must be wondering, why only for 10 months and not for 20 months, right?
5/2/24, 5:49 PM - +263 78 688 6221: Yes
6/2/24, 10:19 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Grace.

I hope you are all doing well today. Kindly excuse me for not being able to respond to your last message as our operational hours had concluded. I am pleased to hear that we are on the same page regarding the discussion. Before we proceed with our session today, I would like to ask how your day has been going so far?
6/2/24, 10:23 AM - +263 78 688 6221: Good morning to you too ,my day is going well so far thank you.
6/2/24, 10:44 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Allow me to proceed with our discussion -

If you see the bigger picture, you will realize that the reason is quite simple. Upon the completion of the 10 installments, the Edoofa Admissions team will initiate the Child’s Admission Process by applying early to the universities to secure their scholarship and their university seat.
6/2/24, 10:44 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Reserving seats earlier increases the chances of obtaining a maximum scholarship. A higher scholarship means lower fees, and by securing the seat, you will be entitled to pay the fees as per the old fee structure of the university, not the new one implemented in January 2025. Furthermore, when applying to the universities, you will receive an offer letter or a letter of intent detailing the fees, scholarship, and registration fees.
6/2/24, 10:44 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: As explained during the enrollment process, the registration fee is a portion of your first-year university fee, paid to reserve the seat. It ranges from $500-$1000 and is not an additional fee. 

From the $1500 you saved with Edoofa, the registration fee will be paid to the university, securing the seat. For instance, if the registration fee is $1000, Edoofa will pay $1000 from the $1500 saved in 10 months. The updated balance with Edoofa will be $500, which will be paid to the university upon your arrival in India.
6/2/24, 10:44 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: This eases the financial burden on the parent, as there is no immediate payment required upon the student's arrival. The $500 saved will cover the remaining fees for the semester/year, as specified in the offer letter from the university. What are your thoughts on this?
6/2/24, 2:44 PM - +263 78 688 6221: That's wonderful
6/2/24, 3:05 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to see that we are together so far. With this plan for the next 10 months, I am sure you must be wondering what will happen in the next 10 months, considering you have already secured your scholarship seat with the university due to your hard work in the first 10 months. Is my understanding correct?
6/2/24, 3:25 PM - +263 78 688 6221: Yes
6/2/24, 4:01 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Let me help you with that as well. In the 11th month, you will be guided to open an FBC Mastercard bank account in Zimbabwe with a deposit of $150. The reason for this is that when you apply for your student Visa, the Embassy asks for a Bank Statement, and this account will serve that purpose.
6/2/24, 4:01 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: We understand it might be expensive if you deposit another $1500 for the remaining 10 months in FB  Bank Zimbabwe, so to avoid the same challenges, we have designed the plan accordingly. You will only be depositing for the 11th, 12th, 13th, and 14th month, which is 4 months.
6/2/24, 4:01 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Once the 4 months are completed, our Department of Student Welfare (DSW) team will assist you with your visa process. The bank statement will act as one of the required documents, and once you receive the visa, you can withdraw the amount from FBC and book the flight ticket. This will help you utilize the money as well. How does it sound?
6/2/24, 4:32 PM - +263 78 688 6221: Very interesting
6/2/24, 4:53 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, from the 16th Month till the 20th month, considering it is a 6-month window, you can again continue depositing the money ($150) with Edoofa which can be used in the fee as and when required or you can decide to save this $900 of these 6 months with you as well. This is something which you are free to choose. I hope you have understood the financial secure plan now?
6/2/24, 6:29 PM - +263 78 688 6221: Yes clearly understood, thank you
7/2/24, 11:21 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Grace

I hope this message finds you well and filled with the same excitement that's buzzing here at Edoofa! It's that time of the year again when we eagerly anticipate our annual Meet and Greet Seminar in Harare. This event holds a special place in our hearts as it brings us closer to our community, and we're counting down the days with great anticipation!
7/2/24, 11:21 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Just like clockwork, we're gearing up for the seminar next week, and I couldn't resist sharing our enthusiasm with you. Your presence would truly make the event all the more meaningful, guiding you on your journey to India. Hence, with immense joy, we wanted to extend the special invitation for the Meet and Greet Seminar to you and your wonderful family.
7/2/24, 11:21 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: And in the process of doing the same, I happened to notice that you haven't started your EWYL Program by now. In light of this, I had a discussion with Ms. Sanjana, the head of the EWYL Department, and I am happy to share that she has graciously agreed to make a special exception for you, expediting your application process.
7/2/24, 11:21 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: As a result, I have gone ahead and created your very own dedicated EWYL Group - *Grace EWYL23E0988*, adding both you and your parents to the mix. If I have missed including any other family members, they can easily join using the following link: [https://chat.whatsapp.com/B5XH4kFhcpA0sxAUVOLYt4].

We are genuinely thrilled to witness you embark on this transformative journey, and we are rooting for your success every step of the way!

Warmest regards,
Admissions Team.

Help them understand its importance and details. Once you're done, we can reconnect, have a discussion, and address any queries you may have. After resolving your concerns, I'll guide you through starting your financial security plan. 

While most students can discuss this with their family the same day, I understand everyone is different. Could you let me know when you think you'll have the discussion with your family? This way, we can schedule our next session accordingly.
8/2/24, 6:33 PM - +263 78 688 6221: We were planning to discuss abt it tomorrow
9/2/24, 10:49 AM - +263 77 115 6713: Greetings to you all, l'm Grace Phiri's Father, firstly l would like to applaud you for trying to ease the plight faced by us parents especially when struggling to pay fees, indeed that is very good, but on my side Grace is the last born in which her sister who is in UK and myself are in a position of paying without any hustling 2025 is very far, month end that is when l will open her an account with FBC Bank as stated anyhow the family is willing for Edoofas Scholarship to be successful.
9/2/24, 11:05 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Grace,

I trust this message finds you well. Thank you for sharing your perspective on the Financial Secure Plan. Our team is dedicated to ensuring that every student can pursue higher education affordably. While I understand your ability to cover the registration fees without difficulty, I'd like to draw your attention to a crucial detail. Given that Grace's application profile will be processed under early-applications, securing your scholarship seat will require the payment of registration fees ($500 to $1000) in August 2024 upon receiving an offer letter. Given that August is only six months away, we introduced the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan for your consideration. May I know if you have also considered this timeline as well?
12/2/24, 4:16 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Grace,

As you already know, over the last weekend, Team Edoofa had been bustling with activity – both in India and Harare for the Meet and Greet '24. Now that things have settled down a bit, I wanted to express my sincere gratitude to you for participating in the event and playing a role in its success. I would like to share a few glimpses of the seminar with you, which demonstrates how enthusiastic and engaged our students were!
