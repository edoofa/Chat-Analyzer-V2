27/12/23, 1:02 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, dear parents and Tatenda!

I hope you are doing well and blessed today. It has been a while since the last time we were connected. I was occupied with the holidays. Please, how are you doing today and how was your holiday?
27/12/23, 1:05 PM - +263 77 643 4112: I am doing well . Thank you for reaching out.
27/12/23, 1:05 PM - +263 77 643 4112: My holiday was fine l did have a good experience
27/12/23, 1:12 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. May I know if you are now ready to proceed with the session?
27/12/23, 1:12 PM - +263 77 643 4112: Its oky we can proceed
27/12/23, 1:14 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
27/12/23, 1:16 PM - +263 77 643 4112: Yes l do agree
27/12/23, 1:17 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

*1. Reappear in A Level*

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
27/12/23, 1:17 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
27/12/23, 1:21 PM - +263 77 643 4112: Thank you l really understand  and feel  comforted
27/12/23, 1:21 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree*

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her interest in August 2024 itself.
27/12/23, 1:22 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
27/12/23, 1:23 PM - +263 77 643 4112: So after getting a deploma you can also be able to continue to bachelors degree with edoofa as well
27/12/23, 1:25 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is absolutely correct.
27/12/23, 1:25 PM - +263 77 643 4112: Oky thank you now l understad
27/12/23, 1:26 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career*

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
27/12/23, 1:26 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
27/12/23, 1:29 PM - +263 77 643 4112: I didnt get interms of certificates of various job-oroented projects
27/12/23, 1:31 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the concern with me. These are related to your EWYL projects and your session. For further detail, you can connect with your mentor. May I know if you are clear now?
27/12/23, 1:35 PM - +263 77 643 4112: Yaa am clear now thank you
27/12/23, 1:47 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: The admissions for the academic intake of August 2024 began last month, and as a result, students have already commenced their admission procedures.

I hope you are enthusiastic about getting the process underway. Presently, 37 students have already secured their scholarship seats and have benefitted from the Endowment Program, leaving 63 positions available for this month. 

Let's embark on our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you looking forward to the next steps and receiving this offer letter?
27/12/23, 1:52 PM - +263 77 643 4112: Yes l am please leats proceed
27/12/23, 1:53 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. With your approval, we will now proceed with the preparations for your application and submit it to the universities recommended by the academic board, tailored to his chosen course. Once we receive updates from the universities, we will promptly reconnect with you and share all the relevant information.

13/1/24, 9:40 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Amazing. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from MVN University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
13/1/24, 9:41 AM - +263 77 643 4112: And thank you for being available for me
13/1/24, 9:43 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion -

1. What is your per annum tuition fee after the scholarship?
2. What is your per annum accommodation fee after the sponsorship?
3. What is your annual fee at MVN University after the scholarship?
4. What are your  Sports and Misc. Fee (One-Time payable)
5. What is the Admission and Processing Fee to be paid to secure your scholarship seat?
13/1/24, 9:54 AM - +263 77 643 4112: 1.Tuition fee per annum $350
2. Accommodation fee per annum is $0
3.annual fee at MVN university after scholarship $1600
4.sports and Misc fee one time payed $125
5. Admission and processing fee $1000
13/1/24, 10:26 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for providing the details. As per the offer letter, MVN University has awarded a 90% scholarship on tuition fees. This is a significant achievement and will greatly reduce the financial burden on your family.

Also, coming to the accommodation fees, as you can see in the letter, he has also been awarded a 100% waiver on the accommodation expenses, this means that the accommodation provided will be free of cost throughout the stay at MVN University. This is a fantastic opportunity as it further contributes to making education more affordable, isn’t it?
13/1/24, 10:29 AM - +263 77 643 4112: Yes it is
13/1/24, 10:33 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: However, there is a small correction I would like to make here, dear. The *Sports and Misc. Fee (One-time payable)* are 2 different components, i.e., column H and column I. Hence, the total of both components will be $250. I hope I am clear?
13/1/24, 10:36 AM - +263 77 643 4112: Oky thank you for the correction
13/1/24, 10:37 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to see that. As you can see in the offer letter from MVN University, after the scholarship on the tuition and sponsorship fee on accommodation fee, the remaining per annum cost of education that you would have to pay is:

1. Tuition Fee: $350
2. Accommodation Fee: $0
3. University Infrastructure Fee: $575
4. International Student Development Fund: $300
5. Examination Fee (Per Year): $125
6. EDP & Book Bank Fee: $250
13/1/24, 10:38 AM - +263 77 643 4112: Well noted thank you
13/1/24, 10:41 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: With this, if you sum up all the components, you will be able to see that your per annum cost of education is $1600.

At the same time, as you see in the offer letter, there are two components for the first year that are one-time payments, which are the Sports Fee and the Misc. Fee. This means the total expenses for the first year amount to $1600 (tuition) + $250 (fees) = $1850.

It is important to note that this cost is applicable for the first year only. From the second year onwards, your annual cost of education will be $1600. I hope this clarifies things in a better way for you?
13/1/24, 10:50 AM - +263 77 643 4112: Its so clear thank you
13/1/24, 10:58 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Glad to hear that. If you have any questions on your mind or need further clarification, please feel free to bring them up. Also, now that you're aware of your per annum fee, let me share the list of facilities offered by the universities that are covered as per the university's fee structure:

1. Tuition Fee
2. Living Cost
3. Library Fee
4. Examination Fee
5. EDB and Book Bank
6. International Student Development Fund

17/1/24, 12:31 PM - +263 77 643 4112: Good afternoon Ms Siddhi .

I am ready to do our discussion
17/1/24, 12:57 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Tatenda. How are you all doing today?
17/1/24, 1:01 PM - +263 77 643 4112: I am doing well today
17/1/24, 1:04 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. May I know if you are ready to continue with our discussion?
17/1/24, 1:19 PM - +263 77 643 4112: Yes l am ready
17/1/24, 1:33 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Amazing to hear that. Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $1850, let me also guide you on how we can make your education more affordable.

Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
17/1/24, 1:33 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn. 

The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. Is this clear to you?
17/1/24, 1:37 PM - +263 77 643 4112: Thank you for allowing me to know this and l am doing my EWYL sessions already
17/1/24, 2:20 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, dear. Now, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that with hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.
17/1/24, 2:20 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: With these earned credits, one can use this $1000 to cover a portion of your annual fee, which is $1600. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $1600 - $1000 = $600, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.

17/1/24, 2:21 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This illustrates how you can effectively make your education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
17/1/24, 2:54 PM - +263 77 643 4112: Thank you
17/1/24, 2:54 PM - +263 77 643 4112: I have a question

17/1/24, 3:26 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am impressed to know that you were doing your research, and I am proud to share the LPU is one of the universities that Edoofa is associated with. If you wish to get admission into LPU, then you are definitely on the right path. We have already shared your application with LPU and are waiting for an update from their end. Since the A-Level results have been released recently, they are receiving a lot of applications and it is taking them some time to revert to us with an update. <This message was edited>
17/1/24, 3:30 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This message was deleted
17/1/24, 3:34 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: However, as your admission officer, I must highlight that you were able to achieve a high quantum of scholarship from MVN University. Such might not be the case with LPU. Hence, let us proceed with our discussion regarding your offer letter from MVN University so that you are able to secure your scholarship seat along with availing the Endowment Program Benefits.
17/1/24, 9:35 PM - +263 77 643 4112: Oky thank you

18/1/24, 4:19 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand, dear. Being in your position, concerns related to finances are very valid and reasonable. However, in order to understand your situation better and assist you to the best of my capabilities, I want to ask whether you are currently facing any challenges or issue that make you think that you will be unable to make the payment in the stipulated time?

If you are available right now, we can proceed with our discussion regarding your Offer Letter from MVN and ensure that you are able to secure your scholarship seat.
20/1/24, 8:28 AM - +263 77 643 4112: Good morñing Ms Siddhi

20/1/24, 1:03 PM - +263 77 643 4112: I am doing well Ms Siddhi

20/1/24, 1:11 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am happy to hear that, dear. Before we proceed with our discussion, I would like to ask you whether you are still concerned about having financial issues?
20/1/24, 1:14 PM - +263 77 643 4112: Yes as l said we my family is not being able to pay registration  with such a short space of time
20/1/24, 1:19 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand, dear. You had previously mentioned the same. May I know what it is that is troubling you? I am only asking so that I can understand your situation better and I am able to provide you with a suitable solution.
20/1/24, 1:22 PM - +263 77 643 4112: Oky l once shared my situation with my counsellor Ms Pallika
20/1/24, 1:22 PM - +263 77 643 4112: Anyways let me also share with you
20/1/24, 1:29 PM - +263 77 643 4112: My father passed away when l was age of 1 year and l grew up with my mother and my siblings , we are 3 boys now , we were 4 boys before but the first  born in my family passed away 2018. So the second born in my family Mr Nelson was the one who was looking after our family all this time . 

Now the challenge is he got ill in 2021 when  he got kidney failure and he lost his job , all his savings he then used it to do kidney transplant operation  and my other Mr Edwin he was the one who donated  kidney for him. The operantion took place there in India at Max hospital.
20/1/24, 1:34 PM - +263 77 643 4112: Now since after this experience everything  is now down to our side😭and my mum also she doesnt go to work to support us , after all she doesnt have any profession.

 So currently my brothers they are not working that is even the reason why l choosed to look for a scholarship for me to get help and l was hoping that maybe l was going to get 100%  but l appreciate that edoofa is willing to help me .
20/1/24, 1:37 PM - +263 77 643 4112: We even struggle to pay enroment fee of $350  last year ..that was the reason why we asked for payment schedule.  And now being honest they is no way we are going to be able to raise $1000 in such a short space of time😞
20/1/24, 2:16 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am sorry to hear that Tatenda. You have been through a lot of hardships in your life, and the loss of a family member is the kind of pain that is difficult to recover from. However, you also have the assistance of your siblings who have been trying their level best to support your education. It is commendable that you have been able to pull through this situation. You are not unaware of the kind of hardships and challenges that life tends to throw at us. Being able to push through these situations and coming out stronger is what shapes the person into a successful one.
20/1/24, 2:21 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Your brothers have been working hard in order to earn money to support your family. However, given the economical condition of your country, the pay is not substantial no matter how hard you work for it. When you first enrolled into the Edoofa program, I am sure that you came here with a mindset to achieve your higher education goals and become successful in life someday. I believe that it is still the same? With our combined hard work and dedication, you were able to secure a 90% scholarship on your tuition fees and 100% scholarship on your accommodation. If you are able to capitalise on this opportunity, you will not only be able to pursue your dream education, but, with our guidance and the support of the EWYL team, you will also be presented with amazing job opportunities which will help you stabilize and support the financial situation of your family. I hope we are together in this?
20/1/24, 2:23 PM - +263 77 643 4112: Yes l understands
20/1/24, 2:32 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Moreover, we did not get an opportunity to discuss the entire offer letter and also the Endowment Benefits that you would get from Edoofa. If you are available right now to discuss the same, I will explain the payment plan that you can avail under the Endowment Program, and I think you might feel a little more comfortable with the same once I have explained it to you.
20/1/24, 2:35 PM - +263 77 643 4112: We can discuss  more about it
20/1/24, 2:42 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Alright please. Let us reconnect in 1 hour to discuss the same, as I have to attend a meeting right now.
20/1/24, 2:44 PM - +263 77 643 4112: Oky noted
21/1/24, 8:25 AM - +263 77 643 4112: Greetings to you Ms Siddhi
22/1/24, 8:12 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Tatenda. I apologize for not being able to reach out to you again on Saturday, as the meeting went on for a bit long and then my operational had concluded. However, I am glad that we can connect today to proceed with our discussion regarding Tatenda's admission journey. Before we begin, I would like to ask how you and your family are doing today?
22/1/24, 8:27 AM - +263 77 643 4112: Good morning .
We are doing welp
22/1/24, 8:27 AM - +263 77 643 4112: Yes please we can proceed
22/1/24, 8:30 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you are all doing well. During our last conversation about the letter discussion, I was explaining how the EWYL program can be advantageous and help you self-finance your education along with gaining employability skills. May I know if you were able to follow the details until this point? If you have any queries, kindly let me know so that I can assist you with the same. <This message was edited>
22/1/24, 8:35 AM - +263 77 643 4112: No l dont have any queries ,you did explained well
22/1/24, 8:35 AM - +263 77 643 4112: Buy l once heard that EWYL does not cover up registration fee
22/1/24, 8:42 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: The registration fee is part of your annual fee for the university. In order to secure your seat at the university, you are required to pay the registration amount. Once you are enrolled into the Edoofa scholarship program, you will have the opportunity cover your remaining balance amount and your future fees. Like you already know, there is no upper limit to gaining scholarship credits. Hence, you will have the opportunity to self-finance your future expenses. I hope this was helpful?
22/1/24, 8:45 AM - +263 77 643 4112: Yes thank you but l query last time was that do you have any payment sechudle that you can help me with because we are not not able to cover the registration fee in few days left
22/1/24, 8:45 AM - +263 77 643 4112: We dont have the money now
22/1/24, 8:47 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Yes, dear. Allow me to proceed with the discussion. Let us now shift our focus to the registration fee of $1000 mentioned in your offer letter from MVN University. 

The registration fee we are discussing here is somewhat unique, especially for Edoofians. Unlike traditional international students, Edoofa students do not need to consider it as an additional cost to their annual education fees.
22/1/24, 8:49 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Instead, it is considered a part of the first-year education cost. For you, the cost for your first year of education is $1850 and thus the registration fee of $1000 will be adjusted towards the same. Giving you a total of $850 for your university fees. I hope I am clear to you?
22/1/24, 8:49 AM - +263 77 643 4112: Yes that is the registration  l am talking about  that we not able to afford $1000 as it was mention in the offer letter ..and they said within  15 days and am sure now we have less than 7 days left
22/1/24, 8:50 AM - +263 77 643 4112: Thank you l did understand and you once explained that to me .
22/1/24, 8:52 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand dear. However, in order to proceed with the explanation of the payment plan, I will need to explain the rest of the aspects of the letter to you so that you have a better understanding of the payment you are making. Be rest assured, that I will explain the payment plan to you shortly. I hope we are together in this?
22/1/24, 8:53 AM - +263 77 643 4112: Oky we can proceed
22/1/24, 8:57 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I appreciate your understanding Tatenda. Now, I hope you recall that the per annum cost of education and the registration fee figures you mentioned were supposed to face a range of $2,000 to $3,000 for the annual cost of education and a registration fee between $500 and $1000.
22/1/24, 8:57 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: However, based on the discussions we had with your career counselor and their assessment of your application, they encouraged us to secure a higher quantum of scholarship for you. This is the reason the per annum cost of education is only $1600, which is significantly less than the general cost of education fee range ($2000 to $3000).
22/1/24, 8:57 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: When you look at this opportunity, with a higher quantum of scholarship, the registration fee may also appear a bit higher. Rest assured, this does not increase your financial burden, as it is an integral part of your first year of education cost and will be utilized for the same purpose. I hope this makes sense?
22/1/24, 8:58 AM - +263 77 643 4112: Yes it is <This message was edited>
22/1/24, 9:07 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: In continuation of our discussion, I also want to emphasize that this scholarship opportunity for you is exclusive and highly beneficial. Besides this scholarship offer, it is unlikely that you will find a more affordable and high-quality education. 

Certainly, there are other universities that may assess your scholarship qualifications, and with those, the cost of education may fall within the specified range I mentioned earlier.
22/1/24, 9:07 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: In light of this, I would like to pose a question to you: Would you prefer a scholarship offer that allows you to save at least $850 annually, even if it entails a higher registration fee? Or would you opt for a scholarship offer that forces you to pay a higher cost of education but with a lower registration fee, bearing in mind that the registration fee is part of the first-year expenses?
22/1/24, 9:07 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: It's essential to consider the big picture and the overall financial benefits that come with the scholarship offer you have received. Do you not agree with this?
22/1/24, 9:15 AM - +263 77 643 4112: But the quality  of education will it still be the same or l will end up getting  low quality education
22/1/24, 9:19 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: The quality of education you will get is definitely not going to be compromised. Based on the evaluation of your application profile, the university has decided to offer you a high quantum of scholarship. Be rest assured that there will be no compromise on the quality of education you will receive, as Edoofa ensures to do a quality check with the universities we are associated with. I hope this was helpful Tatenda?
22/1/24, 9:20 AM - +263 77 643 4112: This is helpful
22/1/24, 9:20 AM - +263 77 643 4112: Thank you
22/1/24, 9:20 AM - +263 77 643 4112: I gues the one that will offer me a low registration  fee will be affordable  to me
22/1/24, 9:32 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now talking about the registration fee, as mentioned previously, the admission and processing fee of $1,000 specified in your offer letter will be adjusted against the first-year expenses of $1,850. Consequently, the amount you'll need to pay after you  arrive in India will be $1,850 - $1,000 = $850 and is to be paid within three days of your arrival to India. 

As you can see in the offer letter, it's outlined that a student is required to submit a registration fee of $1000 within 15 days to secure their scholarship seat with the university. This sets the *deadline date as January 26th, 2024*.
22/1/24, 9:32 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: However, in reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $100 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
22/1/24, 9:36 AM - +263 77 643 4112: Yes please explain more
22/1/24, 9:41 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Given the $100 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent you will be responsible for the remaining $900 of the registration fee. This $900 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of $450 before the first deadline date of *January 26th, 2024* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of $450 before the second deadline date of *February 26th, 2024* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
22/1/24, 9:41 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to *make the full payment of $900 within 15 working days, before January 26th, 2024*. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
22/1/24, 9:44 AM - +263 77 643 4112: Oky thank you l will have a discussion with my family and l will get back to you
22/1/24, 9:46 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Very well, dear. Before you take your leave, allow me to share the payment details with you for your easy reference.
22/1/24, 9:46 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
22/1/24, 9:47 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Hence, there are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
22/1/24, 9:47 AM - +263 77 643 4112: I stay in harare
22/1/24, 9:48 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
22/1/24, 9:48 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
22/1/24, 9:48 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
22/1/24, 9:49 AM - +263 77 643 4112: Oky thank you
22/1/24, 9:51 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: You are most welcome. Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.
22/1/24, 9:51 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
22/1/24, 9:51 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Shorwi's FBC Bank for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Kindly go through the following account details for your reference -
22/1/24, 9:51 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: If making the payment through Mr. Shorwi is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

26/1/24, 5:11 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: It is quite alright. It's wonderful to hear that you've had a family discussion about the offer letter, and I am confident that you must all be delighted to witness the positive strides being made toward realizing your higher education goals in India.

As you move forward, I am curious to know how your family conversation went. What are your thoughts and feelings regarding the discussion?
26/1/24, 5:15 PM - +263 77 643 4112: They really did liked the university  but for now we have failed to raise the money
26/1/24, 5:15 PM - +263 77 643 4112: Am afraid we might miss this opportunity
26/1/24, 8:10 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I appreciate that you are being honest with me about your financial situation. Rest assured, I am here as your admission officer to help you out to the best of my abilities. I understand that you are facing difficulties in arranging finances for your higher education. However, your admission process began in the month of October last year, am I correct? Could you help me understand how you have been planning for the finances for your higher education in the past 4 months?
26/1/24, 8:24 PM - +263 77 643 4112: Yaa my admision process started in october and then my parents we try their best to raise money for enrolment feee . So they we budget for it and am sure even if you ask my mento we even fail to meet the deadline of enrolment fee which was 28 nov because as l mention noone is working they have been struggling
26/1/24, 8:26 PM - +263 77 643 4112: So we finished the enrolment fee in december and after that my parents there we now starting to cover our some gaps and to pay some credits they made to pay the enrolment fee and this january they are starting from zero trying to raise registration fee .
26/1/24, 8:32 PM - +263 77 643 4112: And *to be honest its hard for us because the pressure you are giving and your deadlines  mmm its so tight* ,and l gues l will be able to find another offer letter because today its 26 January  and we have fail to raise the $450 which is almost   you asked us to pay <This message was edited>
26/1/24, 8:43 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand Tatenda. Since my operational hours for the day have ended and I have had a very long day, allow me some time to discuss this with my team and I will get back to you by tomorrow. I am sure that together we will be able to come up with a solution for the same. I wish you a blessed night!
26/1/24, 8:49 PM - +263 77 643 4112: Like its lot of money to cover up in 15 days like $450 its almost 37000 rupee and l am sure you can understand that its lot of money to raise in such short space of time. 
To my other brother its even more than his monthly salary.
29/1/24, 9:16 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Tatenda. I hope you are doing well. May I know if you are available to discuss your offer letter currently?
29/1/24, 10:59 AM - +263 77 643 4112: Good morning yes l am ready to proceed
29/1/24, 11:03 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand your concerns related to the finances and I agree that $450 is not a small amount. However, I must highlight it to you Tatenda that you have received a very high quantum of scholarship. In terms of the payment plan, we at Edoofa are providing you with the flexibility of paying the registration amount in 2 installments. Since you have not been able to pay the registration fee on the deadline date, may I know if you had been preparing for the same since we last talked about it?
29/1/24, 11:08 AM - +263 77 643 4112: Yes l was preparing the same
29/1/24, 11:14 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: May I know how much of the amount were you able to raise Tatenda?
31/1/24, 8:39 AM - +263 77 643 4112: Greetings Ms Siddhi
31/1/24, 10:05 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Tatenda. How are you doing today?
31/1/24, 11:38 AM - +263 77 643 4112: Am doing well how are you
31/1/24, 12:01 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I'm pleased to hear that you're doing well. Regarding our earlier discussion, I understand that the payment deadline on January 26 was challenging for you due to financial difficulties. The amount involved is indeed significant along with the constraints you are facing. To better assist you, could you please provide information on the portion of the total amount you were able to raise, Tatenda?
1/2/24, 9:28 AM - +263 77 643 4112: Good morning Ms Siddhi  am very so for not communicating yesterday, but today l am available
1/2/24, 11:17 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Tatenda. I hope you are doing well today. I understand please. May I know if you were able to go through my previous message?

1/2/24, 11:44 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thanks for letting me know. In such a case, could you let me know what was the amount that you were able to raise for your registration fees?
1/2/24, 12:05 PM - +263 77 643 4112: Being honest now we are still trying to find some funds
1/2/24, 2:10 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. Could you kindly share why you were unable to accumulate the amount and what are your next steps going to be for your higher education?
1/2/24, 5:14 PM - +263 77 643 4112: Maam things are very tight to my side
2/2/24, 10:28 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. I understand that your financial conditions are not favourable currently. In such a case, if you could share what part of the registration fee you were able to raise, I will try to help you to the best of my abilities. If you wish to ensure that you are able to secure the seat you were offered, I will need your cooperation. I hope we are together in this?
