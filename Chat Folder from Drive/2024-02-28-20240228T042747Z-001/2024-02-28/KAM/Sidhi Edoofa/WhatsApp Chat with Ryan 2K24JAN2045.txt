10/2/24, 3:50 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 1. The admissions group *(Ryan 2K24JAN2045)*  will be the platform where we, as your admission officers, will be communicating with you. This group is dedicated to all-important discussions like your university admission process, offer letter discussion, and ultimately your university registration and reservation of your scholarship along with the Visa process. This group will continue to assist you with your admission-related queries while you are here in India.
10/2/24, 3:50 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 2. Earn While You Learn Program *(Ryan EWYL23E1249)* . In this group, your EWYL mentor, head of the department, and head coach will be present.

This group will keep a record of the tasks and projects you undertake. You will be provided with the link to the group after the completion of the admission process session and on the dedicated date for your EWYL session, where you will be able to directly speak to your EWYL mentor. I hope you are clear about the purpose of the two groups.
10/2/24, 8:57 PM - +263 78 739 4878: Good day
10/2/24, 8:59 PM - +263 78 739 4878: I understand the role each group takes on and l believe l am well informed moving on
12/2/24, 8:16 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Ryan.

I hope you had a wonderful weekend. Thank you for letting me know that. Before we proceed with our session, I would like to inquire, how are things on your end today?
12/2/24, 10:01 AM - +263 78 238 4237: Good morning! We are all doing well.how are you? Hope you also had a great weekend
12/2/24, 10:05 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. I had a great weekend, thank you for asking. Moving forward in today's session, we will discuss a bit about your university admission journey. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts. I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them.

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
12/2/24, 10:07 AM - +263 78 238 4237: Sure we can start
12/2/24, 10:08 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
12/2/24, 1:16 PM - +263 78 238 4237: You can kindly explain
12/2/24, 1:43 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
12/2/24, 1:43 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
13/2/24, 11:07 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Ryan.

I hope you are doing great. I was hoping to get a response from your end yesterday, but it seems due to some reason we were unable to connect with each other. However, I am glad that we can reconnect today for our scheduled session. Before we proceed, I would like to inquire how are things with you today?
13/2/24, 11:14 AM - +263 78 238 4237: Good morning to you too mam !tyank you for checking on us we are fine thank you, how are you today?
13/2/24, 11:15 AM - +263 78 238 4237: The first two steps you sent are clear
13/2/24, 11:28 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. I am doing good, thank you for asking. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps - 

*Step 3: Introduction to the Financial Secure Plan* - Parents with children embarking on their university journey within the next one to two years face important decision-making and rigorous financial planning. Edoofa recognizes the significance of this transition and hence has introduced the Edoofa Secure Plan - a unique and systematic strategy to empower parents in financial planning and preparing for their child's tertiary education well in advance.
13/2/24, 11:28 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Scholarship Offer Letter from the university would be issued next year in the month of August.

I hope you are following?
13/2/24, 1:10 PM - +263 78 289 6896: Good afternoon, yes we are clear on this
13/2/24, 1:12 PM - +263 78 289 6896: Well explained here
13/2/24, 1:41 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. The registration fee will be paid through the savings you have accumulated visa the Financial Secure Plan.
