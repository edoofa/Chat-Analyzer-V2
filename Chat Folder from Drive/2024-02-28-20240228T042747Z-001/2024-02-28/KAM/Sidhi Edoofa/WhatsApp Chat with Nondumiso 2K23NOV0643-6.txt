26/2/24, 11:44 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Nondumiso,

I hope you had a wonderful weekend. Over the weekend, our team engaged in discussions regarding the Meet and Greet Seminar, reflecting on the valuable insights gained from interacting with our students. The experience was truly enriching for us, and we hope it was equally enjoyable for you as well.

Before we proceed with our discussion today, I would like to inquire how you are doing this fine morning?
26/2/24, 4:11 PM - +263 71 130 5140: We are doing good thanks for asking…l hope you are well too
27/2/24, 12:37 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Nondumiso,

I hope you are doing well today. Kindly excuse me for not being able to respond to your last message as I was not feeling well and had to conclude my day early. However, I am pleased to let you know that I am feeling better today and eager to proceed with our discussion. Before we do so, I would like to ask how your day has been going so far?
27/2/24, 3:13 PM - +263 71 130 5140: I’m so glad to hear that you are feeling better …please get well soon …we are doing good this side
27/2/24, 3:35 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for your concern please, I appreciate it. I am pleased to hear that you are doing good. It has been a while since we last connected, and our team has had quite hectic past few days. As you already know, over the last weekend, Team Edoofa had been bustling with activity – both in India and Harare for the Meet and Greet '24. Now that things have settled down a bit, I wanted to express my sincere gratitude to you for participating in the event and playing a role in its success. I would like to share a few glimpses of the seminar with you, which demonstrates how enthusiastic and engaged our students were!

27/2/24, 3:35 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Your insights from the event are incredibly valuable, and I'm keen to hear about your experience. Would you be willing to share your thoughts, including your interest in attending similar events in the future and any suggestions for improvement? Moreover, if you've captured any memorable moments in photos, we would greatly appreciate it if you could share them with us.
27/2/24, 3:42 PM - +263 71 130 5140: Sorry …l didn’t manage to attend the event due to a number of reasons
27/2/24, 3:48 PM - +263 71 130 5140: Thank you so much for sharing the glimpses of the serminar with me and l can clear see how enthusiastic your students were…and I’m very happy about it
27/2/24, 4:09 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand that you were unable to attend the event. I surely hope that you will be able to join us for our next event and we will get an opportunity to meet with you in-person.

During our previous discussions, you had mentioned that you wish to proceed with the Financial Secure Plan, however, you want to begin from the month of March. Could you kindly confirm the same?
27/2/24, 4:13 PM - +263 71 130 5140: Hopefully l will be able to join you next time …if l may ask is there any other option besides this
27/2/24, 4:13 PM - +263 71 130 5140: I mean beside paying $150 for 10 months
27/2/24, 4:17 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: The plan has been provided to you to ensure that we are able to consistently save in small amounts towards Nondumiso's higher education funds. As you might be aware, we will be processing Nondumiso's profile under early applications for the 2025 intake. In such a case, the registration fees due towards securing the scholarship seat will be due in the month of August. We want to ensure that you do not face any last minute burdens due to the finances. 

The Financial Secure Plan is flexible, and if you wish to make alterations to it, kindly feel free to suggest the same. Our end goal is to ensure that we are able to save $1500 towards Nondumiso's education by the end of December. I hope we are together in this?
27/2/24, 5:14 PM - +263 71 130 5140: Okay l understand
27/2/24, 5:20 PM - +263 71 130 5140: So we have to pay $150 every month right…then my question is are we supposed to pay this amount on a fixed date or we can pay it any time during the month as long as l pay it every month
27/2/24, 5:21 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: We will require you to provide us with a fixed date which will be considered as a deadline for your monthly installments. The deadlines are set to designate a final payment date. You have the flexibility to make the payment anytime between the previous and the upcoming deadline. I hope this helps with your query?
27/2/24, 5:22 PM - +263 71 130 5140: Okay it is now clear
27/2/24, 5:23 PM - +263 71 130 5140: So what if we fail to follow the deadline
27/2/24, 5:24 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. If, for any reason, you are unable to make the payment before the deadline due to insufficient funds, I kindly request you to inform us about the same beforehand so that we can work together to find a solution. In the event of missing the deadline, a small penalty charge will be applied.
27/2/24, 5:24 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: For the current round of students, there are only 9 seats available for the students who can benefit from the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan. 

Since you have been one of the most dedicated students, and I see you have great aspirations, I wanted you to be a part of the same set of students and start with your future planning the right way.
27/2/24, 5:24 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Also, as this plan commences from the month of February, for the efficient implementation of this plan, we need to decide on a fixed date on which you will deposit $150 every month. This will provide you with the flexibility to align your finances accordingly.
27/2/24, 5:24 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Our complete focus is on providing students and parents with the best ways to avail themselves of these opportunities. We understand that every parent may not be able to make the payment on our specified date. Therefore, considering this situation, we allow them to decide the payment date according to their comfort. In light of the same, may I know the fixed date every month on which you will deposit $150?
27/2/24, 5:27 PM - +263 71 130 5140: Currently we haven’t discussed this as a family so may you kindly give us one night to talk about this…l will get back to you tomorrow
