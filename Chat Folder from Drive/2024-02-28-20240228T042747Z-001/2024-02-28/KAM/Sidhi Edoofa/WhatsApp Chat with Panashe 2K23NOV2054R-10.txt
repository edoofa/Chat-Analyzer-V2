19/12/23, 7:08 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening!

I hope you are doing well and blessed today. Please excuse me for the late reply. I was occupied with a university official today. May I know if you are available to proceed with our session?
19/12/23, 7:10 PM - +263 77 623 2165: Yes I am Mr Shivjeet thank you , we can proceed
19/12/23, 7:26 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. let us move forward with our discussion. To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is BA LLB and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2025. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
19/12/23, 7:28 PM - +263 77 623 2165: Yes it is accurate Mr Shivjeet
19/12/23, 7:49 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. Based on our experience of over 14 years and having assisted over 5000 students from different countries, we have realized that financial planning is the most important factor when a student plans for his/her higher education abroad.
19/12/23, 7:49 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am sure that you must be aware that 20-30% of students who are admitted into universities abroad are unable to fulfill their dream and come to India due to a lack of financial planning. The funds needed for booking flights, accommodation, and covering living expenses after arrival often become overwhelming, leading to the decision to defer their admission for a year. This, in turn, creates a gap in the child's education.
19/12/23, 7:49 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: To assist both students and parents in this regard, Edoofa Management has designed a Financial Secure Plan that aims to help you prepare for your higher educational finances without experiencing stress or last-minute rushes. I believe you must be wondering about the details of the same plan and how it helps the parents?
19/12/23, 8:09 PM - +263 77 623 2165: Yes I am
19/12/23, 8:49 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Edoofa Secure Plan is important for parents who have children joining the university for tertiary education in the next one to two years for several reasons:

*Financial Preparedness:* The Edoofa Secure plan helps parents prepare financially for the costs after the Scholarship being offered so that they are not caught off guard.

*Reduced Financial Stress:* Having the Edoofa Secure Plan in place can significantly reduce the financial stress on you as parents when your child is about to enter university. Knowing that there is a dedicated fund for education expenses provides peace of mind.

*Avoiding Debt*: Without proper savings, some parents may resort to taking out loans or accumulating credit card debt to cover their child's education costs. This Educational savings plan helps avoid the burden of debt and high-interest payments.

*Compound Interest:* By starting to save early and consistently contributing to the savings plan, parents can take advantage of compound interest, which can significantly increase the amount available for education expenses.
19/12/23, 8:49 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Flexibility and Control:* The Edoofa Secure savings plans allow parents to have greater control over their finances and how they allocate funds for their child's education. They can choose investment options that align with their risk tolerance and financial goals.

*Encouraging Responsibility*: Involving your child in the process of saving for their education teaches them financial responsibility and the value of higher education. It also motivates them to outperform in Academics.

*Adapting to Unexpected Changes*: Life is full of surprises, and circumstances can change especially when there are political reforms changing each day impacting the Local Currency. Having an Edoofa Secure Plan allows parents to adapt to unexpected changes in their financial situation while still prioritizing their child's education.

*Peace of Mind:* Overall, having the Edoofa Secure plan provides parents with peace of mind, knowing that they are actively planning for their child's future and increasing the likelihood of providing them with a solid education.
19/12/23, 8:49 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, when you go through all the above benefits, I am sure you can see that the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan is an important financial tool for parents/students who are supposed to enter the university soon.
19/12/23, 9:00 PM - +263 77 623 2165: I definitely agree with Edoofa Financial Secure Plan it is the backbone for parents /students
19/12/23, 9:03 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for being online and proceeding with the session with me for today. As my available hours are coming to an end I am closing our session for now and let us continuw tomorrow. Have a great day and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
21/12/23, 6:35 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening, dear parents and Panashe!

I hope this message finds you well and blessed. May I know if you are currently available so that we can proceed with the session for your admission process?
21/12/23, 7:55 PM - +263 77 623 2165: How are you Mr Shivjeet sorry for the late reply, am ready for the session
21/12/23, 8:11 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. May I know if you were able to go through the above vidoes?
21/12/23, 8:11 PM - +263 77 623 2165: Yes Mr Shivjeet
21/12/23, 8:14 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. So can you share your understanding of the 4 videos in detail with me?
21/12/23, 8:21 PM - +263 77 623 2165: What I have understood after watching the videos is that the student should follow instructions and listen to experts as well as the elevation of levels when the co-founder illustrated a cup and a tank holding different capacity of water. Also learnt that the co-founders play a parental role in ensuring students there get quality education by enrolling them in the best schools, colleges and universities. In the universities the Edoofa program provides EWYL in those universities ensuring that the student is able to master the concepts of being independent and hard work which will later pay off when they attain their degree and they pursue their desired career which will make them  different from the other students who did not do their internship through the EWYL program. And the Edoofa program is there to empower the vision of the students and facilitating the education system which will later pay off when there acquire their degrees.
21/12/23, 8:22 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. I did go through your responses and I can see you did understand all the videos. 

*Video 1: Important Message for Enrolled Students*

The first video underscores the importance of two crucial qualities: open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions. Edoofa's vision for its students is to foster success in their careers, and promote responsibility, and independence. A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.
21/12/23, 8:22 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s Vision for You*

Edoofa's vision for its students is to provide them with employment opportunities and the skills necessary to become future leaders. The program places students above other candidates by investing significant time and effort into finding reputable, education-focused institutions rather than solely business-oriented ones.
21/12/23, 8:22 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

In the third video, it is highlighted that Edoofa's founders have dedicated over a decade to meticulously identifying reputable educational institutions. Students are advised to cultivate the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to excel in the job market. All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to student's career goals.
21/12/23, 8:22 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools. It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.
21/12/23, 8:22 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: In summary, these videos emphasize the significance of qualities such as open-mindedness, following instructions, and cooperation. Edoofa's vision is to empower students for successful careers and leadership roles by carefully selecting educational institutions. The SOP is a vital tool for effective communication and admission success. 

I hope you agree with all of this and were able to understand these by watching the four videos?
21/12/23, 8:28 PM - +263 77 623 2165: Yes I agree Mr Shivjeet
21/12/23, 8:59 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for being online and proceeding with the session with me for today. As my available hours are coming to an end I am closing our session for now and let us continue tomorrow properly. Have a great day and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
21/12/23, 9:03 PM - +263 77 623 2165: Same to you Mr Shivjeet thank you so much
27/12/23, 7:44 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening dear parents and Panashe. I hope this message finds you well and blessed. 

It has been a while. May I know if you are now ready to proceed with the session for your admission process?
27/12/23, 8:10 PM - +263 77 623 2165: Yes Mr Shivjeet how are you
27/12/23, 8:28 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am great, thank you for asking.
27/12/23, 8:28 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. Based on our experience of over 14 years and having assisted over 5000 students from different countries, we have realized that financial planning is the most important factor when a student plans for his/her higher education abroad.

I believe you must be wondering about the details of the same plan and how it helps the parents?
27/12/23, 9:02 PM - +263 77 623 2165: Sorry for saying this but I believe we did the session some days ago Mr Shivjeet
27/12/23, 9:11 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for being online and proceeding with the session with me for today. As my available hours are coming to an end I am closing our session for now and let us continue tomorrow properly again. Have a great day and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
28/12/23, 6:10 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening!

I hope you are having a wonderful evening with your family as we are approaching a New Year. May I know if you are ready to proceed with the session for the admission process?
28/12/23, 6:39 PM - +263 77 623 2165: Yes I am Mr Shivjeet thank you
28/12/23, 7:59 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. May I know if you are ready to proceed with the session for the admission process?
28/12/23, 8:40 PM - +263 77 623 2165: Yes I am Mr Shivjeet
28/12/23, 9:12 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for being online and proceeding with the session with me for today. As much as I wanted to proceed with the session my available hours are coming to an end I am closing our session for now and let us continue tomorrow properly again. Have a great day and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.

29/12/23, 6:14 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening!

I hope you are doing well today. May I know if you are currently available to proceed with the session for the admission process?
29/12/23, 6:19 PM - +263 77 623 2165: Yes I am Mr Shivjeet
29/12/23, 6:37 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the payment receipt of your university Enrollment Fee. It has been duly noted with us and we have shared it with the accounts team as well for payment confirmation. 

Once the payment is confirmed by the accounts team and the amount has been reflected in India, we will notify you accordingly.
29/12/23, 6:45 PM - +263 77 623 2165: Dully noted
29/12/23, 9:19 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
30/12/23, 8:27 AM - +263 77 623 2165: Thank you for the best wishes Mr Shivjeet
2/1/24, 6:36 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Eevning dear parent and my dear student!

I hope you had your wonderful holidays with your loved ones. As we embark on a furitful fresh new year. May I know if you are now reay to proceed with the session for the admisison process for today?
3/1/24, 3:43 PM - +263 77 623 2165: Good afternoon Mr Shivjeet sorry for not responding to the message you sent yesterday I had a family emergency.
3/1/24, 5:53 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening!

I hope you are doing well and blessed. I was not available by the time you connected as it was past my available hours. May I know if you are currently available to proceed with the session?
3/1/24, 5:58 PM - +263 77 623 2165: Yes I am available Mr Shivjeet
4/1/24, 9:14 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening!

I hope you are doing a fine evening today. I would like to let you know that I was not able to further connect with you recently as I was occupied with multiple calls with the university. To make up for this let us connect tomorrow at 6:00 PM for further process for our session.
4/1/24, 11:11 PM - +263 77 623 2165: Thank you for the update Mr Shivjeet
5/1/24, 6:08 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening!

I hope you are doing well today. How are you doing this lovely evening?
5/1/24, 6:32 PM - +263 77 623 2165: Am okay thank you Mr Shivjeet
5/1/24, 6:33 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. May I know if you are currently available for a session?
5/1/24, 6:33 PM - +263 77 623 2165: Yes Mr Shivjeet we can proceed
5/1/24, 6:39 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. I am sharing you with the Edoofa secure plan for now.
5/1/24, 6:39 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Edoofa Secure Plan is important for parents who have children joining the university for tertiary education in the next one to two years for several reasons:

*Financial Preparedness:* The Edoofa Secure plan helps parents prepare financially for the costs after the Scholarship being offered so that they are not caught off guard.

Now, when you go through all the above benefits, I am sure you can see that the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan is an important financial tool for parents/students who are supposed to enter the university soon. 

It helps ensure that the financial aspect of tertiary education is well-managed, reduces stress, and allows parents to provide the best opportunities for their children without resorting to debt or financial hardship. Isn't this something you and your family also wish to have?
5/1/24, 6:41 PM - +263 77 623 2165: Yes we do
5/1/24, 6:42 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through the above points, do you want me to help you understand how the Edoofa Secure Plan works?
5/1/24, 6:43 PM - +263 77 623 2165: Yes Mr Shivjeet
5/1/24, 7:05 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, as you are aware, we are currently in January 2024, and we have a good 20-21 months to plan for your finances before you start your university education in 2025.
5/1/24, 7:06 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: During the counseling session, you were informed that at Edoofa, we guarantee a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship on the tuition fees. Hence, the cost of education, including food and accommodation after the scholarship, would be between $1200-$1800, and it could be even less. Not more than that.
5/1/24, 7:06 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: This means that if you can save $150 per month for the next 20 months, you will be able to save $3000. This amount is more than enough for the first year of university fees, including tuition fees (if any), food, and accommodation. I hope you agree with this?
5/1/24, 7:13 PM - +263 77 623 2165: Yes I agree Mr Shivjeet thank you
5/1/24, 7:13 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Right, this means that by the time you would be in India, you would have already saved the $3000 that will cover the first-year fee.
5/1/24, 7:13 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, in these next 20 months, I am sure you would also be engaged in the EWYL program, and if you secure a minimum of $1000 in 20 months, that means the fees for 1.5 years are already secured.
5/1/24, 7:13 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, for a 3-year course, if we follow the same approach for the remaining 1.5 years, the educational journey for the student and the financial journey for the parent will be easy and smooth. I believe you must be able to see this perspective?
5/1/24, 7:16 PM - +263 77 623 2165: Yes I am Mr Shivjeet
5/1/24, 7:52 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. With that said, there is also another benefit, I am sure being in Zimbabwe you know how drastically the exchange rate fluctuates.
5/1/24, 7:52 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: If you are buying a dollar today, you might be spending 7000 bonds, but if you buy a dollar after a month, the rate would be different.
5/1/24, 7:52 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Also, even if you choose to buy dollars every month and save at your home, it is not safe since there is news of robbery, and mugging every day.
5/1/24, 7:52 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: In that case, you will opt to save in the Bank, but again we know that savings in the Bank require a Nostro Account which means you have to pay the bank to keep your money safe, right?
5/1/24, 8:07 PM - +263 77 623 2165: Yes Mr Shivjeet that's right
5/1/24, 8:13 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is great to hear, considering these constraints, Edoofa Management has decided to help the parents and students prepare for the journey way ahead of time by helping them save money with Edoofa without any additional charges but rather saving additional money as well. Do you want me to explain how this has been achieved?
5/1/24, 8:16 PM - +263 77 623 2165: Yes Mr Shivjeet please do
5/1/24, 8:56 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Under the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan, a parent has to deposit a small amount of money which is $150 every month for the next 10 months. That means, in 10 months, the money saved will be $1500.
5/1/24, 8:56 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Imagine you paying $15 every month to the Bank of Zimbabwe to keep your money safe, and here Edoofa is paying you $15 every month to keep your money safe. Now, you must be wondering, why only for 10 months and not for 20 months, right?
5/1/24, 10:34 PM - +263 77 623 2165: Yes i am Mr Shivjeet
6/1/24, 12:02 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa added Dev Edoofa
6/1/24, 12:07 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Morning, Parents of Panashe,

I am *Mr. Shivjeet, and I serve as the Admission Officer at Edoofa.* I wanted to extend my heartfelt wishes to you and your family for a prosperous and fulfilling 2024. 

I firmly believe that with the commencement of this new year, comes the promise of fresh beginnings, guiding the way for the actualization of one's deepest dreams and aspirations. As we stand on the threshold of this promising year, I am filled with excitement for the adventures it holds.
6/1/24, 12:07 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: In the same spirit, I would like to share that I am embarking on a journey as I prepare myself to pursue my doctorate and take a step forward in my academic pursuits. This transition marks a significant chapter in my life as I will be bidding farewell to the cherished moments at the Admissions Team in Edoofa.

Over the past year, having the privilege of supporting numerous students, including you, in your pursuit of higher education has been truly rewarding. Witnessing our students thrive and excel in their dream universities and colleges has brought immense satisfaction.
6/1/24, 12:07 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: The decision to transition to a new phase in my life presents an incredible opportunity for me to continue contributing to the lives of students, ensuring their academic journey and overall experience remain enriched and fulfilling.

As I embark on this new journey, I want to assure you that I have entrusted your application file to capable hands. From this point forward, your admission journey will be seamlessly guided by one of our accomplished admission officers, *Mr. Dev,* who will connect with you on Monday.  I hope you will make yourself available for the further procedures and will give your best to your career.
6/1/24, 12:07 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I extend my heartfelt wishes for your continued success and a bright future filled with educational accomplishments. Wish you all the best, and God Bless.

Regards,
Mr. Shiveet
Edoofa Admission Team.
6/1/24, 1:50 PM - +263 77 623 2165: Thank you so much same applies with you Mr Shivjeet
9/1/24, 9:24 PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Panashe,

I am *Mr. Dev Kumar, Admission Officer at Edoofa* and I am honored to assume the responsibilities previously held by Mr. Shivjeet. I will be guiding you toward realizing your dream education with Edoofa. I am confident that together, we can ensure a promising start to your educational journey, leading to the right employment opportunities and ultimately, success for you and your family.
9/1/24, 9:24 PM - Dev Edoofa: In the past few days, I had an in-depth discussion with Mr. Shivjeet and had the opportunity to review your scholarship application file in our records. Through this process, I gained valuable insights into your dreams and aspirations to advance your academic career. Upon reviewing your application file, I was both impressed and reassured to assist you in achieving these goals here in India, which will unlock doors to incredible opportunities in the future.
9/1/24, 9:24 PM - Dev Edoofa: Before we get into the specifics of your admission journey and talk about your admission process, I would like to share an exciting milestone that India as a country achieved within the first week of 2024 – the successful India's Chandrayaan-3 Engine Test. This accomplishment is responsible for the third lunar mission, aiming to land a rover on the Moon's south polar region and conduct scientific studies that could check Moon's viability to sustain life. It signifies a significant scientific advancement, laying the groundwork for future progress.
9/1/24, 9:24 PM - Dev Edoofa: This achievement has not only pushed boundaries but also inspired young minds all over the world to pursue their dreams. On the same note, I wanted to extend my heartiest wishes for the New Year to you and your family and check in to see how you and your family started your year?
10/1/24, 8:09 AM - +263 77 623 2165: Good morning Mr Dev Kumar it's a pleasure to know you and the progress that is been made by India and am sorry for not responding to your message I was attending a family emergency
12/1/24, 9:23 AM - Dev Edoofa: No need to worry, @263776232165. I hope you are excited for the new day and most importantly the new year as well. @263776232165 , the new year brings about a transformative mindset in us which may not emphasize immediate changes but a change in the direction that you believe is needed.

If I talk about myself, I have made a resolution to bring more humility in myself and bring about a change in my perspective to be a better version of myself all while ensuring that I help all of our students to achieve their educational goals. With that said, I would like to know what aspirations or a change in your approach towards life you wish to achieve?
12/1/24, 4:15 PM - +263 77 623 2165: I wish to attain my degree and then form a law firm and establish a legacy of greatness and justice
12/1/24, 8:25 PM - Dev Edoofa: I appreciate your such big aspirations and I have immense faith in you that you will succeed.
12/1/24, 8:25 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, moving towards the admission process, We, at Edoofa, are determined to provide affordable higher education to hardworking students and assist them in launching their careers to greater heights. We will be able to help you only if we can connect timely and have healthy discussions.
12/1/24, 8:25 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, this is something I want to inform you all that the agenda for the discussions, that we are going to have, is to help you all understand the process you will undertake for his university admission journey and what your family will be experiencing with the Edoofa Scholarship Program over the next one and a half years. However, since you are going to be occupied with school and your parents are occupied with work during the day, it seems that the same challenge in connectivity is going to persist for the next couple of months as well.
12/1/24, 8:25 PM - Dev Edoofa: With that being said, what I can do right now to solve this constraint is give you the freedom to choose the time slot for our sessions over the next 10 days [till 20th January]. This way, we can align it with our availability as well and help you move forward and make progress in a streamlined manner. Could you please let me know at what time you would be available from Monday to Friday between 08:00 AM and 06:00 PM? This would help us factor in your input and find the right time for our sessions.
12/1/24, 8:47 PM - +263 77 623 2165: 06:00 PM I will be available Mr Dev Kumar
26/1/24, 6:52 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa added Sidhi Edoofa
26/1/24, 9:34 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Panashe,

I am *Ms. Siddhi Singh, Admission Officer at Edoofa*. Recently I was having a discussion with the Academic Board. They highlighted  that you have not been able to proceed with your admission process in a timely manner, since your child is at school and you have been occupied with work. Hence, I pitched in that I will be able to help you out and take over your application profile so that together we can ensure a timely and smooth progress. Since my operational hours accommodate your timings more suitably, I will be assuming the duties of your admission officer. I am optimistic that together, we can pave the way for an auspicious beginning to your academic journey, resulting in the right career prospects and eventual success for both you and your family.
26/1/24, 9:34 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Today, on India's 75th Republic Day, I want to extend warm regards to you and your family!

27/1/24, 12:09 PM - +263 77 623 2165: Yes it is Ms Siddhi
27/1/24, 12:49 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for confirming that. May I know if you have any queries or thoughts regarding the process up until know?
27/1/24, 1:10 PM - +263 77 623 2165: It's all good thanks
27/1/24, 2:14 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that. I understand that Panashe has school during the weekdays and you are occupied with work. In such a case, I want to ensure that our sessions are held in a timely and smooth manner so we can comfortably proceed with your application process. Could you kindly suggest a 1-hour slot between 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM when we can have our sessions?
27/1/24, 2:30 PM - +263 77 623 2165: 5.00 PM I will be free Ms Siddhi
27/1/24, 3:08 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Our operational hours end at 5:00 PM. May I know if you will be able to take out 1 hour's time during the day in order to have the sessions with me?
27/1/24, 3:08 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This is to ensure that we are able to make smooth and timely progress in Panashe's admission process.
27/1/24, 3:45 PM - +263 77 623 2165: 4.00 PM will be good
27/1/24, 4:41 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for confirming that. In such a case, we will conclude today's conversation and reconnect on Monday at 4:00 PM to further discuss the financial plan and application process. Until then, please take care and kindly extend my regards to your family as well.
27/1/24, 5:34 PM - +263 77 623 2165: Same with you too Ms Siddhi thanks
29/1/24, 4:14 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Panashe. I hope you are all doing well today. How has your day been going so far?
29/1/24, 4:38 PM - +263 77 623 2165: It's good  thank you
29/1/24, 5:13 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Moving forward in today's discussion, to confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is BA LLB and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2025. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
29/1/24, 5:38 PM - +263 77 623 2165: Yes it is accurate sorry for the late reply
29/1/24, 5:52 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for confirming that. As much as I would like to continue with our discussion, since my operational hours for the day have already concluded, I would like to reconnect with you tomorrow at our scheduled time to further discuss the Financial Secure Plan and admission process. Until then, please take care and have a blessed day ahead!
30/1/24, 4:16 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Panashe.

I hope everything is well on your end. Before we proceed with our discussion, I would like to check in on you and your family. How are you all doing today?
30/1/24, 4:26 PM - +263 77 623 2165: We are doing okay thank you
30/1/24, 5:18 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. I am doing well too, thank you for asking. During our previous conversation, you had confirmed your course and year of intake. Thank you for your confirmation. Based on our experience of over 14 years and having assisted over 5000 students from different countries, we have realized that financial planning is the most important factor when a student plans for their higher education abroad.
30/1/24, 5:18 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am sure that you must be aware that 20-30% of students who are admitted into universities abroad are unable to fulfill their dream and come to India due to a lack of financial planning. The funds needed for booking flights, accommodation, and covering living expenses after arrival often become overwhelming, leading to the decision to defer their admission for a year. This, in turn, creates a gap in the child's education.
30/1/24, 5:19 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: To assist both students and parents in this regard, Edoofa Management has designed a Financial Secure Plan that aims to help you prepare for your higher educational finances without experiencing stress or last-minute rushes. I believe you must be wondering about the details of the same plan and how it helps the parents?
30/1/24, 6:00 PM - +263 77 623 2165: Yes I am Ms Siddhi
30/1/24, 6:25 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I would love to continue with our discussion, however, my operational hours for the day have concluded. Let us reconnect tomorrow at our scheduled time to further discuss the admission process. I wish you a blessed day ahead!
30/1/24, 6:28 PM - +263 77 623 2165: Same to you
31/1/24, 4:24 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Panashe.

I hope you are having a wonderful day. How are you all doing today?
31/1/24, 5:01 PM - +263 77 623 2165: We are doing alright thank you  Ms Siddhi sorry for the late reply
31/1/24, 5:54 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Continuing our previous conversation, allow me to introduce you to the Financial Secure Plan. Edoofa Secure Plan is important for parents who have children joining the university for tertiary education in the next one to two years for several reasons: <This message was edited>
31/1/24, 5:55 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 1. *Financial Preparedness:* The Edoofa Secure plan helps parents prepare financially for the costs after the Scholarship being offered so that they are not caught off guard.

2. *Reduced Financial Stress:* Having the Edoofa Secure Plan in place can significantly reduce the financial stress on you as parents when your child is about to enter university. Knowing that there is a dedicated fund for education expenses provides peace of mind.
31/1/24, 5:55 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 3. *Avoiding Debt*: Without proper savings, some parents may resort to taking out loans or accumulating credit card debt to cover their child's education costs. This Educational savings plan helps avoid the burden of debt and high-interest payments.

4. *Compound Interest:* By starting to save early and consistently contributing to the savings plan, parents can take advantage of compound interest, which can significantly increase the amount available for education expenses.
31/1/24, 5:55 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 5. *Flexibility and Control:* The Edoofa Secure savings plans allow parents to have greater control over their finances and how they allocate funds for their child's education. They can choose investment options that align with their risk tolerance and financial goals.

6. *Encouraging Responsibility*: Involving your child in the process of saving for their education teaches them financial responsibility and the value of higher education. It also motivates them to outperform in Academics.
31/1/24, 5:55 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 7. *Adapting to Unexpected Changes*: Life is full of surprises, and circumstances can change especially when there are political reforms changing each day impacting the Local Currency. Having an Edoofa Secure Plan allows parents to adapt to unexpected changes in their financial situation while still prioritizing their child's education.

8. *Peace of Mind:* Overall, having the Edoofa Secure plan provides parents with peace of mind, knowing that they are actively planning for their child's future and increasing the likelihood of providing them with a solid education.
31/1/24, 5:55 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, when you go through all the above benefits, I am sure you can see that the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan is an important financial tool for parents/students who are supposed to enter the university soon. 

It helps ensure that the financial aspect of tertiary education is well-managed, reduces stress, and allows parents to provide the best opportunities for their children without resorting to debt or financial hardship. Isn't this something you and your family also wish to have?
1/2/24, 4:20 PM - +263 77 623 2165: Yes it is
1/2/24, 4:20 PM - +263 77 623 2165: Good afternoon Ms Siddhi
1/2/24, 4:58 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Panashe.

I hope you are all doing great today. Kindly excuse me for the delay in my response as our team is currently engaged in the preparations for our upcoming Zimbabwe trip in February. Before we proceed with out discussion, I would like to ask how your day has been going so far?
1/2/24, 4:59 PM - +263 77 623 2165: It was great thank you
2/2/24, 4:55 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Pearl.

I hope you are having a wonderful day. Before we proceed with our discussion, I would like to ask how are you doing today?
2/2/24, 8:43 PM - +263 77 623 2165: Sorry for the late response I was busy with the EMA club today
3/2/24, 9:15 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Pearl.

I understand please. Thank you for letting me know. How are you all doing this fine morning?
3/2/24, 9:26 AM - +263 77 623 2165: We are doing okay thank you
3/2/24, 9:33 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. During our previous discussion, I shared with you a few details about the Financial Secure Plan.  Now that you have gone through the points, do you want me to help you understand how the Edoofa Secure Plan works?
3/2/24, 10:07 AM - +263 77 623 2165: Yes Please
3/2/24, 10:29 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, as you are aware, we are currently in February 2024, and we have a good 20 months to plan for your finances before you start your university education in 2025.
3/2/24, 10:29 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: During the counseling session, you were informed that at Edoofa, we guarantee a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship on the tuition fees. Hence, the cost of education, including food and accommodation after the scholarship, would be between $2000-$3000, and it could be even less. Not more than that.
3/2/24, 10:29 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: This means that if you can save $150 per month for the next 20 months, you will be able to save $3000. This amount is more than enough for the first year of university fees, including tuition fees (if any), food, and accommodation. I hope you agree with this?
3/2/24, 10:33 AM - +263 77 623 2165: Yes I do agree Ms Siddhi
3/2/24, 10:42 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Right, this means that by the time you would be in India, you would have already saved the $3000 that will cover the first-year fee.
3/2/24, 10:42 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, in these next 20 months, I am sure you would also be engaged in the EWYL program, and if you secure a minimum of $1000 in 20 months, that means the fees for 1.5 years are already secured.
3/2/24, 10:42 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, for a 3-year course, if we follow the same approach for the remaining 1.5 years, the educational journey for the student and the financial journey for the parent will be easy and smooth. I believe you must be able to see this perspective?
3/2/24, 11:10 AM - +263 77 623 2165: Yes I am Ms Siddhi
3/2/24, 11:15 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. With that said, there is also another benefit, I am sure being in Zimbabwe you know how drastically the exchange rate fluctuates.
3/2/24, 11:15 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: If you are buying a dollar today, you might be spending 7000 bonds, but if you buy a dollar after a month, the rate would be different.
3/2/24, 11:15 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Also, even if you choose to buy dollars every month and save at your home, it is not safe since there is news of robbery, and mugging every day.
3/2/24, 11:15 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: In that case, you will opt to save in the Bank, but again we know that savings in the Bank require a Nostro Account which means you have to pay the bank to keep your money safe, right?
3/2/24, 12:34 PM - +263 77 623 2165: Yes Ms Siddhi it will be safe
3/2/24, 12:59 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is great to hear. Considering these constraints, Edoofa Management has decided to help the parents and students prepare for the journey way ahead of time by helping them save money with Edoofa without any additional charges but rather saving additional money as well. Do you want me to explain how this has been achieved?
3/2/24, 3:17 PM - +263 77 623 2165: Yes Ms Siddhi sorry for the late response
5/2/24, 4:27 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Panashe.

I hope you all had a great weekend. How is everything on your end today?
5/2/24, 5:45 PM - +263 77 623 2165: It's okay thank you am so sorry for the late reply I had to attend a funeral service of one of my classmate's mother
6/2/24, 10:18 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Panashe.

I hope you are all doing well today. I understand please, thank you for letting me know that. I understand that such times can be quite difficult and heavy. I hope that your classmate is able to gather the strength to pull through this tough situation.

In future, if you have any preoccupations during our designated session timings, kindly let me know beforehand so that I am able to reschedule our session accordingly and ensure that we are able to make timely progress with our discussions. I hope we are together in this?
6/2/24, 5:11 PM - +263 77 623 2165: It's okay thank you so much
6/2/24, 5:18 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: You are most welcome. May I know if you were unavailable during the timeslot of our scheduled session?
6/2/24, 5:47 PM - +263 77 623 2165: Yes I was unavailable due to the course of the procedures of the funeral service
6/2/24, 5:50 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. I would like to continue with our discussion however my operational hours ended at 5:00 PM. Hence, let us conclude our conversation for today and we will reconnect at our scheduled time tomorrow to continue with our discussion.

Have a blessed evening!
6/2/24, 6:00 PM - +263 77 623 2165: Thank you so much Ms Siddhi
7/2/24, 11:12 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Panashe

I hope this message finds you well and filled with the same excitement that's buzzing here at Edoofa! It's that time of the year again when we eagerly anticipate our annual Meet and Greet Seminar in Harare. This event holds a special place in our hearts as it brings us closer to our community, and we're counting down the days with great anticipation!
7/2/24, 11:12 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Just like clockwork, we're gearing up for the seminar next week, and I couldn't resist sharing our enthusiasm with you. Your presence would truly make the event all the more meaningful, guiding you on your journey to India. Hence, with immense joy, we wanted to extend the special invitation for the Meet and Greet Seminar to you and your wonderful family.
7/2/24, 11:12 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: And in the process of doing the same, I happened to notice that you haven't started your EWYL Program by now. In light of this, I had a discussion with Ms. Sanjana, the head of the EWYL Department, and I am happy to share that she has graciously agreed to make a special exception for you, expediting your application process.
7/2/24, 11:12 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: As a result, I have gone ahead and created your very own dedicated EWYL Group - *Panashe EWYL23E0970*, adding both you and your parents to the mix. If I have missed including any other family members, they can easily join using the following link: [https://chat.whatsapp.com/CHgHPBdKvCj6CwLVzNmhmS].

Within the group, the EWYL team will not only guide you on the hows and whens of the EWYL Program but also share all the exciting details about the upcoming Meet and Greet Seminar in Harare. We are genuinely thrilled to witness you embark on this transformative journey, and we are rooting for your success every step of the way!

Warmest regards,
Admissions Team.
7/2/24, 11:40 AM - +263 77 623 2165: Thank you so much for the info Ms Siddhi
7/2/24, 1:01 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: You are most welcome. During our previous sessions, we were discussing about the various constraints that the students and parents face due to which they are unable to proceed with their admission process. Considering these constraints, Edoofa Management has decided to help the parents and students prepare for the journey way ahead of time by helping them save money with Edoofa without any additional charges but rather saving additional money as well. Do you want me to explain how this has been achieved?
7/2/24, 1:14 PM - +263 77 623 2165: Yes please
7/2/24, 1:54 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Program Fee (Enrollment Fee) that you were asked to pay is $350. Under the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan, a parent has to deposit a small amount of money which is $150 every month for the next 10 months. That means, in 10 months, the money saved will be $1500.
7/2/24, 1:55 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That means, in 10 months, the money saved will be $1500. When this money is saved, Edoofa will waive off $150 from the Edoofa Program/Enrollment Fee of $350, thereby making a straight saving of $150 in 10 months.
7/2/24, 1:55 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Imagine you paying $15 every month to the Bank of Zimbabwe to keep your money safe, and here Edoofa is paying you $15 every month to keep your money safe. Now, you must be wondering, why only for 10 months and not for 20 months, right?
7/2/24, 3:16 PM - +263 77 623 2165: Yes Ms Siddhi
7/2/24, 3:20 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: If you see the bigger picture, you will realize that the reason is quite simple. Upon the completion of the 10 installments, the Edoofa Admissions team will initiate the Child’s Admission Process by applying early to the universities to secure their scholarship and their university seat.
7/2/24, 3:20 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Reserving seats earlier increases the chances of obtaining a maximum scholarship. A higher scholarship means lower fees, and by securing the seat, you will be entitled to pay the fees as per the old fee structure of the university, not the new one implemented in January 2025. Furthermore, when applying to the universities, you will receive an offer letter or a letter of intent detailing the fees, scholarship, and registration fees.
7/2/24, 3:20 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: As explained during the enrollment process, the registration fee is a portion of your first-year university fee, paid to reserve the seat. It ranges from $500-$1000 and is not an additional fee. 

From the $1500 you saved with Edoofa, the registration fee will be paid to the university, securing the seat. For instance, if the registration fee is $1000, Edoofa will pay $1000 from the $1500 saved in 10 months. The updated balance with Edoofa will be $500, which will be paid to the university upon your arrival in India.
7/2/24, 3:20 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This eases the financial burden on the parent, as there is no immediate payment required upon the student's arrival. The $500 saved will cover the remaining fees for the semester/year, as specified in the offer letter from the university. What are your thoughts on this?
7/2/24, 4:27 PM - +263 77 623 2165: It is a good offer because my mother will save $150 for ten months
7/2/24, 4:46 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Indeed. I am glad to see that we are together so far. With this plan for the next 10 months, I am sure you must be wondering what will happen in the next 10 months, considering you have already secured your scholarship seat with the university due to your hard work in the first 10 months. Is my understanding correct?
7/2/24, 4:50 PM - +263 77 623 2165: Yes it is
7/2/24, 5:00 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Let me help you with that as well. In the 11th month, you will be guided to open an FBC Mastercard bank account in Zimbabwe with a deposit of $150. The reason for this is that when you apply for your student Visa, the Embassy asks for a Bank Statement, and this account will serve that purpose.
7/2/24, 5:00 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: We understand it might be expensive if you deposit another $1500 for the remaining 10 months in FB  Bank Zimbabwe, so to avoid the same challenges, we have designed the plan accordingly. You will only be depositing for the 11th, 12th, 13th, and 14th month, which is 4 months.
7/2/24, 5:00 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Once the 4 months are completed, our Department of Student Welfare (DSW) team will assist you with your visa process. The bank statement will act as one of the required documents, and once you receive the visa, you can withdraw the amount from FBC and book the flight ticket. This will help you utilize the money as well. How does it sound?
7/2/24, 5:07 PM - +263 77 623 2165: It sounds great thanks
7/2/24, 5:34 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, from the 16th Month till the 20th month, considering it is a 6-month window, you can again continue depositing the money ($150) with Edoofa which can be used in the fee as and when required or you can decide to save this $900 of these 6 months with you as well. This is something which you are free to choose. I hope you have understood the financial secure plan now?
7/2/24, 7:12 PM - +263 77 623 2165: Yes Ms Siddhi
8/2/24, 4:21 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Panashe.

I hope you are all doing wonderful today. How has your day been going so far?
8/2/24, 4:21 PM - +263 77 623 2165: It is okay thank you Ms Siddhi
8/2/24, 4:50 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. During our previous session, we had discussed the Financial Secure Plan until the 20th and final month of the plan. Now that you have all the information, I want you to take some time and discuss the financial security plan with your family members. Help them understand its importance and details. Once you're done, we can reconnect, have a discussion, and address any queries you may have. After resolving your concerns, I'll guide you through starting your financial security plan. 

While most people can discuss this with their family the same day, I understand everyone is different. Could you let me know when you think you'll have the discussion with your family? This way, we can schedule our next session accordingly.
8/2/24, 5:17 PM - +263 77 623 2165: Saturday I will discuss the financial plan
8/2/24, 5:35 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That's perfectly fine. In that case, we will conclude today's conversation, and I will connect with you on Saturday to resume our discussion. In the meantime, I hope you'll have a detailed discussion with your family and jot down any questions or thoughts you have regarding the Financial Secure plan.

Wishing you a good day ahead, and please extend our regards to your family.
12/2/24, 4:25 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Panashe

Please, how are you doing today? With regards to our discussion yesterday, I wanted to reach out and enquire if you are available for us to have a brief conversation?

26/2/24, 11:42 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Panashe,

I hope you had a wonderful weekend. Over the weekend, our team engaged in discussions regarding the Meet and Greet Seminar, reflecting on the valuable insights gained from interacting with our students. The experience was truly enriching for us, and we hope it was equally enjoyable for you as well.

Before we proceed with our discussion today, I would like to inquire how you are doing this fine morning?
26/2/24, 12:56 PM - +263 77 623 2165: Am doing okay Ms Siddhi thank you
26/2/24, 1:03 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. It has been a while since we last connected, and our team has had quite hectic past few days. As you already know, over the last weekend, Team Edoofa had been bustling with activity – both in India and Harare for the Meet and Greet '24. Now that things have settled down a bit, I wanted to express my sincere gratitude to you for participating in the event and playing a role in its success. I would like to share a few glimpses of the seminar with you, which demonstrates how enthusiastic and engaged our students were!

26/2/24, 1:03 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Your insights from the event are incredibly valuable, and I'm keen to hear about your experience. Would you be willing to share your thoughts, including your interest in attending similar events in the future and any suggestions for improvement? Moreover, if you've captured any memorable moments in photos, we would greatly appreciate it if you could share them with us.
26/2/24, 1:03 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
26/2/24, 1:05 PM - +263 77 623 2165: Sure thing Ms Siddhi
26/2/24, 1:15 PM - +263 77 623 2165: I remember the videos that I saw about the life experience of students who are currently in India and there were few adjustments that were made for the students to cope with others such as  food , some of them preferred their traditional dishes other than the Indian food. Moreover there was a business seminar I can't vividly remember it though but I think it was something like that when students had an opportunity to carryout their business presentation and to learn about AI ( Artificial intelligence) how it has changed the world. Also the requirements that needed for student to get  a better University and Scholarship credits through attaining 15 points or better and scoring high for the ESAT test. I think that's what I remember Ms Siddhi
26/2/24, 1:17 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your experience with me. I am so pleased to hear that you had a good experience at the seminar, and we look forward to hosting more such events for our Edoofians! 

Also, regarding the discussion we had the other day about the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan, I wanted to follow up on our last conversation. Have you, as a family, been able to discuss it? If so, I would like to understand how the discussion went. What were their thoughts about it? Did they have any specific queries or concerns that you would like us to address?
26/2/24, 1:20 PM - +263 77 623 2165: Yes we did have a discussion and there were pleased to hear about the financial secure plan and how it can reduce financial stress , so their question was when do we start save our financial income.
26/2/24, 1:20 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know, Parents and Panashe. For the current round of students, there are only 10 seats available for the students who can benefit from the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan. 

Since you have been one of the most dedicated students, and I see you have great aspirations, I wanted you to be a part of the same set of students and start with your future planning the right way.
26/2/24, 1:21 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Also, as this plan commences from the month of February, for the efficient implementation of this plan, we need to decide on a fixed date on which you will deposit $150 every month. This will provide you with the flexibility to align your finances accordingly.
26/2/24, 1:21 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Our complete focus is on providing students and parents with the best ways to avail themselves of these opportunities. We understand that every parent may not be able to make the payment on our specified date. Therefore, considering this situation, we allow them to decide the payment date according to their comfort. In light of the same, may I know the fixed date every month on which you will deposit $150?
26/2/24, 1:25 PM - +263 77 623 2165: First of April Ms Siddhi
26/2/24, 1:27 PM - +263 77 623 2165: Sorry I forgot to ask another question there were asking if the money  is going to be deposited into our accounts
26/2/24, 1:29 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: For the first 10 months, you will be required to save with us, and from the 11th month onwards we will guide you towards opening a bank account under Panashe's name in which you will be saving the rest of the amount. I hope that helps?
26/2/24, 1:29 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing these details, your commitment to securing a seat in this exclusive program is appreciated.

To proceed with the next steps, we will be sharing an official agreement detailing the specifics of the Financial Secure Plan along with its benefits. This agreement is a crucial document that outlines the terms and conditions of your participation in the program. It serves as a legal framework ensuring transparency and mutual understanding between all parties involved.

27/2/24, 12:53 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Panashe,

I hope you are doing well today. Kindly excuse me for not being able to respond to your last message as I was not feeling well and had to conclude my day early. However, I am pleased to let you know that I am feeling better today and eager to proceed with our discussion. Before we do so, I would like to ask how your day has been going so far?
27/2/24, 12:59 PM - +263 77 623 2165: It is okay and I thank the Almighty that you are now feeling better Ms Siddhi
27/2/24, 1:04 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for your concern please, I appreciate it. Could you kindly let me know as to why you wish to start from the month of May?
27/2/24, 1:06 PM - +263 77 623 2165: I just realized that April has alot of tight schedules so we had to make a little bit of adjustment
27/2/24, 1:09 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. Originally, the plan is supposed to commence from the month of February, such that we are able to save in a timely manner by the end of November for Panashe's higher education. I would like to provide you with a valuable insight. Panashe's registration fee towards the university scholarship seat will be due in the month of August, which will range from $500 to $1000. The plan has been provided to you to ensure that there are no last minute burdens on you and that you get ample time to save for the same. I hope we are together in this?
27/2/24, 1:10 PM - +263 77 623 2165: Yes Ms Siddhi we are
27/2/24, 1:14 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to know that we are on the same page here. In such a case, I understand that you might have certain constraints in the month of April. May I know if you will be able to adjust the amount for the first 3 months (February, March, April) in your subsequent payments from May to November?
27/2/24, 1:17 PM - +263 77 623 2165: Can you elaborate please
27/2/24, 1:27 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Surely. Would it be possible for you to distribute the missed payments from February to April across the remaining months from May to November? To explain further, the amounts for the first 3 months can be adjusted in your payment in the last 7 months, and you will be required to deposit an amount of $215 from May onwards till end of November. May I know if that is suitable for you?
27/2/24, 1:31 PM - +263 77 623 2165: Let me consult my parent I will get back to you after 30 mins max
27/2/24, 1:39 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Surely. Discussing financial matters with your parents is very important. I will look forward to receiving a response from your end.
27/2/24, 1:46 PM - +263 77 623 2165: Thank you Ms Siddhi
27/2/24, 3:24 PM - +263 77 623 2165: After the discussion I had with my parent she intends to start with the usual fee $150 and she will pay the remaining fee  the month of November
27/2/24, 3:47 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. To clarify, you mean that you wish to deposit $150 from May till October, and you will balance the remaining amount of $600 in the month of November?
27/2/24, 4:35 PM - +263 77 623 2165: Yes Ms Siddhi
