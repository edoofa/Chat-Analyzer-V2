I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them.

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
24/1/24, 9:55 AM - +263 77 820 3688: Let's start
24/1/24, 9:58 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Alright please, I would encourage you to go through the above image representing your university admission process and once you are done, let me know so that I can explain the same to you in detail.
24/1/24, 9:58 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
24/1/24, 10:10 AM - +263 77 820 3688: Am done
24/1/24, 10:12 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
24/1/24, 10:12 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
24/1/24, 10:24 AM - +263 77 820 3688: Yes
24/1/24, 10:25 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps-

27/1/24, 10:14 AM - +263 77 820 3688: Question  2 

How do you see you country's development and how can you contribute to it through the career you want to build 

Allow me to start by defining key point , development it is a direct change then career  we can say one's profession 

 Our country has faced many challenges, including political instability, economic challenges, and the legacy of colonialism. People believe that economic development is the key to improving the lives of Zimbabweans.  l see the career of political science as one way to support this development. For example, l can work in the government, in the private sector, or in NGOs. I can use my skills am to obtain through choosing political science to analyze data, develop policies, and advocate for people 
One way that l can contribute to Zimbabwe's development is by working on electoral reform. Our country has a history of disputed elections, and  people believe that electoral reform is necessary to ensure free and fair elections. People like me whom may have studied political science in  can help to design new voting systems, train election workers, and monitor elections. We can also help to promote transparency and accountability in the electoral process. This work can help to ensure that the voices of all Zimbabweans are heard and that they have a say in their own future.
27/1/24, 10:14 AM - +263 77 820 3688: <Media omitted>
27/1/24, 10:59 AM - +263 77 820 3688: The four major fields of political science are:

1. American government and politics
2. Comparative politics
3. International relations
4. Political theory.
American government and potential ,field studies the U.S. Constitution, the three branches of government, and how they work together.lt also studies the role of political parties, interest groups, and the media in shaping public policy.lt also studies the history of the American political system and how it has evolved over time
 Comparative politics, this field studies the similarities and differences between different political systems around the world.lt looks at the historical, cultural, and economic factors that influence the development of different systems.It also looks at how countries deal with issues like human rights, corruption, and economic development
 International relations ,this field studies the interactions between countries and how they cooperate and compete. It looks at issues like war and peace, trade and globalization, and the environment.It also studies the role of international organizations, such as the United Nations and the World Trade Organization. 
Political theory,this field looks at the ideas and concepts that shape political systems.It looks at the nature of power, justice, liberty, and equality.It also looks at the different schools of thought in political theory, such as liberalism, conservatism, and socialism.
27/1/24, 11:08 AM - +263 77 820 3688: Question 4 :What is the difference between parliamentary democracy and the presidential democracy 

ln a parliamentary democracy, the government is formed by the party or coalition of parties that has the most seats in the legislature. The head of government, often called the prime minister, is chosen by the legislature. In a presidential democracy, on the other hand, the head of government, usually called the president, is directly elected by the people. In a presidential democracy, the president is usually given more powers than the prime minister in a parliamentary democracy. 
In a parliamentary democracy, the government is more stable because it's easier to pass laws and make changes. But in a presidential democracy, the president has more power to veto laws and make changes on their own. Another difference is that in a parliamentary democracy, the government is more accountable to the people because the prime minister can be removed by a vote of no confidence. In a presidential democracy, the president is more insulated from public opinion because they're not directly accountable to the people.
27/1/24, 11:20 AM - +263 77 820 3688: Question 5 : Please explain egalitarianism. 

Egalitarianism a political theory that focuses on equality and fairness. It's based on the idea that all people are equal and should be treated as such. Egalitarianism can be applied to many different areas, including economics, education, and law. Some common goals of egalitarianism are to reduce poverty, eliminate discrimination, and promote equal opportunities for everyone. Some people argue that egalitarianism is the best way to achieve justice in society. 
One of the main criticisms of egalitarianism is that it's not always possible to achieve perfect equality in the real world. For example, some people have more natural talents or abilities than others, which can make it hard to achieve true equality. Another criticism is that egalitarianism can lead to a nanny state, where the government tries to control too many aspects of people's lives. However, many supporters of egalitarianism argue that these criticisms are not valid, and that the benefits of egalitarianism outweigh the costs. 
Another aspect of egalitarianism is its relationship to liberty. Some  argue that a truly egalitarian society would have to restrict individual liberty in order to achieve equality.  People might have to give up some of their wealth or status in order to ensure that everyone is equal.

As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
27/1/24, 2:11 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
27/1/24, 2:11 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
27/1/24, 2:11 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
27/1/24, 2:11 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
27/1/24, 2:14 PM - +263 77 820 3688: Sure
27/1/24, 2:17 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
27/1/24, 2:17 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $1000. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalise their registration process.
27/1/24, 2:17 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counsellor has also discussed the registration fee during your counselling sessions, correct?
27/1/24, 2:27 PM - +263 77 820 3688: Noted
27/1/24, 2:35 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $1200 to $1800 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
27/1/24, 2:36 PM - +263 77 820 3688: Yes am following
27/1/24, 2:57 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:
27/1/24, 2:57 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 1. *Tuition Fee*: $650 per annum
2. *Accommodation Fee*: $0 per annum (100% Sponsorship)
3. *Remaining Fee Components*: [Library Fee, Examination Fee, EDB and Book Bank, International Student Development Fund, 24-Hour WiFi Cost, Maintenance Fee, Water Bill, and Electricity Bill]: $1000 per annum

*Total Fee: Tuition Fee $650 + Accommodation Fee $0 + Remaining Fee Components $1000 = $1650 per annum.*
27/1/24, 2:58 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Registration Fee to be paid: $1000 (deadline within two weeks of issue of the offer letter, part of the university’s first-year fee and will be adjusted against the first-year cost of education $1650). I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?
27/1/24, 3:17 PM - +263 77 820 3688: Thank you very much
27/1/24, 3:37 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $1000, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $1000 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $1650 as per the above example.
27/1/24, 3:37 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $1650 - $1000 = $650. This amount can be paid in two instalments of $325 each. The initial instalment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $325 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly instalments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
27/1/24, 3:57 PM - +263 77 820 3688: Oky thank you
27/1/24, 4:01 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
27/1/24, 4:02 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
27/1/24, 4:02 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
27/1/24, 4:16 PM - +263 77 266 4290: Noted with thanks
27/1/24, 4:35 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.
27/1/24, 4:35 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
27/1/24, 5:27 PM - +263 77 266 4290: Thank you so much for asking such a good  question.yes lam willing for my girl's further education my question is  lam budging to you to make any payment plain.lam happy to hear on your side thank you in advance.
27/1/24, 5:30 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand ma'am. We do have a payment plan in place for you, however since my operational hours have already concluded for the day and I have had a long day already, could you kindly suggest a suitable time for you on Monday between 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM when we can discuss the same?
27/1/24, 5:32 PM - +263 77 266 4290: Thank you so much for such a kind.lets discuss on Monday same time 9.00am-10-00am
27/1/24, 5:43 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. In such a case, we will conclude today's conversation and reconnect on Monday at 9:00 AM. Until then, please take care and kindly extend my regards to your family as well.
29/1/24, 9:25 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Lisah. I hope you are all doing well. May I know how you are doing today?
29/1/24, 9:25 AM - +263 77 266 4290: Morning and how are you
29/1/24, 9:27 AM - +263 77 266 4290: Iam fine
29/1/24, 9:30 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to know that Lisah. I am doing well too, thank you for asking.
29/1/24, 9:30 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now with our previous conversation, we are done with step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
29/1/24, 9:31 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one.
29/1/24, 9:31 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
29/1/24, 9:31 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/1/24, 9:47 AM - +263 77 266 4290: Thank you this is wonderful.
29/1/24, 9:48 AM - +263 77 266 4290: Iam the mother.we have discussed about payment plan.
29/1/24, 9:52 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
29/1/24, 9:52 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavour for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received special news for the students of the 2024 admission intake. May I know if you are excited to know the news we have for you?
29/1/24, 9:57 AM - +263 77 266 4290: Yes
29/1/24, 10:39 AM - +263 77 820 3688: Yes
29/1/24, 10:43 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am happy to see that you are excited. After speaking with thousands of students and parents who completed their admission process before you, we realised that the current economic situation in African countries makes it a bit challenging for parents to pay the full registration fee at once. 

In response to the same challenge, we had a detailed discussion with the academic board and university official. As a result, we developed a solution to alleviate the financial burden of the parents specifically for the registration fee due of $500 to $1000.
29/1/24, 10:43 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: We at Edoofa are thrilled about this development, and I believe it will significantly help all of our students and their families. Are you aware of the solution?
29/1/24, 10:47 AM - +263 77 266 4290: Yes lam aware the problem is that we are not afford to pay the fee of 1000us at once.we are come from a poor family but we want our child to go further this why we chose Edoofa.
29/1/24, 10:48 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Let me share a solution for the same. With respect to the conversation we had with the academic board and the university officials, we requested them to allow the students to make the payment of their registration fee in two parts within a span of 45 days thereby reducing the financial pressure. <This message was edited>
29/1/24, 10:48 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Here's how it works: Consider that your registration fee is $1000. After you will receive the offer letter, the first part of the registration fees which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, i.e. $500 needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university (For most of the universities 15 days). Subsequently, the second part of $500, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
29/1/24, 10:48 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for January 29, 2024, and your registration fee stands at $1000, you'll need to make a payment of $500 on or before January 25, 2024. The remaining $500 should be paid by February 29 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
29/1/24, 10:50 AM - +263 77 266 4290: Ok lam getting it now so our 1000 we have to pay it twice 500 first and another500 again.thank so much if it is like that.
29/1/24, 10:55 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is correct ma'am. Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
29/1/24, 10:56 AM - +263 77 266 4290: No further question for now
29/1/24, 10:57 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: With this, we can proceed to step 4 of the admission cycle, i.e., Offer Letter from University/College. Are you excited to initiate the process? For the current round of admissions, only 31 scholarship seats are available and hence let us begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the payment plan offered for the registration fee. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
29/1/24, 11:01 AM - +263 77 266 4290: Very excited madam
29/1/24, 11:04 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am happy to hear that, ma'am. With this, we can proceed to step 4 of the admission cycle, i.e., Offer Letter from University/College. The universities will take three to five days to evaluate your application, after which, if they accept your application for a scholarship, they will send you a scholarship offer letter. In the offer letter, the scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee will be mentioned.

On this note, let us conclude our conversation for today. I had a very good time interacting with you. I will reach out to you once we get an update from the universities. Wish you a blessed day ahead, and please extend our regards to your family as well.
29/1/24, 11:06 AM - +263 77 266 4290: Thank you so much
