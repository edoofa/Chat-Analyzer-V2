21/12/23, 12:39 PM - You joined using this group's invite link
21/12/23, 6:03 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening, dear parents and Vimbainashe!

I hope this message finds you well and blessed. May I know if you are currently available so that we can proceed with the session for your admission process?
21/12/23, 6:16 PM - +263 78 126 2807: Good afternoon 
I am available but my parents aren't available
21/12/23, 7:00 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is alright, they can catch up to us anytime. Thank you for sharing your understanding. I did go through your responses and I can see you did understand all the videos. 

*Video 1: Important Message for Enrolled Students*

The first video underscores the importance of two crucial qualities: open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions. Edoofa's vision for its students is to foster success in their careers, and promote responsibility, and independence. A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.
21/12/23, 7:01 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s Vision for You*

Edoofa's vision for its students is to provide them with employment opportunities and the skills necessary to become future leaders. The program places students above other candidates by investing significant time and effort into finding reputable, education-focused institutions rather than solely business-oriented ones.
21/12/23, 7:01 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

In the third video, it is highlighted that Edoofa's founders have dedicated over a decade to meticulously identifying reputable educational institutions. Students are advised to cultivate the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to excel in the job market. All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to student's career goals.
21/12/23, 7:01 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools. It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.
21/12/23, 7:01 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: In summary, these videos emphasize the significance of qualities such as open-mindedness, following instructions, and cooperation. Edoofa's vision is to empower students for successful careers and leadership roles by carefully selecting educational institutions. The SOP is a vital tool for effective communication and admission success. 

I hope you agree with all of this and were able to understand these by watching the four videos?
21/12/23, 7:03 PM - +263 78 126 2807: I agree and understand well
21/12/23, 7:19 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Brilliant, Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.
21/12/23, 7:19 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by Tomorrow 6:30 PM.
21/12/23, 7:19 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

21/12/23, 7:19 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: 2. I am sharing two documents with you. Kindly go through both documents and submit your responses to the course document here in the group. Make sure you research well before starting the task. All the best!
21/12/23, 7:20 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
21/12/23, 7:20 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
21/12/23, 7:28 PM - +263 78 126 2807: I will do my best thank you
21/12/23, 8:07 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: You are most welcome.
28/12/23, 6:02 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon!

As it has been a while. May I know how are you doing today?
28/12/23, 6:03 PM - +263 78 126 2807: We are fine, thank you.
28/12/23, 6:03 PM - +263 78 126 2807: How are you ?
28/12/23, 7:25 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am great, thank you for asking. May I know if you were able to go through the above points?
28/12/23, 7:45 PM - +263 78 126 2807: I went through the points
28/12/23, 8:18 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through the above points, do you want me to help you understand how the Edoofa Secure Plan works?
29/12/23, 2:59 PM - +263 78 126 2807: Yes please
29/12/23, 6:14 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening!

I hope you are doing well today. May I know if you are currently available to proceed with the session for the admission process?
29/12/23, 7:21 PM - +263 78 126 2807: Good evening to you 
I am available
29/12/23, 7:31 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. May I know if you were able to go through these above points?
29/12/23, 7:33 PM - +263 78 126 2807: Yes I went through them
29/12/23, 7:36 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through the above points, do you want me to help you understand how the Edoofa Secure Plan works?
29/12/23, 7:37 PM - +263 78 126 2807: Yes please
29/12/23, 8:00 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, as you are aware, we are currently in December 2023, and we have a good 20-21 months to plan for your finances before you start your university education in 2025.
29/12/23, 8:00 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: During the counseling session, you were informed that at Edoofa, we guarantee a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship on the tuition fees. Hence, the cost of education, including food and accommodation after the scholarship, would be between $2000-$3000, and it could be even less. Not more than that.
29/12/23, 8:00 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: This means that if you can save $150 per month for the next 20 months, you will be able to save $3000. This amount is more than enough for the first year of university fees, including tuition fees (if any), food, and accommodation. I hope you agree with this?
29/12/23, 8:24 PM - +263 78 126 2807: I agree with that
29/12/23, 8:25 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Right, this means that by the time you would be in India, you would have already saved the $3000 that will cover the first-year fee.
29/12/23, 8:25 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, in these next 20 months, I am sure you would also be engaged in the EWYL program, and if you secure a minimum of $1000 in 20 months, that means the fees for 1.5 years are already secured.
29/12/23, 8:25 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, for a 3-year course, if we follow the same approach for the remaining 1.5 years, the educational journey for the student and the financial journey for the parent will be easy and smooth. I believe you must be able to see this perspective?
29/12/23, 8:26 PM - +263 78 126 2807: Yes i understand
29/12/23, 9:16 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/12/23, 9:18 PM - +263 78 126 2807: Thank you so much for the time and effort you put in helping me .
I wish you a Happy New Year
2/1/24, 6:36 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Eevning dear parent and my dear student!

I hope you had your wonderful holidays with your loved ones. As we embark on a furitful fresh new year. May I know if you are now reay to proceed with the session for the admisison process for today?
3/1/24, 5:39 PM - +263 78 126 2807: Good evening I am ready <This message was edited>
3/1/24, 5:53 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening!

I hope you are doing well and blessed. I was not available by the time you connected as it was past my available hours. May I know if you are currently available to proceed with the session?
3/1/24, 5:55 PM - +263 78 126 2807: I will be available at 7pm
3/1/24, 5:58 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know.
3/1/24, 7:07 PM - +263 78 126 2807: Good evening I am now available
3/1/24, 7:26 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. With that said, there is also another benefit, I am sure being in Zimbabwe you know how drastically the exchange rate fluctuates.
3/1/24, 7:26 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: If you are buying a dollar today, you might be spending 7000 bonds, but if you buy a dollar after a month, the rate would be different.
3/1/24, 7:26 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Also, even if you choose to buy dollars every month and save at your home, it is not safe since there is news of robbery, and mugging every day.
3/1/24, 7:26 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: In that case, you will opt to save in the Bank, but again we know that savings in the Bank require a Nostro Account which means you have to pay the bank to keep your money safe, right?
3/1/24, 7:28 PM - +263 78 126 2807: Yes I agree
3/1/24, 7:35 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is great to hear, considering these constraints, Edoofa Management has decided to help the parents and students prepare for the journey way ahead of time by helping them save money with Edoofa without any addional charges but rather saving additional money as well. Do you want me to explain how this has been achieved?
3/1/24, 7:36 PM - +263 78 126 2807: Yes please explain
3/1/24, 7:59 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Under the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan, a parent has to deposit a small amount of money which is $150 every month for the next 10 months. That means, in 10 months, the money saved will be $1500.
3/1/24, 7:59 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Imagine you paying $15 every month to the Bank of Zimbabwe to keep your money safe, and here Edoofa is paying you $15 every month to keep your money safe. Now, you must be wondering, why only for 10 months and not for 20 months, right?
3/1/24, 8:01 PM - +263 78 126 2807: Yes why?
3/1/24, 8:02 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: If you see the bigger picture, you will realize that the reason is quite simple. Upon the completion of the 10 installments, the Edoofa Admissions team will initiate the Child’s Admission Process by applying early to the universities to secure their scholarship and their university seat.
3/1/24, 8:02 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Reserving seats earlier increases the chances of obtaining a maximum scholarship. A higher scholarship means lower fees, and by securing the seat, you will be entitled to pay the fees as per the old fee structure of the university, not the new one implemented in January 2025. Furthermore, when applying to the universities, you will receive an offer letter or a letter of intent detailing the fees, scholarship, and registration fee.
3/1/24, 8:02 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: As explained during the enrollment process, the registration fee is a portion of your first-year university fee, paid to reserve the seat. It ranges from $500-$1000 and is not an additional fee. 

From the $1500 you saved with Edoofa, the registration fee will be paid to the university, securing the seat. For instance, if the registration fee is $1000, Edoofa will pay $1000 from the $1500 saved in 10 months. The updated balance with Edoofa will be $500, which will be paid to the university upon your arrival in India.
3/1/24, 8:02 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: This eases the financial burden on the parent, as there is no immediate payment required upon the student's arrival. The $500 saved will cover the remaining fees for the semester/year, as specified in the offer letter from the university. What are your thoughts on this?
3/1/24, 8:07 PM - +263 78 126 2807: I think it is great and very helpful
3/1/24, 9:13 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to see that we are together so far. With this plan for the next 10 months, I am sure you must be wondering what will happen in the next 10 months, considering you have already secured your scholarship seat with the university due to your hard work in the first 10 months. Is my understanding correct?
4/1/24, 12:03 PM - +263 78 126 2807: Yes it's correct
4/1/24, 6:46 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening!

I hope you are doing well and blessed. I was not available by the time you connected as it was past my available hours. May I know if you are currently available to proceed with the session?
4/1/24, 7:00 PM - +263 78 126 2807: Good evening I am available
4/1/24, 7:16 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let me help you with that as well. In the 11th month, you will be guided to open an FBC Mastercard bank account in Zimbabwe with a deposit of $150. The reason for this is that when you apply for your student Visa, the Embassy asks for a Bank Statement, and this account will serve that purpose.
4/1/24, 7:16 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: We understand it might be expensive if you deposit another $1500 for the remaining 10 months in FB  Bank Zimbabwe, so to avoid the same challenges, we have designed the plan accordingly. You will only be depositing for the 11th, 12th, 13th, and 14th month, which is 4 months.
4/1/24, 7:16 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once the 4 months are completed, our Department of Student Welfare (DSW) team will assist you with your visa process. The bank statement will act as one of the required documents, and once you receive the visa, you can withdraw the amount from FBC and book the flight ticket. This will help you utilize the money as well. How does it sound?
4/1/24, 7:26 PM - +263 78 126 2807: It sounds great
4/1/24, 9:02 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, from the 16th Month till the 20th month, considering it is a 6-month window, you can again continue depositing the money ($150) with Edoofa which can be used in the fee as and when required or you can decide to save this $900 of these 6 months with you as well. This is something which you are free to choose. I hope you have understood the financial secure plan now?
5/1/24, 7:58 PM - +263 78 126 2807: I have understood
5/1/24, 8:06 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: That's great. Now that you have all the information, I want you to take some time and discuss the financial security plan with your family members. Help them understand its importance and details. Once you're done, we can reconnect, have a discussion, and address any queries you may have. After resolving your concerns, I'll guide you through starting your financial security plan. 

While most students can discuss this with their parents the same day, I understand everyone is different. Could you let me know by when you think you'll have the discussion with your parents? This way, we can schedule our next session accordingly.
5/1/24, 8:07 PM - +263 78 126 2807: I understand
5/1/24, 8:12 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: That's perfectly fine. In that case, we will conclude today's conversation, and I will connect with you on tomorrow to resume our discussion. In the meantime, I hope you'll have a detailed discussion with your family and jot down any questions or thoughts you have regarding the Financial Secure plan.

Wishing you a good day ahead, and please extend our regards to your family.
5/1/24, 8:13 PM - +263 78 126 2807: Thank you 
I surely will
6/1/24, 11:56 AM - Shivjeet Edoofa added Dev Edoofa
6/1/24, 12:10 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, Parents of Vimbainashe,

I firmly believe that with the commencement of this new year, comes the promise of fresh beginnings, guiding the way for the actualization of one's deepest dreams and aspirations. As we stand on the threshold of this promising year, I am filled with excitement for the adventures it holds.
6/1/24, 12:10 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: In the same spirit, I would like to share that I am embarking on a journey as I prepare myself to pursue my doctorate and take a step forward in my academic pursuits. This transition marks a significant chapter in my life as I will be bidding farewell to the cherished moments at the Admissions Team in Edoofa.

Over the past year, having the privilege of supporting numerous students, including you, in your pursuit of higher education has been truly rewarding. Witnessing our students thrive and excel in their dream universities and colleges has brought immense satisfaction.

9/1/24, 9:18 PM - Dev Edoofa: In the past few days, I had an in-depth discussion with Mr. Shivjeet and had the opportunity to review your scholarship application file in our records. Through this process, I gained valuable insights into your dreams and aspirations to advance your academic career. Upon reviewing your application file, I was both impressed and reassured to assist you in achieving these goals here in India, which will unlock doors to incredible opportunities in the future.
9/1/24, 9:18 PM - Dev Edoofa: Before we get into the specifics of your admission journey and talk about your admission process, I would like to share an exciting milestone that India as a country achieved within the first week of 2024 – the successful India's Chandrayaan-3 Engine Test. This accomplishment is responsible for the third lunar mission, aiming to land a rover on the Moon's south polar region and conduct scientific studies that could check Moon's viability to sustain life. It signifies a significant scientific advancement, laying the groundwork for future progress.
9/1/24, 9:18 PM - Dev Edoofa: This achievement has not only pushed boundaries but also inspired young minds all over the world to pursue their dreams. On the same note, I wanted to extend my heartiest wishes for the New Year to you and your family and check in to see how you and your family started your year?
10/1/24, 8:02 PM - +263 78 126 2807: Thank you we have started it pretty great
12/1/24, 9:07 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to know that you had a great start to the year and I hope you are excited for the new day and most importantly the new year as well. @263781262807 , the new year brings about a transformative mindset in us which may not emphasize immediate changes but a change in the direction that you believe is needed.

If I talk about myself, I have made a resolution to bring more humility in myself and bring about a change in my perspective to be a better version of myself all while ensuring that I help all of our students to achieve their educational goals. With that said, I would like to know what aspirations or a change in your approach towards life you wish to achieve? <This message was edited>

26/1/24, 9:30 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Vimbainashe,

I am *Ms. Siddhi Singh, Admission Officer at Edoofa*. Recently I was having a discussion with the Academic Board.

Before reaching out to you today, I was going through pictures and videos from Edoofa's very first SLICE CON held last week, and that sparked my curiosity about whether you are familiar with what SLICE CON is or not?
29/1/24, 3:02 PM - +263 78 126 2807: No I'm not familiar with it
29/1/24, 3:37 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is alright, Let me tell you a bit about the same.  Recently, Edoofa hosted a conference called the Symposium of Leaders, Innovators, and Creators at Edoofa, also known as 'SLICE-CON.'

Since you have been one of the most dedicated students, and I see you have great aspirations, I wanted you to be a part of the same set of students and start with your future planning the right way.
30/1/24, 12:31 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Also, as this plan commences from the month of January, for the efficient implementation of this plan, we need to decide on a fixed date on which you will deposit $150 every month. This will provide you with the flexibility to align your finances accordingly.
30/1/24, 12:31 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Our complete focus is on providing students and parents with the best ways to avail themselves of these opportunities. We understand that every parent may not be able to make the payment on our specified date. Therefore, considering this situation, we allow them to decide the payment date according to their comfort. In light of the same, may I know the fixed date every month on which you will deposit $150?
30/1/24, 12:34 PM - +263 78 126 2807: Good afternoon to you, too

30/1/24, 1:27 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that. Could you kindly let me know by when you will be able to share the information with me Vimbainashe?

I assure you that by the 25th of February we would have deposited the money. sorry that we did not communicate on time
30/1/24, 1:52 PM - +263 77 366 3874: We are still dedicated to fulfilling our daughter's dream through the Edoofa program
30/1/24, 2:15 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: It is alright please. Thank you for sharing the same with me. In such a case, since every month is supposed to have the same deposit date, are you comfortable with making the 25th of the next 10 months as your deposit date?

I hope that you are all doing wonderful today. How has your day been going so far?
6/2/24, 11:59 AM - +263 77 366 3874: good afternoon Ms. Siddhi. I went through the financial agreement. i understood most of the points outlined except for the Waiver issue. May you please explain a little more
6/2/24, 12:16 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. By being a part of the Financial Secure Plan, you will receive a $150 waiver, provided all the conditions in the agreement have been met. If you have already completed the payment of $350 towards the Edoofa Enrolment fee, the amount of $150 that you paid for the Edoofa Enrolment fee will be adjusted towards your university fee and hence can act as a part of your 10th installment. If you are yet to pay the remaining $150 towards the Enrollment Fee, it will be waived off and you can continue with the Financial Secure Plan as discussed. I hope this helps with your query?
6/2/24, 12:17 PM - +263 77 366 3874: okay
6/2/24, 12:20 PM - +263 77 366 3874: Can we still pay the $150 installments through your Zimbabwe representative Mr Jerera as we did with the registration fee
6/2/24, 3:30 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Yes. You can most definitely pay your monthly installments via Mr. Charles Jerera. We will also provide you with alternatives, and you can choose whichever method is most convenient for you. I hope this helps with your query?
6/2/24, 3:33 PM - +263 77 366 3874: very helpful, thank you. So we will be waiting for the other alternatives or we will just pay through Mr Charles
7/2/24, 11:23 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Vimbainashe
