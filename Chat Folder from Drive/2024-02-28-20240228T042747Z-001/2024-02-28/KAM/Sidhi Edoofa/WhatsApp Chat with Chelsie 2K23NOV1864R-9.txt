20/12/23, 7:00 PM - +263 71 249 4868: We are all fine and you.

20/12/23, 7:21 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. I did go through your responses and I can see you did understand all the videos. 

*Video 1: Important Message for Enrolled Students*

The first video underscores the importance of two crucial qualities: open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions. Edoofa's vision for its students is to foster success in their careers, and promote responsibility, and independence. A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.
20/12/23, 7:21 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s Vision for You*

Edoofa's vision for its students is to provide them with employment opportunities and the skills necessary to become future leaders. The program places students above other candidates by investing significant time and effort into finding reputable, education-focused institutions rather than solely business-oriented ones.
20/12/23, 7:21 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

In the third video, it is highlighted that Edoofa's founders have dedicated over a decade to meticulously identifying reputable educational institutions. Students are advised to cultivate the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to excel in the job market. All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to student's career goals.
20/12/23, 7:21 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools. It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.
20/12/23, 7:21 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: In summary, these videos emphasize the significance of qualities such as open-mindedness, following instructions, and cooperation. Edoofa's vision is to empower students for successful careers and leadership roles by carefully selecting educational institutions. The SOP is a vital tool for effective communication and admission success. 

I hope you agree with all of this and were able to understand these by watching the four videos?
20/12/23, 7:47 PM - +263 71 249 4868: Yes I agree with this and thank you for shedding more light on the videos I now understand more.
20/12/23, 8:04 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Brilliant, Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.
20/12/23, 8:04 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by Tomorrow 6:30 PM.
20/12/23, 8:05 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

Sure. Yes I'm ready we may proceed
27/12/23, 8:28 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Edoofa Secure Plan is important for parents who have children joining the university for tertiary education in the next one to two years for several reasons:

*Financial Preparedness:* The Edoofa Secure plan helps parents prepare financially for the costs after the Scholarship being offered so that they are not caught off guard.

*Reduced Financial Stress:* Having the Edoofa Secure Plan in place can significantly reduce the financial stress on you as parents when your child is about to enter university. Knowing that there is a dedicated fund for education expenses provides peace of mind.

*Avoiding Debt*: Without proper savings, some parents may resort to taking out loans or accumulating credit card debt to cover their child's education costs. This Educational savings plan helps avoid the burden of debt and high-interest payments.

*Compound Interest:* By starting to save early and consistently contributing to the savings plan, parents can take advantage of compound interest, which can significantly increase the amount available for education expenses.

*Flexibility and Control:* The Edoofa Secure savings plans allow parents to have greater control over their finances and how they allocate funds for their child's education. They can choose investment options that align with their risk tolerance and financial goals.
27/12/23, 8:28 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Encouraging Responsibility*: Involving your child in the process of saving for their education teaches them financial responsibility and the value of higher education. It also motivates them to outperform in Academics.

*Adapting to Unexpected Changes*: Life is full of surprises, and circumstances can change especially when there are political reforms changing each day impacting the Local Currency. Having an Edoofa Secure Plan allows parents to adapt to unexpected changes in their financial situation while still prioritizing their child's education.

*Peace of Mind:* Overall, having the Edoofa Secure plan provides parents with peace of mind, knowing that they are actively planning for their child's future and increasing the likelihood of providing them with a solid education.
27/12/23, 8:29 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, when you go through all the above benefits, I am sure you can see that the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan is an important financial tool for parents/students who are supposed to enter the university soon. 

It helps ensure that the financial aspect of tertiary education is well-managed, reduces stress, and allows parents to provide the best opportunities for their children without resorting to debt or financial hardship. Isn't this something you and your family also wish to have?
27/12/23, 8:33 PM - +263 71 249 4868: Surely I can see that Edoofa Financial Secure Plan is an important financial tool so as a family this is something we wish to have
27/12/23, 8:39 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through the above points, do you want me to help you understand how the Edoofa Secure Plan works?
27/12/23, 8:44 PM - +263 71 249 4868: Yes you may shed more light so I can understand better.
27/12/23, 8:56 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, as you are aware, we are currently in December 2023, and we have a good 20-21 months to plan for your finances before you start your university education in 2025.
27/12/23, 8:56 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: During the counseling session, you were informed that at Edoofa, we guarantee a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship on the tuition fees. Hence, the cost of education, including food and accommodation after the scholarship, would be between $1200-$1800, and it could be even less. Not more than that.
27/12/23, 8:59 PM - +263 71 249 4868: A 100% scholarship is given to a student who pass with how many points

9/1/24, 9:17 PM - Dev Edoofa: Before we get into the specifics of your admission journey and talk about your admission process, I would like to share an exciting milestone that India as a country achieved within the first week of 2024 – the successful India's Chandrayaan-3 Engine Test.

2/2/24, 5:57 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. I am fine too, thank you for asking. I was going through Chelsie's application profile and It is my understanding that you were being introduced to the Financial Secure Plan. Am I correct? <This message was edited>
2/2/24, 6:46 PM - +263 77 289 2997: Yes I was introduced
2/2/24, 8:15 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. Let us reconnect tomorrow during the day to discuss your thoughts about the same. I wish you a blessed night and kindly extend my regards to your family as well!
2/2/24, 8:27 PM - +263 77 289 2997: It's OK. Same to you. Thank you
3/2/24, 11:43 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Chelsie. How are you all doing this fine morning?
3/2/24, 11:45 AM - +263 77 289 2997: I'm fine. Chelsie is at school. How are you this morning
3/2/24, 11:56 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. I am fine too, thank you for asking. I was going through Chelsie's application profile, and it is my understanding that you were being introduced to the Financial Secure Plan. May I know if I am correct?
3/2/24, 11:57 AM - +263 77 289 2997: Yes you are correct
3/2/24, 11:57 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for confirming that for me. May I know if you have any queries or thoughts regarding the same so far?
3/2/24, 11:58 AM - +263 77 289 2997: I have no queries.
3/2/24, 12:21 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. In such a case, allow me to reiterate some important factors about the Financial Secure Plan for your reference.
3/2/24, 12:24 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 20-30% of the students who are admitted into universities abroad are unable to fulfill their dream and come to India due to lack of financial planning. The Edoofa Financial Secure Plan has been carefully designed by the Edoofa Management, to assist both parents and students and help you prepare for your higher educational finances without experiences stress or last-minute rushes.
3/2/24, 12:25 PM - +263 77 289 2997: Yes you can reiterate the important factors
3/2/24, 12:26 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: The Financial Secure Plan is important for several reasons, like - financial preparedness, reduced financial stress, avoiding debt, compound interest advantage, flexibility and control, encouraging responsibility, adapting to unexpected changes and lastly peace of mind. 

It helps ensure that the financial aspect of tertiary education is well-managed, reduces stress, and allows parents to provide the best opportunities for their children without resorting to debt or financial hardship. Isn't this something you and your family also wish to have?
3/2/24, 12:34 PM - +263 77 289 2997: Yes  I see the financial secure plan is important
3/2/24, 12:59 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, as you are aware, we are currently in February 2024, and we have a good 20 months to plan for your finances before you start your university education in 2025.
3/2/24, 12:59 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: During the counseling session, you were informed that at Edoofa, we guarantee a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship on the tuition fees. Hence, the cost of education, including food and accommodation after the scholarship, would be between $2000-$3000, and it could be even less. Not more than that.
3/2/24, 12:59 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This means that if you can save $150 per month for the next 20 months, you will be able to save $3000. This amount is more than enough for the first year of university fees, including tuition fees (if any), food, and accommodation. I hope you agree with this?
3/2/24, 1:05 PM - +263 77 289 2997: This message was deleted
3/2/24, 1:05 PM - +263 77 289 2997: Yes l agree
3/2/24, 1:14 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Right, this means that by the time you would be in India, you would have already saved the $3000 that will cover the first-year fee.
3/2/24, 1:14 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, in these next 20 months, I am sure you would also be engaged in the EWYL program, and if you secure a minimum of $1000 in 20 months, that means the fees for 1.5 years are already secured.
3/2/24, 1:14 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, for a 3-year course, if we follow the same approach for the remaining 1.5 years, the educational journey for the student and the financial journey for the parent will be easy and smooth. I believe you must be able to see this perspective?
3/2/24, 1:25 PM - +263 77 289 2997: Yes I see this perspective.
3/2/24, 1:30 PM - +263 77 289 2997: Starting saving now its a wise move.
3/2/24, 1:37 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. I would love to continue with our discussion, however my operating hours on Saturdays end at 1:00 PM. Hence, let us conclude our conversation for today and we will reconnect on Monday for our next session.

I wish you and your family a blessed weekend ahead!
3/2/24, 1:38 PM - +263 77 289 2997: Thank you. Have a nice weekend too.
5/2/24, 1:26 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Chelsie.

I hope you all had a great weekend. How is everything on your end today?
5/2/24, 2:22 PM - +263 77 289 2997: I'm fine. How are you
5/2/24, 2:28 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. I am well too, thank you for asking. Allow me to continue with our discussion regarding the Financial Secure Plan. There is also another benefit, I am sure being in Zimbabwe you know how drastically the exchange rate fluctuates.
5/2/24, 2:28 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: If you are buying a dollar today, you might be spending 7000 bonds, but if you buy a dollar after a month, the rate would be different.
5/2/24, 2:28 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Also, even if you choose to buy dollars every month and save at your home, it is not safe since there is news of robbery, and mugging every day.
5/2/24, 2:28 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: In that case, you will opt to save in the Bank, but again we know that savings in the Bank require a Nostro Account which means you have to pay the bank to keep your money safe, right?
5/2/24, 2:29 PM - +263 77 289 2997: Yes that's true.
5/2/24, 2:33 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is great to hear. Considering these constraints, Edoofa Management has decided to help the parents and students prepare for the journey way ahead of time by helping them save money with Edoofa without any additional charges but rather saving additional money as well. Do you want me to explain how this has been achieved?
5/2/24, 2:35 PM - +263 77 289 2997: You can explain
5/2/24, 2:48 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Program Fee (Enrollment Fee) that you were asked to pay is $350. Under the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan, a parent has to deposit a small amount of money which is $150 every month for the next 10 months. That means, in 10 months, the money saved will be $1500.
5/2/24, 2:48 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That means, in 10 months, the money saved will be $1500. When this money is saved, Edoofa will waive off $150 from the Edoofa Program/Enrollment Fee of $350, thereby making a straight saving of $150 in 10 months.
5/2/24, 2:48 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Imagine you paying $15 every month to the Bank of Zimbabwe to keep your money safe, and here Edoofa is paying you $15 every month to keep your money safe. Now, you must be wondering, why only for 10 months and not for 20 months, right?
5/2/24, 2:50 PM - +263 77 289 2997: I already paid the enrolment fee of $350
5/2/24, 3:06 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: By being a part of the Financial Secure Plan, you will receive a $150 waiver on your last installment to be paid, provided all the conditions in the agreement have been met. The amount of $150 that you paid for the Edoofa Enrolment fee will be adjusted towards your university fee and hence can act as a part of your 10th installment. I hope this helps with your query?
5/2/24, 3:08 PM - +263 77 289 2997: OK. I understand.
5/2/24, 3:21 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: If you see the bigger picture, you will realize that the reason is quite simple. Upon the completion of the 10 installments, the Edoofa Admissions team will initiate the Child’s Admission Process by applying early to the universities to secure their scholarship and their university seat.
5/2/24, 3:21 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Reserving seats earlier increases the chances of obtaining a maximum scholarship. A higher scholarship means lower fees, and by securing the seat, you will be entitled to pay the fees as per the old fee structure of the university, not the new one implemented in January 2025. Furthermore, when applying to the universities, you will receive an offer letter or a letter of intent detailing the fees, scholarship, and registration fees.
5/2/24, 3:21 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: As explained during the enrollment process, the registration fee is a portion of your first-year university fee, paid to reserve the seat. It ranges from $500-$1000 and is not an additional fee. 

From the $1500 you saved with Edoofa, the registration fee will be paid to the university, securing the seat. For instance, if the registration fee is $1000, Edoofa will pay $1000 from the $1500 saved in 10 months. The updated balance with Edoofa will be $500, which will be paid to the university upon your arrival in India.
5/2/24, 3:21 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This eases the financial burden on the parent, as there is no immediate payment required upon the student's arrival. The $500 saved will cover the remaining fees for the semester/year, as specified in the offer letter from the university. What are your thoughts on this?
6/2/24, 11:40 AM - +263 77 289 2997: It's really a good idea to start saving now.
6/2/24, 11:41 AM - +263 77 289 2997: Good morning. Sorry there was a netwek problem this side
6/2/24, 11:54 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Chelsie.

I hope you are all doing wonderful today. I understand please, thank you for letting me know.
6/2/24, 11:54 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to see that we are together so far. With this plan for the next 10 months, I am sure you must be wondering what will happen in the next 10 months, considering you have already secured your scholarship seat with the university due to your hard work in the first 10 months. Is my understanding correct?
6/2/24, 11:57 AM - +263 77 289 2997: Yes you are very correct
6/2/24, 12:12 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Let me help you with that as well. In the 11th month, you will be guided to open an FBC Mastercard bank account in Zimbabwe with a deposit of $150. The reason for this is that when you apply for your student Visa, the Embassy asks for a Bank Statement, and this account will serve that purpose.
6/2/24, 12:12 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: We understand it might be expensive if you deposit another $1500 for the remaining 10 months in FB  Bank Zimbabwe, so to avoid the same challenges, we have designed the plan accordingly. You will only be depositing for the 11th, 12th, 13th, and 14th month, which is 4 months.
6/2/24, 12:12 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Once the 4 months are completed, our Department of Student Welfare (DSW) team will assist you with your visa process. The bank statement will act as one of the required documents, and once you receive the visa, you can withdraw the amount from FBC and book the flight ticket. This will help you utilize the money as well. How does it sound?
6/2/24, 12:32 PM - +263 77 289 2997: It's sounds good
6/2/24, 12:59 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, from the 16th Month till the 20th month, considering it is a 6-month window, you can again continue depositing the money ($150) with Edoofa which can be used in the fee as and when required or you can decide to save this $900 of these 6 months with you as well. This is something which you are free to choose. I hope you have understood the financial secure plan now?
7/2/24, 11:03 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Chelsie

I hope this message finds you well and filled with the same excitement that's buzzing here at Edoofa! It's that time of the year again when we eagerly anticipate our annual Meet and Greet Seminar in Harare. This event holds a special place in our hearts as it brings us closer to our community, and we're counting down the days with great anticipation!
7/2/24, 11:03 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Just like clockwork, we're gearing up for the seminar next week, and I couldn't resist sharing our enthusiasm with you. Your presence would truly make the event all the more meaningful, guiding you on your journey to India. Hence, with immense joy, we wanted to extend the special invitation for the Meet and Greet Seminar to you and your wonderful family.
7/2/24, 11:03 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: And in the process of doing the same, I happened to notice that you haven't started your EWYL Program by now. In light of this, I had a discussion with Ms. Sanjana, the head of the EWYL Department, and I am happy to share that she has graciously agreed to make a special exception for you, expediting your application process.
7/2/24, 11:03 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: As a result, I have gone ahead and created your very own dedicated EWYL Group - *Chelsie EWYL23E0959*, adding both you and your parents to the mix.

7/2/24, 4:45 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That's perfectly fine. In that case, we will conclude today's conversation, and I will connect with you tomorrow to resume our discussion.

Wishing you a good day ahead, and please extend our regards to your family.

8/2/24, 1:21 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Chelsie

Please, how are you doing today? With regards to our discussion yesterday, I wanted to reach out and enquire if you are available for us to have a brief conversation?
8/2/24, 1:42 PM - +263 77 289 2997: I'm fine. How are you this afternoon.
8/2/24, 1:43 PM - +263 77 289 2997: OK we can have a brief conversation
8/2/24, 2:14 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you are doing fine and are available for us to connect with each other. I am doing good, thank you for asking. Before reaching out to you today, I was going through pictures and videos from Edoofa's very first SLICE CON held last week, and that sparked my curiosity about whether you are familiar with what SLICE CON is or not?
8/2/24, 2:54 PM - +263 77 289 2997: I'm no familiar with Slice CON
8/2/24, 3:29 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is alright, Let me tell you a bit about the same.  Recently, Edoofa hosted a conference called the Symposium of Leaders, Innovators, and Creators at Edoofa, also known as 'SLICE-CON.'
8/2/24, 3:29 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: The conference was attended by all the Edoofians of 2023 and a few senior Edoofians from previous batches. It focused on the art of creation, innovation, and, most importantly, the mindset required to make an impact in one's career.
8/2/24, 3:29 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: During this Industrial Visit and the conference - SLICE CON, Corporate leaders, such as the CEOs and Co-founders from renowned companies like Rage Coffee, Sirona Hygiene, Jolin New York, and more, shared their insights and experiences.

Their presence added immense value, providing students with the opportunity to engage in transformative conversations.
8/2/24, 3:30 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Let me share a glimpse of the conference with you and your family. I am certain that Chelsie too would be this excited to attend such events when he comes to India.

8/2/24, 3:55 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Also, regarding the discussion we had the other day about the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan, I wanted to follow up on our last conversation. Have you, as a family, been able to discuss it? If so, I would like to understand how the discussion went. What were their thoughts about it? Did they have any specific queries or concerns that you would like us to address?
8/2/24, 3:56 PM - +263 77 289 2997: Yes I have gone though the messages about Slice CON, along with the images and videos. This is good for the students and for us as parents
8/2/24, 4:01 PM - +263 77 289 2997: We will discuss tonight. Yesterday we failed
8/2/24, 4:15 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. In such a case, let us conclude our conversation for today and we will reconnect tomorrow. I hope that by then you will be able to have a detailed discussion with your family.

Have a blessed day ahead!

I trust you are having a delightful weekend. On this pleasant Saturday afternoon, I hope you are presently available for a discussion. Before we begin, I would like to check in and ask how are things with you today?

10/2/24, 3:12 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. I am doing well, thank you for asking. I wanted to reach out and inquire if you were able to discuss the Financial Secure Plan with your family yet?
10/2/24, 3:42 PM - +263 77 289 2997: Yes we did. And we are in for the plan
12/2/24, 7:37 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Chelsie.

I hope you had a wonderful weekend. Thank you for letting me know, Parents and Chelsie. For the current round of students, there are only 27 seats available for the students who can benefit from the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan. 

Since you have been one of the most dedicated students, and I see you have great aspirations, I wanted you to be a part of the same set of students and start with your future planning the right way.
12/2/24, 7:37 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Also, as this plan commences from the month of February, for the efficient implementation of this plan, we need to decide on a fixed date on which you will deposit $150 every month. This will provide you with the flexibility to align your finances accordingly.
12/2/24, 7:37 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Our complete focus is on providing students and parents with the best ways to avail themselves of these opportunities. We understand that every parent may not be able to make the payment on our specified date. Therefore, considering this situation, we allow them to decide the payment date according to their comfort. In light of the same, may I know the fixed date every month on which you will deposit $150?
12/2/24, 9:38 AM - +263 77 289 2997: We are fine. Good morning.
I will be able to pay on the fifth of every month.
12/2/24, 9:49 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing these details, your commitment to securing a seat in this exclusive program is appreciated.

To proceed with the next steps, we will be sharing an official agreement detailing the specifics of the Financial Secure Plan along with its benefits. This agreement is a crucial document that outlines the terms and conditions of your participation in the program. It serves as a legal framework ensuring transparency and mutual understanding between all parties involved.
12/2/24, 9:49 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: As we prepare to send you the agreement, we kindly request the following details to personalize the document:

1. Full Name of Parent/Guardian/Sponsor responsible for catering to the student's finances [The representative in whose name you want the agreement to be]


2. Residential Address of the aforementioned representative.

12/2/24, 10:25 AM - +263 77 289 2997: I'm the parent and below are my details.
Memory Musonza
House number 4846 murisa Park seke Chitungwiza
12/2/24, 10:45 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for providing the required details for the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan. Your response is greatly appreciated, and we are pleased to inform you that we have duly noted the information you shared.

Our team will now proceed to draft your official agreement based on the provided details. We aim to deliver the agreement to you by today for your careful review and consideration.
12/2/24, 10:45 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Securing a seat in the Financial Secure Plan is a significant step that goes beyond financial assistance. It opens doors to numerous benefits designed to support and enhance your educational journey.

I look forward to reconnecting with you today to guide you through the agreement and discuss the way forward. Should you have any queries in the interim, feel free to reach out to us at any time.
12/2/24, 10:46 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Before we conclude our conversation, I would like to inquire, since the 5th of this month has already passed, may I know when you will be able to make the payment for the month of February, so that we can draft the agreement accordingly?
12/2/24, 10:51 AM - +263 77 289 2997: The month of February I will pay on the 5th of March. Then for the. Month of March I will pay on the 5th of April. And  the list goes like that
12/2/24, 10:55 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. However, the plan is scheduled to begin in the month of February itself, so that we are successfully able to make timely progress in the plan and save $1500 by the end of November. I hope we are on the same page here?
12/2/24, 10:57 AM - +263 77 289 2997: Yes I agree
12/2/24, 11:23 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: In such a case, would it be more suitable for you if we move the monthly payment date towards the end of month, so that you are able to accommodate the payment for the month of February, or do you wish to keep the monthly deposit date as the 5th and you want to continue with making an exception in the month of February?
13/2/24, 10:16 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Chelsie,
