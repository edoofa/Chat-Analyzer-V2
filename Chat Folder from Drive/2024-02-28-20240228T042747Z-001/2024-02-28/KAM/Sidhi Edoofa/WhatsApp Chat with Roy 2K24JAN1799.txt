I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them.

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
6/2/24, 1:41 PM - +263 77 393 5053: Yes
6/2/24, 1:51 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
6/2/24, 2:00 PM - +263 77 393 5053: Thanks l am done
6/2/24, 2:08 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
6/2/24, 2:08 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
6/2/24, 2:45 PM - +263 77 393 5053: Thank you, very clear.
6/2/24, 3:06 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 3: Introduction to the Financial Secure Plan* - Parents with children embarking on their university journey within the next one to two years face important decision-making and rigorous financial planning. Edoofa recognizes the significance of this transition and hence has introduced the Edoofa Secure Plan - a unique and systematic strategy to empower parents in financial planning and preparing for their child's tertiary education well in advance.
6/2/24, 3:06 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Scholarship Offer Letter from the university would be issued next year in the month of August.

I hope you are following?
6/2/24, 3:25 PM - +263 77 393 5053: Noted thank you
6/2/24, 4:01 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. The registration fee will be paid through the savings you have accumulated visa the Financial Secure Plan. After the registration fee is paid, for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
6/2/24, 4:01 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
6/2/24, 4:24 PM - +263 77 393 5053: Noted thank you
6/2/24, 4:50 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through all 6 steps, if we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?

8/2/24, 1:27 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Could you kindly share what you were able to understand from each video?
8/2/24, 2:00 PM - +263 77 393 5053: 1st video - Important qualities for securing maximum scholarship and earning scholarship credits are being open minded and willing to go an extra mile.                       Video 2 - Edoofa's vision is for you to have maximum capacity towards attaining success.                           Video 3 - Edoofa has invested much time to find good  universities which will give students good learning experience and passes.                       Right kind of attributes, skills and knowledge makes a student employable.                      Festival of colours for fun and making friends.       Video 4 - Statement of purpose. To convince the admission body ,stating your academic achievements, your uniqueness, your vision, why you chose the school and other important facts.
8/2/24, 3:16 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. Let me share my views as well so that it will help you expand your understanding.

*Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students:* In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. 

You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent.
8/2/24, 3:16 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s vision for you:* Here our founders talk about the most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of tomorrow.
8/2/24, 3:16 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program:* Talking about the third video, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
8/2/24, 3:16 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP:* Another thing is that Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based. 

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
8/2/24, 3:17 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose. I hope you were able to follow through with this?
8/2/24, 3:33 PM - +263 77 393 5053: Yes I have followed through.
8/2/24, 3:54 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Glad to hear that. Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by tomorrow before our session.
8/2/24, 3:54 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded.

9/2/24, 7:10 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: We were unable to connect today. However, as promised, now that you are a part of the Edoofa Journey, the opportunity to help you self-fund your higher education and for you to be industry-ready s here, and in light of the same, I would like to assist you in getting started with your EWYL Journey. Based on your EWYL application form, you are scheduled to commence your EWYL journey on Friday (9 February 2024).
9/2/24, 7:10 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: With your intention and commencement date in mind, we have already communicated this information to the EWYL team. They are prepared to initiate your EWYL program on Friday, as previously agreed upon.

To kick start the process, your dedicated EWYL Mentor has established your EWYL Group and shared the invitation link with us. Here's what you and your parents/guardian/sponsor need to do:

10/2/24, 9:39 AM - +263 77 393 5053: Roy JNR Madhiri is not doing Chemistry and was advised to apply for Bachelor of Electrical Engineering. The interview questions above are they the same .
10/2/24, 1:13 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Roy.

I trust you are having a delightful weekend. On this pleasant Saturday afternoon, I hope you are presently available for a discussion. Before we begin, I would like to check in and ask how are things with you today?
10/2/24, 1:14 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. Thank you for pointing that out. Kindly excuse me for the confusion from my end. Please go through the below set of questions, that is meant for Electrical Engineering.
10/2/24, 1:15 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
10/2/24, 1:37 PM - +263 77 393 5053: Afternoon , connected
10/2/24, 1:37 PM - +263 77 393 5053: Noted thank you
10/2/24, 2:22 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. May I know if you were able to complete the SOP form?
10/2/24, 2:24 PM - +263 77 393 5053: Not yet
10/2/24, 3:14 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. Could you kindly let me know by when you will be able to complete the same?
10/2/24, 3:48 PM - +263 77 393 5053: Monday 13 February 2024
12/2/24, 7:39 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Roy.

I hope you had a wonderful weekend. Thank you for letting me know that. May I know if you were able to complete the tasks, Roy?
12/2/24, 7:47 AM - +263 77 393 5053: <Media omitted>
12/2/24, 7:47 AM - +263 77 393 5053: <Media omitted>
12/2/24, 8:26 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the tasks with me, Roy. With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey, i.e. *Introduction to Financial Secure Plan*.
12/2/24, 8:26 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: However, before we start the same, I was going through your scholarship application file and noticed that you are supposed to make the payment of your remaining part of Edoofa Enrollment fee. Hence, I thought of sharing a gentle reminder with you and trying to understand how your preparation has been so far? Have you been able to align your preparations in the right direction?
12/2/24, 8:41 AM - +263 77 393 5053: Noted thank you. I still have 150us balance and will definitely pay before the deadline.
12/2/24, 8:59 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. We will reconnect with each other a few days before your due date to take a follow up on this and understand your preparations better. 

In the meantime, Let us move forward with our discussion. To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is B.Tech (Electrical Engineering) and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2025. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
12/2/24, 9:25 AM - +263 77 393 5053: Very correct
12/2/24, 9:32 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. Based on our experience of over 14 years and having assisted over 5000 students from different countries, we have realized that financial planning is the most important factor when a student plans for their higher education abroad.
12/2/24, 9:32 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am sure that you must be aware that 20-30% of students who are admitted into universities abroad are unable to fulfill their dream and come to India due to a lack of financial planning. The funds needed for booking flights, accommodation, and covering living expenses after arrival often become overwhelming, leading to the decision to defer their admission for a year. This, in turn, creates a gap in the child's education.
12/2/24, 9:32 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: To assist both students and parents in this regard, Edoofa Management has designed a Financial Secure Plan that aims to help you prepare for your higher educational finances without experiencing stress or last-minute rushes. I believe you must be wondering about the details of the same plan and how it helps the parents?
12/2/24, 9:37 AM - +263 77 393 5053: Thank you , Can you explain how we do it.
12/2/24, 9:45 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Edoofa Secure Plan is important for parents who have children joining the university for tertiary education in the next one to two years for several reasons:
12/2/24, 9:45 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: 1. *Financial Preparedness:* The Edoofa Secure plan helps parents prepare financially for the costs after the Scholarship being offered so that they are not caught off guard.

2. *Reduced Financial Stress:* Having the Edoofa Secure Plan in place can significantly reduce the financial stress on you as parents when your child is about to enter university. Knowing that there is a dedicated fund for education expenses provides peace of mind.
12/2/24, 9:45 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: 3. *Avoiding Debt*: Without proper savings, some parents may resort to taking out loans or accumulating credit card debt to cover their child's education costs. This Educational savings plan helps avoid the burden of debt and high-interest payments.

4. *Compound Interest:* By starting to save early and consistently contributing to the savings plan, parents can take advantage of compound interest, which can significantly increase the amount available for education expenses.
12/2/24, 9:45 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: 5. *Flexibility and Control:* The Edoofa Secure savings plans allow parents to have greater control over their finances and how they allocate funds for their child's education. They can choose investment options that align with their risk tolerance and financial goals.

6. *Encouraging Responsibility*: Involving your child in the process of saving for their education teaches them financial responsibility and the value of higher education. It also motivates them to outperform in Academics.
12/2/24, 9:45 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: 7. *Adapting to Unexpected Changes*: Life is full of surprises, and circumstances can change especially when there are political reforms changing each day impacting the Local Currency. Having an Edoofa Secure Plan allows parents to adapt to unexpected changes in their financial situation while still prioritizing their child's education.

8. *Peace of Mind:* Overall, having the Edoofa Secure plan provides parents with peace of mind, knowing that they are actively planning for their child's future and increasing the likelihood of providing them with a solid education.
12/2/24, 9:45 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, when you go through all the above benefits, I am sure you can see that the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan is an important financial tool for parents/students who are supposed to enter the university soon. 

It helps ensure that the financial aspect of tertiary education is well-managed, reduces stress, and allows parents to provide the best opportunities for their children without resorting to debt or financial hardship. Isn't this something you and your family also wish to have?
12/2/24, 10:03 AM - +263 77 393 5053: It's a good idea
12/2/24, 10:03 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through the above points, do you want me to help you understand how the Edoofa Secure Plan works?
12/2/24, 10:25 AM - +263 77 393 5053: Yes
12/2/24, 10:41 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that. Before we proceed with our discussion, I would like to inquire if you were able to join your EWYL group and share the message with your mentor?
12/2/24, 12:36 PM - +263 77 393 5053: I joined the group but hasn't shared anything on the group yet.
12/2/24, 1:17 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Could you kindly share the above message on the group to let your mentor know that you have successfully joined the group and are ready to begin your EWYL journey?
12/2/24, 4:07 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: @263773935053 may I know if we are still connected?
12/2/24, 8:11 PM - +263 77 393 5053: Yes l did
13/2/24, 12:05 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Roy,

I hope you are doing great. Before we proceed with our discussion, I would like to check in and ask how your day has been going so far?
13/2/24, 12:06 PM - +263 77 393 5053: Thank you , everything is good.
13/2/24, 1:20 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Allow me to proceed with our discussion. As you are aware, we are currently in February 2024, and we have a good 20 months to plan for your finances before you start your university education in 2025.
13/2/24, 1:31 PM - +263 77 393 5053: You are welcome
13/2/24, 1:32 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: During the counseling session, you were informed that at Edoofa, we guarantee a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship on the tuition fees. Hence, the cost of education, including food and accommodation after the scholarship, would be between $2000-$3000, and it could be even less. Not more than that.
13/2/24, 1:32 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This means that if you can save $150 per month for the next 20 months, you will be able to save $3000. This amount is more than enough for the first year of university fees, including tuition fees (if any), food, and accommodation. I hope you agree with this?
13/2/24, 2:09 PM - +263 77 393 5053: This was not in my business plan. I need two months to resume a minimum of 100us per months.
14/2/24, 8:39 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Dear Parents and Roy,

22/2/24, 1:07 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Roy,

I hope you are all doing great. It has been a while since we last connected, and our team has had quite hectic past few days. As you already know, over the past three days, Team Edoofa has been bustling with activity – both in India and Harare for the Meet and Greet '24. Now that things have settled down a bit, I wanted to express my sincere gratitude to you for participating in the event and playing a role in its success. I would like to share a few glimpses of the seminar with you, which demonstrates how enthusiastic and engaged our students were!
22/2/24, 1:07 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
22/2/24, 1:07 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
22/2/24, 1:07 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
22/2/24, 1:07 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Your insights from the event are incredibly valuable, and I'm keen to hear about your experience. Would you be willing to share your thoughts, including your interest in attending similar events in the future and any suggestions for improvement? Moreover, if you've captured any memorable moments in photos, we would greatly appreciate it if you could share them with us.
22/2/24, 3:02 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Roy,

I trust this message finds you well. I would like to inform you that our company will be observing holidays on Friday and Saturday, therefore, we will be unavailable during this time. Hence, we will resume our sessions on Monday.

Until then, I wish you a blessed week ahead. Kindly convey my regards to your family as well.
22/2/24, 3:57 PM - +263 77 393 5053: Noted thank you
26/2/24, 10:44 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Roy,

I hope you had a wonderful weekend. Over the weekend, our team engaged in discussions regarding the Meet and Greet Seminar, reflecting on the valuable insights gained from interacting with our students. The experience was truly enriching for us, and we hope it was equally enjoyable for you as well.

Before we proceed with our discussion today, I would like to inquire how you are doing this fine morning?
26/2/24, 11:41 AM - +263 77 393 5053: I am really good
26/2/24, 11:50 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Could you kindly let me know if you were able to go through my previous messages about the Meet and Greet Seminar and can share your experience of the same?
26/2/24, 1:55 PM - +263 77 393 5053: About the seminar, it was a great experience meeting the EDOOFA team in person, meeting with current EDOOFIANS and a lot of other aspiring candidates. The team answered questions from us as well as gave us an insight of the learner's experience in India through videos.well informed us on the importance of making financial plans now than later.
26/2/24, 1:59 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your experience at the seminar with me. I am pleased to hear that you had a good time there meeting with our team and other Edoofians. We definitely look forward to hosting more such events in the future!

During our previous session, we were discussing about the Financial Secure Plan and how by the time you would be in India, you would have already saved the $3000 that will cover the first-year fee.
26/2/24, 1:59 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, in these next 20 months, I am sure you would also be engaged in the EWYL program, and if you secure a minimum of $1000 in 20 months, that means the fees for 1.5 years are already secured.
26/2/24, 1:59 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, for a 3-year course, if we follow the same approach for the remaining 1.5 years, the educational journey for the student and the financial journey for the parent will be easy and smooth. I believe you must be able to see this perspective?
26/2/24, 2:04 PM - +263 77 393 5053: Yes
26/2/24, 2:05 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. With that said, there is also another benefit, I am sure being in Zimbabwe you know how drastically the exchange rate fluctuates.
26/2/24, 2:05 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: If you are buying a dollar today, you might be spending 7000 bonds, but if you buy a dollar after a month, the rate would be different.
26/2/24, 2:05 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Also, even if you choose to buy dollars every month and save at your home, it is not safe since there is news of robbery, and mugging every day.
26/2/24, 2:05 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: In that case, you will opt to save in the Bank, but again we know that savings in the Bank require a Nostro Account which means you have to pay the bank to keep your money safe, right?
26/2/24, 3:02 PM - +263 77 393 5053: True
27/2/24, 12:30 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Roy,

I hope you are doing well today. Kindly excuse me for not being able to respond to your last message as I was not feeling well and had to conclude my day early. However, I am pleased to let you know that I am feeling better today and eager to proceed with our discussion. Before we do so, I would like to ask how your day has been going so far?
27/2/24, 1:11 PM - +263 77 393 5053: Noted thank you. My day is good
27/2/24, 1:22 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. During our previous discussion, we were talking about various constraints related to the dollar exchange rate, considering its fluctuation, safety concerns associated with keeping cash at home, and the expenses tied to maintaining a Nostro Account in banks for safekeeping.
27/2/24, 1:22 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Considering these constraints, Edoofa Management has decided to help the parents and students prepare for the journey way ahead of time by helping them save money with Edoofa without any additional charges but rather saving additional money as well. Do you want me to explain how this has been achieved?
27/2/24, 1:28 PM - +263 77 393 5053: Yes
27/2/24, 1:38 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Program Fee (Enrollment Fee) that you were asked to pay is $350. From the $350, you have already paid $200, and the remaining $150 is what you are planning to pay by tomorrow before your due date.
27/2/24, 1:38 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Under the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan, a parent has to deposit a small amount of money which is $150 every month for the next 10 months. 

That means, in 10 months, the money saved will be $1500. When this money is saved, Edoofa will waive off the remaining $150 which was due from the Edoofa Program/Enrollment Fee of $350, thereby making a straight saving of $150 in 10 months.
27/2/24, 1:38 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Imagine you paying $15 every month to the Bank of Zimbabwe to keep your money safe, and here Edoofa is paying you $15 every month to keep your money safe. Now, you must be wondering, why only for 10 months and not for 20 months, right?
27/2/24, 2:06 PM - +263 77 393 5053: I'm a little lost,does that mean that I can start to pay my monthly deposits of 150 for 10 months and then I will not have to pay for the remaining enrollment fee of $150?
27/2/24, 2:11 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is indeed correct. Upon successful completion of the first 10 months of the Financial Secure Plan, your remaining amount of $150 towards your enrollment fee will be waived off. I hope that is clear?
27/2/24, 2:17 PM - +263 77 393 5053: Very clear and I'm very glad.
27/2/24, 2:19 PM - +263 77 393 5053: You also stated a question on why 10 months and not 20,may I know the answer?
27/2/24, 2:21 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Surely! If you see the bigger picture, you will realize that the reason is quite simple. Upon the completion of the 10 installments, the Edoofa Admissions team will initiate the Child’s Admission Process by applying early to the universities to secure their scholarship and their university seat.
27/2/24, 2:21 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Reserving seats earlier increases the chances of obtaining a maximum scholarship. A higher scholarship means lower fees, and by securing the seat, you will be entitled to pay the fees as per the old fee structure of the university, not the new one implemented in January 2025. Furthermore, when applying to the universities, you will receive an offer letter or a letter of intent detailing the fees, scholarship, and registration fees.
27/2/24, 2:21 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: As explained during the enrollment process, the registration fee is a portion of your first-year university fee, paid to reserve the seat. It ranges from $500-$1000 and is not an additional fee. 

From the $1500 you saved with Edoofa, the registration fee will be paid to the university, securing the seat. For instance, if the registration fee is $1000, Edoofa will pay $1000 from the $1500 saved in 10 months. The updated balance with Edoofa will be $500, which will be paid to the university upon your arrival in India.
27/2/24, 2:21 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This eases the financial burden on the parent, as there is no immediate payment required upon the student's arrival. The $500 saved will cover the remaining fees for the semester/year, as specified in the offer letter from the university. What are your thoughts on this?
27/2/24, 2:25 PM - +263 77 393 5053: I think it's clear. It is beneficial and of an advantage to pay early.
27/2/24, 2:36 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to see that we are together so far. With this plan for the next 10 months, I am sure you must be wondering what will happen in the next 10 months, considering you have already secured your scholarship seat with the university due to your hard work in the first 10 months. Is my understanding correct?
27/2/24, 2:40 PM - +263 77 393 5053: I think it's good to know.
27/2/24, 3:17 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Let me help you with that as well. In the 11th month, you will be guided to open an FBC Mastercard bank account in Zimbabwe with a deposit of $150. The reason for this is that when you apply for your student Visa, the Embassy asks for a Bank Statement, and this account will serve that purpose.
27/2/24, 3:17 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: We understand it might be expensive if you deposit another $1500 for the remaining 10 months in FB  Bank Zimbabwe, so to avoid the same challenges, we have designed the plan accordingly. You will only be depositing for the 11th, 12th, 13th, and 14th month, which is 4 months.
27/2/24, 3:17 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Once the 4 months are completed, our Department of Student Welfare (DSW) team will assist you with your visa process. The bank statement will act as one of the required documents, and once you receive the visa, you can withdraw the amount from FBC and book the flight ticket. This will help you utilize the money as well. How does it sound?
27/2/24, 3:36 PM - +263 77 393 5053: Really good , thank you
27/2/24, 3:36 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, from the 16th Month till the 20th month, considering it is a 6-month window, you can again continue depositing the money ($150) with Edoofa which can be used in the fee as and when required or you can decide to save this $900 of these 6 months with you as well. This is something which you are free to choose. I hope you have understood the financial secure plan now?
