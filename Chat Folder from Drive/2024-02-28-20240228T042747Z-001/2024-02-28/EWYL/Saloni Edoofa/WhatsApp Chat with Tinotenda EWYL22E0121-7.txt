27/12/23, 8:48 AM - +91 78891 60553: I would like to know when our next session will be.
27/12/23, 9:14 AM - Saloni Edoofa: Good afternoon Tinotenda,
How are you?
27/12/23, 9:15 AM - Saloni Edoofa: Our sessions will resume from the new year onwards, currently, we have given you time to enjoy this festive season but primarily, prepare well for your exams.
27/12/23, 9:15 AM - Saloni Edoofa: So, how are your exams going?
27/12/23, 10:05 AM - +91 78891 60553: Okay mam thank you
27/12/23, 10:05 AM - +91 78891 60553: They are okay mam thank you for asking.
27/12/23, 10:50 AM - Saloni Edoofa: When will the exams end?
27/12/23, 11:30 AM - +91 78891 60553: On the 6th mam

28/12/23, 8:18 AM - Saloni Edoofa: Good morning Tinotenda,
How are you?
28/12/23, 8:21 AM - Saloni Edoofa: Well, I wanted to discuss the upcoming Industrial visit with you like how you will be contributing to it, what your expectations are, and how it is going to roll. Still, on pondering over your presence with me in the sessions, I became a bit doubtful. On the other side, when I had a discussion with Mr. Sagar about your performance, he was very thrilled. May I know what challenges were you facing or do you wish to share anything with me?
28/12/23, 9:36 AM - +91 78891 60553: I am doing very well thank you for asking.
28/12/23, 9:41 AM - +91 78891 60553: Due to the fact that l had to cover up what others had done before l came was kind of a struggle to me. I had assignments, lectures and presentations which needed my attention. On the other hand l had to attend the webinars and sessions and l really tried to balance them but it was bit of a hustle. But as we approach the second semester l think it's going to be better and less of a hustle.

29/12/23, 4:02 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day,

You know when I was a student and till now, I make agendas on what I wish to achieve in life this year, and how I can transform it for the betterment of not just myself, but my family and the people around me. Honestly, some targets seemed achievable, but I always kept a few that made me thrive beyond my boundaries to achieve them.
I, as your wellwisher and companion, wish you that you also push yourself and make the most of the opportunities that are coming your way starting from the EWYL Program that offers you a chance to *stand on your own feet*. Next year, _we will be a few months away from our flight to India_✈️, and I want to see you living a journey till that time that is filled with *hard work and dedication*.

25/1/24, 2:16 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Good day, Tinotenda
I hope you're doing well.

I know from the past few days, that I could not respond but allow me to share a story very close to my heart🫰🏻

I became a part of Edoofa almost two years back with initial thoughts on how my relationship would be, will I be a good mentor, or will I be able to think like my students, and so on. With these thoughts, I began my journey. Honestly speaking, I learned a lot each day, and yes, made some mistakes but I did not know that now there is going something that I will cherish for my lifetime, our bond. In this journey so far, I have guided more than 500 students, and beyond guidance I have made sure that I can create a transformation in their lives🌟
25/1/24, 2:24 PM - Saloni Edoofa: As an individual, I always believe that the learning process is life never ends and the more you learn, the better the guidance becomes, with a heavy heart, *I've chosen to immerse myself in higher education, and as a result, I'll be taking a step back from being your mentor🥺*
*You have a special place in my heart, and I am profoundly thankful for the honor of being your mentor*. Our journey doesn't end here; it merely takes a different course. I have full confidence in your continued success.

*I want to assure you that the Department of Student DSW) team will reach out to you soon to discuss the upcoming plan and ensure a seamless transition.*
All the best🫶🏻
25/1/24, 3:28 PM - +91 78891 60553: It was indeed a great journey mam. I would also like to thank you for being more than just my mentor. You were there guiding and supporting me through this journey. All the best in your journey and l hope we will get a chance to meet in the future 🫶🏻.
27/2/24, 11:49 AM - +91 78891 60553: Good day sir how are you
