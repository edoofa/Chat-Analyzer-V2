15/1/24, 4:04 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Congratulations on your outstanding success in the advanced-level exams! Your hard work and dedication have truly paid off, and I'm incredibly proud of you. As your mentor, witnessing your growth and resilience has been inspiring. Your achievement is well-deserved, and I'm confident this is just the beginning of your remarkable journey. Congratulations once again, and I look forward to seeing your continued success🫶🏻👏🏼

Also, I would want you to share the same with your Admission Team on priority if not done.
15/1/24, 4:16 PM - +263 77 632 7102: Noted thank you
27/1/24, 8:43 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Good day!
I hope you're doing well.

I know from the past few days, that I could not respond but allow me to share a story very close to my heart🫰🏻

I became a part of Edoofa almost two years back with initial thoughts on how my relationship would be, will I be a good mentor, or will I be able to think like my students, and so on. With these thoughts, I began my journey. Honestly speaking, I learned a lot each day, and yes, made some mistakes but I did not know that now there is going something that I will cherish for my lifetime, our bond. In this journey so far, I have guided more than 500 students, and beyond guidance I have made sure that I can create a transformation in their lives🌟
27/1/24, 8:43 PM - Saloni Edoofa: As an individual, I always believe that the learning process is life never ends and the more you learn, the better the guidance becomes, with a heavy heart, *I've chosen to immerse myself in higher education, and as a result, I'll be taking a step back from being your mentor🥺*
*You have a special place in my heart, and I am profoundly thankful for the honor of being your mentor*. Our journey doesn't end here; it merely takes a different course. I have full confidence in your continued success.

*I want to assure you that the Mentorship team will reach out to you soon to discuss the upcoming plan and ensure a seamless transition.*
All the best🫶🏻
27/1/24, 9:21 PM - +263 78 128 5721: Ok thank you Mrs Saloni
