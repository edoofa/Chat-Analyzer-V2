I am kindly asking for your help to assist him in the resumption of his journey with EDOOFA.

27/1/24, 8:44 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Good day!
I hope you're doing well.

I know from the past few days, that I could not respond but allow me to share a story very close to my heart🫰🏻

I became a part of Edoofa almost two years back with initial thoughts on how my relationship would be, will I be a good mentor, or will I be able to think like my students, and so on. With these thoughts, I began my journey. Honestly speaking, I learned a lot each day, and yes, made some mistakes but I did not know that now there is going something that I will cherish for my lifetime, our bond. In this journey so far, I have guided more than 500 students, and beyond guidance I have made sure that I can create a transformation in their lives🌟
27/1/24, 8:44 PM - Saloni Edoofa: As an individual, I always believe that the learning process is life never ends and the more you learn, the better the guidance becomes, with a heavy heart, *I've chosen to immerse myself in higher education, and as a result, I'll be taking a step back from being your mentor🥺*
*You have a special place in my heart, and I am profoundly thankful for the honor of being your mentor*. Our journey doesn't end here; it merely takes a different course. I have full confidence in your continued success.

*I want to assure you that the Mentorship team will reach out to you soon to discuss the upcoming plan and ensure a seamless transition.*
All the best🫶🏻
31/1/24, 2:35 PM - +263 78 972 4211: Greetings of the day to you Ms. Saloni and your team.


It is very unfortunate that you will no longer  be part of the EDOOFA team, l have to say that it is saddening news but as you said this is not the end  but just a journey taking a different course. I would like to thank you for being my mentor; and just as _Bob  Proctor_ put it " a mentor is someone who sees more talent and  ability within you, than you see yourself and helps bring it out of you." I want to thank you for doing just that. I shall forever cherish the lessons you taught me and the skills that came with them. 

Thank you very much,l wish you good luck in the pursuit of your Higher education
