28/12/23, 8:06 AM - Saloni Edoofa: Hello Talent,
I hope this message finds you well.

As we approach the end of the year, I am filled with excitement about the upcoming new year. It's a time for optimism, hope, and the opportunity to nurture beautifully curated relationships. However, upon reflection on our journey so far, I recognize a bit of inconsistency and irregularity.

I understand that the holiday season, including Christmas celebrations and New Year enjoyment, may be keeping you occupied. Despite this, I believe it's important for us to consider how we can strengthen our relationship in the EWYL Program. I am eager to hear your thoughts on how we can restart and enhance our collaboration.
29/12/23, 3:31 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day,

You know when I was a student and till now, I make agendas on what I wish to achieve in life this year, and how I can transform it for the betterment of not just myself, but my family and the people around me. Honestly, some targets seemed achievable, but I always kept a few that made me thrive beyond my boundaries to achieve them.
I, as your wellwisher and companion, wish you that you also push yourself and make the most of the opportunities that are coming your way starting from the EWYL Program that offers you a chance to *stand on your own feet*. Next year, _we will be a few months away from our flight to India_✈️, and I want to see you living a journey till that time that is filled with *hard work and dedication*. I have personally curated this message from the bottom of my heart to wish you a very *Happy New Year, 2024* 🫶🏻

3. There is an additional opportunity to earn $5 worth of Scholarship credits by connecting with students to provide clarity to them about the Edoofa Scholarship, which the Edoofa team will share with you!
18/1/24, 10:30 AM - +263 78 677 6631: Splendid then , l definitely understood this part
18/1/24, 10:37 AM - Saloni Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
18/1/24, 10:38 AM - Saloni Edoofa: *Using WhatsApp Community Groups for Outreach:*
*Step 1*: Create a WhatsApp group and name it using the format STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DDMMYYYY. For example, if you're the mentor, it would be *Talent/Saloni/18JAN2024*.

*Step 2*: Find the right students for your group to ensure effective communication about Edoofa.

*Purpose*: The goal is to reach a broad audience, providing accurate information about Edoofa to prepare them for a smooth counseling session.
18/1/24, 10:38 AM - Saloni Edoofa: Execution:

*Identify Potential Candidates:* - Reach out to students in Form 6 or those who have recently passed Form 6 (A-Level Examination).

*Connect with Form 6 Divisions*: - Assume there are 3 divisions in Form 6, each with around 20 students. Begin with one division. Connect with these students and request to be added to their official or unofficial WhatsApp group. <This message was edited>
18/1/24, 10:38 AM - Saloni Edoofa: *Share Your Group Link*: - Once added, share the link to your created WhatsApp group, explaining that it's an opportunity to pursue education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on tuition fees. Encourage them to join for more details.

*Repeat the Process*: - Move on to the next divisions of Form 6, applying the same approach. In this way, you'll reach at least 60 students (3 divisions of Form 6).

*Extend to Form 5*: - Repeat the process in Form 5, targeting another 60 students.
18/1/24, 10:42 AM - +263 78 677 6631: I understand the assignment and I'll do my best to reach out to a broad audience
18/1/24, 10:49 AM - Saloni Edoofa: *Result*:

You would have effectively shared information about Edoofa with a minimum of 120 students, creating awareness and interest among potential applicants. This method ensures a wide reach and prepares students for the upcoming counseling sessions.
18/1/24, 10:53 AM - Saloni Edoofa: Have you understood?
18/1/24, 10:54 AM - +263 78 677 6631: Yeah l understand and l never really thought of it that way , with such a detailed explanation l see now what needs to be done
18/1/24, 11:01 AM - Saloni Edoofa: We will resume our discussion tomorrow in our session from 10:00 - 11:00 AM in the EWYL Group. I am sure you will be available at that time🫱🏻‍🫲🏼
19/1/24, 10:03 AM - Saloni Edoofa: Good day, everyone!
How are you doing?

May we begin with our session?
19/1/24, 11:06 AM - Saloni Edoofa: Our sessions will resume next week, from *Tuesday* onwards, between *10:00 - 11:00 AM*. Unfortunately, due to some family commitments on Monday, I'll be occupied, and our session may not occur. However, I want you to go through everything that we have discussed so far in this time.

Just so you know, there will be no sessions held on Saturday and Sunday, allowing for a well-deserved break.

Wishing you a fantastic weekend ahead filled with joy and relaxation! 🌺
27/1/24, 8:41 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Good day!
I hope you're doing well.

I know from the past few days, that I could not respond but allow me to share a story very close to my heart🫰🏻

I became a part of Edoofa almost two years back with initial thoughts on how my relationship would be, will I be a good mentor, or will I be able to think like my students, and so on. With these thoughts, I began my journey. Honestly speaking, I learned a lot each day, and yes, made some mistakes but I did not know that now there is going something that I will cherish for my lifetime, our bond. In this journey so far, I have guided more than 500 students, and beyond guidance I have made sure that I can create a transformation in their lives🌟
27/1/24, 8:41 PM - Saloni Edoofa: As an individual, I always believe that the learning process is life never ends and the more you learn, the better the guidance becomes, with a heavy heart, *I've chosen to immerse myself in higher education, and as a result, I'll be taking a step back from being your mentor🥺*
*You have a special place in my heart, and I am profoundly thankful for the honor of being your mentor*. Our journey doesn't end here; it merely takes a different course. I have full confidence in your continued success.

*I want to assure you that the Mentorship team will reach out to you soon to discuss the upcoming plan and ensure a seamless transition.*
All the best🫶🏻
28/1/24, 1:14 PM - +263 78 677 6631: Im filled with a rush of mixed emotions right now lm both happy and heart broken 😭🥹💔 you've made a huge impact in my life Ms Saloni both as my mentor and my friend l am really gonna miss you a lot but l am however l wish you all the best on your new found journey and l hope you manage to thrive 💯

 *We send you lots of love 🥰 Ms Saloni*
1/2/24, 1:14 PM - +263 78 677 6631: Good afternoon l hope you had a pleasant morning l was just making an inquiry on the issue of my new mentor since Ms Saloni had to unfortunately step down from the post
1/2/24, 3:15 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Good afternoon, Talent

While we were having multiple conversations with our students in the past few days for the meet & greet event, we figured that there is a slight confusion in the invitation dates. Hence, I wanted to quickly reach out and ensure that the same is not the case with you.

- As per the invitation, *you* are supposed to attend the event along with your parents on *19th of February* which is Monday.
 
- If you are recommending any of *your friends (Non Edoofians)* along with their parents to attend the event, as per their choice, the seminar is scheduled for *18th of February (8am/1pm) or 19th February(1pm)*. They should carry a physical copy of their admit cards to enter the event.
17/2/24, 8:40 AM - Saloni Edoofa: Please ensure that you are present at the venue 30 minutes earlier and are dressed appropriately.
Don't forget to carry your admit card!
