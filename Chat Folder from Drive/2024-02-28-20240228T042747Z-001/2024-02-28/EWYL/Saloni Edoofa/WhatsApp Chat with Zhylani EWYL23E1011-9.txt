5/1/24, 1:53 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
5/1/24, 1:54 PM - Saloni Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
5/1/24, 1:56 PM - +260 96 7889730: It’s a good objective
5/1/24, 1:56 PM - +260 779684925: Thank you for the information

27/1/24, 8:45 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Good day!
I hope you're doing well.

I know from the past few days, that I could not respond but allow me to share a story very close to my heart🫰🏻

I became a part of Edoofa almost two years back with initial thoughts on how my relationship would be, will I be a good mentor, or will I be able to think like my students, and so on. With these thoughts, I began my journey. Honestly speaking, I learned a lot each day, and yes, made some mistakes but I did not know that now there is going something that I will cherish for my lifetime, our bond. In this journey so far, I have guided more than 500 students, and beyond guidance I have made sure that I can create a transformation in their lives🌟
27/1/24, 8:45 PM - Saloni Edoofa: As an individual, I always believe that the learning process is life never ends and the more you learn, the better the guidance becomes, with a heavy heart, *I've chosen to immerse myself in higher education, and as a result, I'll be taking a step back from being your mentor🥺*
*You have a special place in my heart, and I am profoundly thankful for the honor of being your mentor*. Our journey doesn't end here; it merely takes a different course. I have full confidence in your continued success.

*I want to assure you that the Mentorship team will reach out to you soon to discuss the upcoming plan and ensure a seamless transition.*
All the best🫶🏻

7/2/24, 10:59 AM - Saloni Edoofa: Good morning, @260967889730 !

I'm Ms. Tushti from the Academic Board of Edoofa, and I see that you're quite worried about your child's EWYL journey.

I understand your concern as a parent and appreciate your involvement in your daughter's higher education. I'm sure you're aware of Ms. Saloni's decision to pursue her higher education, and we as a team respect and appreciate her choice. However, I want to assure you that our mentorship team will soon get in touch with you to provide a new mentor for Zhylani.

Currently, our entire team is occupied with the Africa Visit. Planning such a huge event from a distance is indeed hectic and tedious. So, we're currently packed with preparations, but don't worry, we will resume your sessions after the Africa trip. In the meantime, if you face any challenges, you can always connect with me here in your EWYL group, and I'll be assisting you personally.
7/2/24, 10:59 AM - Saloni Edoofa: Also, I noticed that you asked something about seat reservations. Can you please help me understand your concern a bit better?
7/2/24, 11:02 AM - +260 96 7889730: They huge challenge we are facing is lapses in communication however ms saloni would have informed us about her exit.
We have taken note
7/2/24, 8:36 PM - +260 96 4841330: Thanks
7/2/24, 8:46 PM - +260 96 4841330: I have a question ms Tushti when is the same African trip ending so we can know
8/2/24, 7:50 AM - Saloni Edoofa: Good morning, Zhylani. I would like to inform you that while Ms Saloni has stepped down from her role as your mentor, the Team is actively searching for a suitable mentor to guide you through your journey. I urge you to be patient. Meanwhile, do not hesitate to share your progress with the projects with me. Also let me know of any challenges you might be facing that you need help with.

Hope you are well.

I'm happy to share that our team just got back from an incredible event in Zimbabwe, and let me tell you, this time our Meet & Greet event was bigger and better! It was an amazing three-day event! 🎉

This time, it wasn't just Mr. Angad who went, but our whole admissions team, counseling team, and the program director joined in too!

Students and parents alike had the exclusive opportunity to dive deep into the exciting journey that awaits them in India. And guess what? Mr. Angad himself talked about exciting employment opportunities for everyone in India along with the EWYL plan. We also organized a special scholarship test for students who aren't part of the Edoofian community yet.
