26/12/23, 10:28 AM - Saloni Edoofa: Coming to this, may I know if you were able to form the group?
26/12/23, 10:29 AM - +263 78 019 2260: Not yet

26/12/23, 10:33 AM - Saloni Edoofa: That is great, may I know if you are clear with the process?
26/12/23, 10:34 AM - +263 78 019 2260: Yes the process is clear to me
26/12/23, 10:36 AM - Saloni Edoofa: You can physically visit schools and reach out to students, where you can share information about Edoofa:
26/12/23, 10:36 AM - Saloni Edoofa: *Introduction to Edoofa*:

*Transformational Impact*:
Highlight how Edoofa can transform their lives and open doors to exciting opportunities.
Physically visiting schools adds a personal touch to text messages, allowing for on-the-spot clarification of doubts. You can directly encourage them to fill out the student application form instantly.
26/12/23, 10:37 AM - +263 78 019 2260: Yaah that was my plan but Currently the schools are closed so will go there when they open
26/12/23, 10:41 AM - Saloni Edoofa: Sure that is alright!
26/12/23, 10:41 AM - Saloni Edoofa: One-on-one conversations have altogether different impact. It has a lot of impact on their perspective of Edoofa. Once you approach any individual, you must talk about these few things with them:
26/12/23, 10:42 AM - Saloni Edoofa: 1. Introduce yourself as a student ambassador of Edoofa, and tell about what were your initial thoughts about Edoofa and how this process started. Talk about how you started with the counseling process, clarifying your doubts with your dedicated counselor, choosing the right course, how Inia can be the right destination, and then finally passing the eligibility tests. 
2. Then tell me about starting with your Admission process who will help you in choosing the right University, documentation work, Visa process, travel arrangements, getting the offer letter from the Universities, and many more.
3. Then tell them about the EWYL Program. Through this scholarship Program, they have already reduced their University fees, and through this program, they can reduce their University fees partially or fully. Tell them about how they can upskill themselves through weekly lessons, activities, and newsletters, and how they can earn virtual scholarship credits that can be adjusted in their University fees.
4. Then share them about the Department of Student Welfare. This is a specialized Department that we have created to cater to the needs and requirements of our Indian Edoofians. Unlike any agent who abandons them, our specialized department helps them with the registration process, accommodation, and other administrative process.
26/12/23, 10:44 AM - +263 78 019 2260: One on one interaction is actually powerful because you would be able to convince the person more quickly and easily
26/12/23, 10:48 AM - Saloni Edoofa: Yes, did you have a chance to do so?
26/12/23, 10:49 AM - +263 78 019 2260: I'm waiting for schools to open so that I will go there and look for students
26/12/23, 10:54 AM - Saloni Edoofa: Okay, but meanwhile did you take to your friends and neighbours?
26/12/23, 10:58 AM - +263 78 019 2260: Currently in my home area there are no A level students nor higher O level students .
There are only primary students and many who are in form 1
26/12/23, 11:03 AM - Saloni Edoofa: As we wrap up today's session, I'm eager to reconnect with you tomorrow during our EWYL Group meeting from 10:00-11:00 AM! 🌟 Anticipate another engaging and fruitful session. I'm excited about what we'll achieve together. See you there

26/12/23, 11:06 AM - +263 78 019 2260: But I will try to look in my nearby towns

Honestly, some targets seemed achievable, but I always kept a few that made me thrive beyond my boundaries to achieve that.

I am genuinely excited to _hear about your New Year celebrations and any resolutions you've set for yourself_. Whether they involve personal growth, academic achievements, or new experiences, I am eager to support and celebrate your journey throughout the year🎯.

2/1/24, 10:38 AM - +263 78 019 2260: So what should I name the group
2/1/24, 10:40 AM - Saloni Edoofa: *Ethan/Saloni/2JAN2024*
2/1/24, 10:49 AM - +263 78 019 2260: OK it's fine

2/1/24, 10:59 AM - Saloni Edoofa: That is amazing Ethan!
2/1/24, 10:59 AM - Saloni Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
2/1/24, 10:59 AM - +263 78 019 2260: So I'm now looking for more people to join the group
2/1/24, 10:59 AM - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>

I am Ethan's father. My apologies for Ethan not being present on the WhatsApp platform, he has travelled to go and collect his  results slip.
18/1/24, 3:30 PM - Saloni Edoofa: That is alright, I can understand that.
18/1/24, 6:41 PM - +263 77 267 1786: And also our network where we stay is not perfect these days..kindly bear with our eratic communication.
19/1/24, 10:02 AM - Saloni Edoofa: Good day, everyone!
How are you doing?

May we begin with our session?
19/1/24, 11:06 AM - Saloni Edoofa: Our sessions will resume next week, from *Tuesday* onwards, between *10:00 - 11:00 AM*. Unfortunately, due to some family commitments on Monday, I'll be occupied, and our session may not occur. However, I want you to go through everything that we have discussed so far in this time.

Just so you know, there will be no sessions held on Saturday and Sunday, allowing for a well-deserved break.

Wishing you a fantastic weekend ahead filled with joy and relaxation! 🌺
27/1/24, 7:45 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Good day!
I hope you're doing well.

I know from the past few days, that I could not respond but allow me to share a story very close to my heart🫰🏻

I became a part of Edoofa almost two years back with initial thoughts on how my relationship would be, will I be a good mentor, or will I be able to think like my students, and so on. With these thoughts, I began my journey. Honestly speaking, I learned a lot each day, and yes, made some mistakes but I did not know that now there is going something that I will cherish for my lifetime, our bond. In this journey so far, I have guided more than 500 students, and beyond guidance I have made sure that I can create a transformation in their lives🌟
27/1/24, 7:45 PM - Saloni Edoofa: As an individual, I always believe that the learning process is life never ends and the more you learn, the better the guidance becomes, with a heavy heart, *I've chosen to immerse myself in higher education, and as a result, I'll be taking a step back from being your mentor🥺*
*You have a special place in my heart, and I am profoundly thankful for the honor of being your mentor*. Our journey doesn't end here; it merely takes a different course. I have full confidence in your continued success.

*I want to assure you that the Mentorship team will reach out to you soon to discuss the upcoming plan and ensure a seamless transition.*
All the best🫶🏻

7/2/24, 11:20 AM - Saloni Edoofa: Hello, Ethan!

I have been expecting to hear from you for the past couple of days, but I can see you have not been able to get back to me due to certain reasons I am not aware of. You see, I had really been looking forward to having you at the event as I know how beneficial it is going to be for you.

While we were having multiple conversations with our students in the past few days for the meet & greet event, we figured that there is a slight confusion in the invitation dates. Hence, I wanted to quickly reach out and ensure that the same is not the case with you.

- As per the invitation, *you* are supposed to attend the event along with your parents on *19th of February* which is Monday.
 
- If you are recommending any of *your friends (Non Edoofians)* along with their parents to attend the event, as per their choice, the seminar is scheduled for *18th of February (8am/1pm) or 19th February(1pm)*. They should carry a physical copy of their admit cards to enter the event.
17/2/24, 10:47 AM - Saloni Edoofa: Please ensure that you are present at the venue 30 minutes earlier and are dressed appropriately.
Don't forget to carry your admit card!
