26/12/23, 1:56 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: I am delighted to share that EDOOFA's scholarship program is currently benefiting over 100 schools in Africa, with more than 3,000 African students already reaping its rewards. School principals and teachers who play a significant role in our program enjoy exclusive access to part-time Ph.D. programs. Additionally, EDOOFA's Earn While You Learn Program helps students reduce the financial burden of food and accommodation by providing opportunities to learn new skills and earn scholarship credits.
26/12/23, 1:59 PM - +263 78 411 9566: Okay understood
26/12/23, 2:01 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: In Zimbabwe alone, EDOOFA has enrolled more than 1,500 students in the program within the last year. Collaborating with over 100 schools, including partnerships with esteemed educational leaders such as Mr. Shorwi Kawadza, Principal of Hartzell High School, Mutare, EDOOFA has witnessed the success of more than 80 students who have already embarked on their journey to study in India.
26/12/23, 2:05 PM - +263 78 411 9566: Wow that sounds amazing
26/12/23, 2:07 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Along with this, schools can benefit in the following ways:

1. Free Educational Counseling for Parents of ‘A-Level’/SHS Students looking to Study Abroad.
2. Quality Career Guidance Program for Learners to become eligible for 50-100 percent Scholarship on Tuition Fees in Degree Programs in Top Indian Universities.
3. Opportunities for Collaboration for implementing the best practices of the Indian Education System in progressive African Schools.
4. Facilitating your school-nominated teachers/academicians who have accomplished a Master's degree and want to pursue a higher academic qualification(Ph.D.)(Part-Time) on a 50-100 percent Scholarship.
26/12/23, 2:10 PM - +263 78 411 9566: Okay noted

26/12/23, 2:14 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: When the school’s per-term fees are less than $100, we do not get a school call done by Edoofa's Program Director.
26/12/23, 2:17 PM - +263 78 411 9566: Understood
26/12/23, 2:18 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: The reason behind this is that there is very much doubt that the students from this school will or will not be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education.
So in such a case, we insist that students form a WhatsApp where they add me, Mr. Jyotishman, Ms. Deepali, Mr. Abhinav, and the Headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact from that school. After forming the group they:
26/12/23, 2:18 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: 1) Either ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to specifically add those prospective students who will be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education. After they add, then tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
or
2) Ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to share those prospective students' contact details with you, so that you can add them and then educate them about Edoofa. After that, tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
26/12/23, 2:19 PM - +263 78 411 9566: Okay noted

26/12/23, 2:24 PM - +263 78 411 9566: Okay so we were talking about the benefits schools provide like, carrier guidance and educational cancelling for parents. And we were also talking about filling information so that the program director of Edoofa can contact me

26/12/23, 2:40 PM - +263 78 411 9566: Okay

26/12/23, 3:22 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: FIFTH- Every day you have to come and say "I am a proud EDOOFIAN' on the EWYL line.
26/12/23, 10:18 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: It serves as a link between every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. It fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that most of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.
26/12/23, 10:19 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Goodnight dear
27/12/23, 2:03 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Afternoon Takunda
I hope you are doing good. 

Finally the day has come where you will learn new skill, yes it is time to collect your _*WEDNESDAY WISDOM*_

I hope you are doing well.

Tomorrow, I'll be occupied organizing an industrial visit for our students here in India, and as a result, there won't be a session. I really appreciate your understanding.

*Now, I will meet you in our next session*
Have a great evening!
6/1/24, 4:03 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: _*Good Afternoon my lovely student*_
I wanted to share some exciting news with you. As you may have noticed, my schedule has been quite packed lately due to work commitments. The reason behind this is something truly special – our team has organized a three-day long industrial visit called *SLICE CON' 24* for our Indian Edoofians! 🚀

During this event, *we are fortunate to have the Co-founders and CEOs of prominent brands* who will be present and sharing their invaluable *experiences in one-on-one sessions.* Yes, you read that right – they will be there live, right in front of us! What's even more thrilling is that a few of our students are presenting a presentation directly to these CEOs, showcasing why Africa, your homeland, is the best market for their products. 🤝
6/1/24, 4:03 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: While I am filled with excitement for this event, please note that due to my involvement in the visit on the *8th, 9th, and 10th of January*, our regular sessions won't be taking place on these days. 

*When we connect on the 11th of January at 7::00 pm,* I'll share my students' experiences and pictures with you. 📸✨

*Now, Since it will be a long break, I want you to work hard on the projects and submit 7 applications to me on Thursday.* 
Give it your 100% and I know you can do this. Take care
15/1/24, 1:11 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: *_Good Afternoon_*
Kindly excuse me for the delay in my response. Following the event, I experienced a fever and had to be on bed rest for a couple of days.

Let me share the scoop on *Slice Con'24—it was seriously awesome!* The event was nothing short of extraordinary, providing students with a wealth of exposure and valuable insights. 🚀
Throughout the event, students actively engaged with CEOs, asking insightful questions and gaining a deeper understanding of various industries. The *AI sessions* were particularly enlightening, offering a glimpse into the cutting-edge advancements in technology and some amazing AI Tools🤖

But wait, there's more! They also played games and made some great memories. It was a total win-win—fun and educational at the same time. Here is a glimpse of how it went, looking forward to when you will also get this chance to be here and experience these amazing things🤩❤️

You know, my dream has always been to embark on a journey of higher studies, aiming to obtain a PhD in chemistry from abroad. *While this means I must bid farewell as your mentor, Believe me, I am doing so with the conviction that the next individual stepping into this role will be of equal or even greater caliber. I trust they will guide you with the same dedication, enabling you to achieve your dreams.*
17/1/24, 9:14 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Congartulations, Takunda
17/1/24, 9:14 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: I have no doubt that you will continue to make me proud, fostering a bond with your new mentor built on honesty and commitment. 

*The mentorship team will be in touch with you to discuss the plan going forward.*

As I pen down this closing message, my heart is filled with gratitude for the journey we've shared. I am confident that the next chapter with your new mentor will be marked by growth, support, and achievements that surpass even our fondest expectations. ❤️

Wishing you all the best on your continued journey, and I look forward to hearing about your future successes.🫱🏼‍🫲🏾

Additionally, for any questions or queries, kindly note that responses will be provided exclusively on EWYL LINE and not on this WhatsApp group.
