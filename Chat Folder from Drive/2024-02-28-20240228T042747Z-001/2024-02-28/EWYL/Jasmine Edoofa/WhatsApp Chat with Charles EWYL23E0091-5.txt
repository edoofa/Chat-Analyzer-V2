6/1/24, 7:37 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: _*Good Afternoon my lovely student*_
I wanted to share some exciting news with you. As you may have noticed, my schedule has been quite packed lately due to work commitments. The reason behind this is something truly special – our team has organized a three-day long industrial visit called *SLICE CON' 24* for our Indian Edoofians! 🚀

During this event, *we are fortunate to have the Co-founders and CEOs of prominent brands* who will be present and sharing their invaluable *experiences in one-on-one sessions.* Yes, you read that right – they will be there live, right in front of us! What's even more thrilling is that a few of our students are presenting a presentation directly to these CEOs, showcasing why Africa, your homeland, is the best market for their products. 🤝
6/1/24, 7:37 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: While I am filled with excitement for this event, please note that due to my involvement in the visit on the *8th, 9th, and 10th of January*, our regular sessions won't be taking place on these days. 

*When we connect on the 12th of January at 7::00 pm,* I'll share my students' experiences and pictures with you. 📸✨

*Now, Since it will be a long break, I want you to work hard on the projects and submit 7 applications to me on Thursday.* 
Give it your 100% and I know you can do this. Take care
15/1/24, 1:24 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: *_Good Afternoon_*
Kindly excuse me for the delay in my response. Following the event, I experienced a fever and had to be on bed rest for a couple of days.

Let me share the scoop on *Slice Con'24—it was seriously awesome!* The event was nothing short of extraordinary, providing students with a wealth of exposure and valuable insights. 🚀
Throughout the event, students actively engaged with CEOs, asking insightful questions and gaining a deeper understanding of various industries. The *AI sessions* were particularly enlightening, offering a glimpse into the cutting-edge advancements in technology and some amazing AI Tools🤖

But wait, there's more! They also played games and made some great memories. It was a total win-win—fun and educational at the same time. Here is a glimpse of how it went, looking forward to when you will also get this chance to be here and experience these amazing things🤩❤️

I trust this message finds you well and that your day has been delightful thus far. 
I hope you recall the times when I encouraged you to pursue your dreams passionately and put in the hard work to see them come to fruition. 🎓

*Today, with a heavy heart yet fortified by courage, I am sharing with you my decision to step back from my role as your mentor.* It is not without sincere consideration, and I want you to know that your growth and success have always been my utmost priority.

You know, my dream has always been to embark on a journey of higher studies, aiming to obtain a PhD in chemistry from abroad. *While this means I must bid farewell as your mentor, Believe me, I am doing so with the conviction that the next individual stepping into this role will be of equal or even greater caliber. I trust they will guide you with the same dedication, enabling you to achieve your dreams.*
17/1/24, 9:57 PM - +263 71 385 1617: How are you ma'am

*The mentorship team will be in touch with you to discuss the plan going forward.*

As I pen down this closing message, my heart is filled with gratitude for the journey we've shared. I am confident that the next chapter with your new mentor will be marked by growth, support, and achievements that surpass even our fondest expectations. ❤️

I hope this message finds you well. In today's Wednesday lesson, we'll delve into the impactful realm of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and computer technology in the context of saving lives. We'll explore how innovative solutions are leveraging these technologies to make a significant difference in healthcare.

Furthermore, we'll discuss a noteworthy case study involving a startup from Zambia that has effectively translated the concept of using AI and computer technology into practical applications for improving healthcare outcomes.

No issues, I understand that your new mentor assigning is still in progress but as we advance I expect you to please make sure that whatever documents or content is shared in the group you through it well and share the learning of the same with me.
1/2/24, 10:04 AM - +263 71 385 1617: I understood I will do like that
1/2/24, 10:04 AM - +263 71 385 1617: I am well and you

1/2/24, 10:14 AM - Sanjana Edoofa: Please type it here

1/2/24, 10:28 AM - +263 71 385 1617: Artificial intelligence or AI is the ability of machines or technology to mimic human intelligence, especially computer systems. So, when your smartphone auto-corrects or an online store sends you advertisements for a new product it thinks you’ll like, you can say thank you to AI.

AI is being used in a wide range of industries and applications, including healthcare, finance, and transportation. Examples in healthcare include; AI is used to analyse medical data and images, and make diagnoses, in finance; AI is being used for fraud detection and financial forecasting, and in transportation; AI is being used in development of self-driving cars and matters such as improving traffic safety.

In healthcare, AI is used more and more to aid in the diagnosis, treatment, and management of disease, including epilepsy. It’s important to note that while AI shows promise in epilepsy management, it is still very much an evolving field, and further research and validation are needed to ensure its accuracy and clinical effectiveness.
1/2/24, 10:39 AM - +263 71 385 1617: AI is already playing a significant role in medical diagnosis, treatment and prognosis. It is going to play a far bigger role in the future. It has the potential to shape diagnosis, prediction, and management of neurological diseases such as epilepsy, and to improve patient engagement and health education and promotion. AI is not intended to replace medical opinion but to transform healthcare into a system where technology and humans can work together to provide an accurate, timely diagnosis, and management of the health condition.
