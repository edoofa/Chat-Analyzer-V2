I hope you are doing well.

Tomorrow, I'll be occupied organizing an industrial visit for our students here in India, and as a result, there won't be a session. I really appreciate your understanding.

*Now, I will meet you in our next session*
Have a great evening!
3/1/24, 6:25 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Well, Done on sharing the form 🌟 
It has been shared with our dedicated counseling team. In the meantime, it is crucial that you maintain regular communication with the student and address any queries they may have. Our counseling team will be reaching out to them directly within the next 15-20 days.
3/1/24, 7:18 PM - +263 78 433 7203: Okay sure
6/1/24, 4:03 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: _*Good Afternoon my lovely student*_
I wanted to share some exciting news with you. As you may have noticed, my schedule has been quite packed lately due to work commitments. The reason behind this is something truly special – our team has organized a three-day long industrial visit called *SLICE CON' 24* for our Indian Edoofians! 🚀

During this event, *we are fortunate to have the Co-founders and CEOs of prominent brands* who will be present and sharing their invaluable *experiences in one-on-one sessions.* Yes, you read that right – they will be there live, right in front of us! What's even more thrilling is that a few of our students are presenting a presentation directly to these CEOs, showcasing why Africa, your homeland, is the best market for their products. 🤝
6/1/24, 4:04 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: While I am filled with excitement for this event, please note that due to my involvement in the visit on the *8th, 9th, and 10th of January*, our regular sessions won't be taking place on these days. 

*When we connect on the 11th of January at 7::00 pm,* I'll share my students' experiences and pictures with you. 📸✨

*Now, Since it will be a long break, I want you to work hard on the projects and submit 7 applications to me on Thursday.* 
Give it your 100% and I know you can do this. Take care
6/1/24, 5:24 PM - +263 78 433 7203: Okay thank you
11/1/24, 4:54 PM - +263 78 433 7203: Good afternoon Ms Jasmine hopefully you had a wonderful time and we can now resume our sessions
13/1/24, 5:54 AM - +263 78 433 7203: Good morning Ms Jasmine
15/1/24, 9:33 AM - +263 78 433 7203: Good day Ms Jasmine hopefully you had a wonderful weekend looking forward to our session today
15/1/24, 1:09 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: *_Good Afternoon_*
Kindly excuse me for the delay in my response. Following the event, I experienced a fever and had to be on bed rest for a couple of days.

Let me share the scoop on *Slice Con'24—it was seriously awesome!* The event was nothing short of extraordinary, providing students with a wealth of exposure and valuable insights. 🚀
Throughout the event, students actively engaged with CEOs, asking insightful questions and gaining a deeper understanding of various industries. The *AI sessions* were particularly enlightening, offering a glimpse into the cutting-edge advancements in technology and some amazing AI Tools🤖

But wait, there's more! They also played games and made some great memories. It was a total win-win—fun and educational at the same time. Here is a glimpse of how it went, looking forward to when you will also get this chance to be here and experience these amazing things🤩❤️

I trust they will guide you with the same dedication, enabling you to achieve your dreams.*

Wishing you all the best on your continued journey, and I look forward to hearing about your future successes.🫱🏼‍🫲🏾
