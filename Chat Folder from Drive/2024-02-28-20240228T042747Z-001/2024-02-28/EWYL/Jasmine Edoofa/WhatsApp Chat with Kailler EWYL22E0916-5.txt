6/1/24, 1:43 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: _*Good Afternoon my lovely student*_
I wanted to share some exciting news with you. As you may have noticed, my schedule has been quite packed lately due to work commitments. The reason behind this is something truly special – our team has organized a three-day long industrial visit called *SLICE CON' 24* for our Indian Edoofians! 🚀

During this event, *we are fortunate to have the Co-founders and CEOs of prominent brands* who will be present and sharing their invaluable *experiences in one-on-one sessions.* Yes, you read that right – they will be there live, right in front of us! What's even more thrilling is that a few of our students are presenting a presentation directly to these CEOs, showcasing why Africa, your homeland, is the best market for their products. 🤝
6/1/24, 1:45 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: While I am filled with excitement for this event, please note that due to my involvement in the visit on the *8th, 9th, and 10th of January*, our regular sessions won't be taking place on these days. 

*When we connect on the 11th of January at 7::00 pm,* I'll share my students' experiences and pictures with you. 📸✨

*Now, Since it will be a long break, I want you to work hard on the projects and submit 7 applications to me on Thursday.* 
Give it your 100% and I know you can do this. Take care <This message was edited>

Kindly excuse me for the delay in my response. Following the event, I experienced a fever and had to be on bed rest for a couple of days.

Let me share the scoop on *Slice Con'24—it was seriously awesome!* The event was nothing short of extraordinary, providing students with a wealth of exposure and valuable insights. 🚀
Throughout the event, students actively engaged with CEOs, asking insightful questions and gaining a deeper understanding of various industries. The *AI sessions* were particularly enlightening, offering a glimpse into the cutting-edge advancements in technology and some amazing AI Tools🤖

But wait, there's more! They also played games and made some great memories. It was a total win-win—fun and educational at the same time. Here is a glimpse of how it went, looking forward to when you will also get this chance to be here and experience these amazing things🤩❤️

You know, my dream has always been to embark on a journey of higher studies, aiming to obtain a PhD in chemistry from abroad. *While this means I must bid farewell as your mentor, Believe me, I am doing so with the conviction that the next individual stepping into this role will be of equal or even greater caliber. I trust they will guide you with the same dedication, enabling you to achieve your dreams.*
17/1/24, 2:51 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: I have no doubt that you will continue to make me proud, fostering a bond with your new mentor built on honesty and commitment.
