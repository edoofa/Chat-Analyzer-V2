28/12/23, 2:13 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: I am delighted to share that EDOOFA's scholarship program is currently benefiting over 100 schools in Africa, with more than 3,000 African students already reaping its rewards. School principals and teachers who play a significant role in our program enjoy exclusive access to part-time Ph.D. programs.

28/12/23, 2:16 PM - +263 78 155 6299: That's nice
28/12/23, 2:18 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Along with this, schools can benefit in the following ways:

28/12/23, 3:01 PM - +263 78 155 6299: Ok
28/12/23, 3:03 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: When the school’s per-term fees are less than $100, we do not get a school call done by Edoofa's Program Director.
28/12/23, 3:03 PM - +263 78 155 6299: Ok
28/12/23, 3:08 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: The reason behind this is that there is very much doubt that the students from this school will or will not be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education.
So in such a case, we insist that students form a WhatsApp where they add me, Mr. Jyotishman, Ms. Deepali, Mr. Abhinav, and the Headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact from that school. After forming the group they:
28/12/23, 3:08 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: 1) Either ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to specifically add those prospective students who will be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education. After they add, then tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
or
2) Ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to share those prospective students' contact details with you, so that you can add them and then educate them about Edoofa. After that, tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them

28/12/23, 3:11 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, Moregrace- we’ve come to the end of one part of your onboarding of EWYL. So, I want you to go through this conversation quickly- and highlight any areas, questions, or projects that you may have even the slightest concern with- and let’s resolve them before we move on!
28/12/23, 3:34 PM - +263 78 155 6299: Ok Ma'am
28/12/23, 3:34 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Great, So now we are ready to begin our new journey
Please note a few things:
FIRST- From now onwards, you will have your sessions on

28/12/23, 4:11 PM - +263 78 155 6299: Ok
28/12/23, 8:32 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: It serves as a link between every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. It fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that most of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.
28/12/23, 8:32 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Now you can text on the Line and I will get back to you there in a while.

29/12/23, 1:38 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: _*Good Afternoon Moregrace*_
Let us start today's session with a fun question -

If you could create a new country on any unclaimed land in the world, what would you name it, and what values or principles would be the foundation of your utopian society?
29/12/23, 1:44 PM - +263 78 155 6299: That's a fun question! Let's imagine I could create a new country on some unclaimed land. I think I would name it "Solara," which means "sun" in Latin. The values and principles of this society would be based on sustainability, equality, and respect for nature. The society would be focused on living in harmony with the environment and ensuring that all people have access to the resources they need to live a fulfilling life. The people of Solara would value peace, cooperation, and collaboration. Does that sound like a place you'd like to live? 😊
29/12/23, 2:03 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Solara sounds like a wonderfully thought-out and inspiring utopian vision! The emphasis on sustainability, equality, and respect for nature reflects a deep awareness of the interconnectedness between society and the environment. It's particularly commendable that your vision prioritizes access to resources for all, promoting a sense of shared prosperity and well-being. Good job, Moregrace
29/12/23, 2:04 PM - +263 78 155 6299: Thank you
29/12/23, 2:36 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Have you messaged on the EWYL LINE?
29/12/23, 3:14 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Now it is time to wrap up the session. As we are going to embark on a new chapter at the dawn of the New Year, I really wanted to send my warmest wishes your way. 
_May this coming year be filled with joy, laughter, and moments of profound happiness_ 🌈

Along with you, the Edoofa Family will also be occupied in *New Year Celebrations from tomorrow till 1 January 2024* and we will *resume from 2 January onwards*🎉

Wishing you a year ahead filled with love, prosperity, and the fulfillment of your heart's desires. May every day be a chance for you to shine and make a positive impact. ✨

Happy New Year in advance! 🎊

6/1/24, 4:03 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: _*Good Afternoon my lovely student*_
I wanted to share some exciting news with you. As you may have noticed, my schedule has been quite packed lately due to work commitments. The reason behind this is something truly special – our team has organized a three-day long industrial visit called *SLICE CON' 24* for our Indian Edoofians! 🚀

During this event, *we are fortunate to have the Co-founders and CEOs of prominent brands* who will be present and sharing their invaluable *experiences in one-on-one sessions.* Yes, you read that right – they will be there live, right in front of us! What's even more thrilling is that a few of our students are presenting a presentation directly to these CEOs, showcasing why Africa, your homeland, is the best market for their products. 🤝
6/1/24, 4:04 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: While I am filled with excitement for this event, please note that due to my involvement in the visit on the *8th, 9th, and 10th of January*, our regular sessions won't be taking place on these days. 

*When we connect on the 11th of January at 7::00 pm,* I'll share my students' experiences and pictures with you. 📸✨

*Now, Since it will be a long break, I want you to work hard on the projects and submit 7 applications to me on Thursday.* 
Give it your 100% and I know you can do this. Take care
6/1/24, 4:10 PM - +263 78 155 6299: Ok Ma'am.
15/1/24, 1:11 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: *_Good Afternoon_*
Kindly excuse me for the delay in my response. Following the event, I experienced a fever and had to be on bed rest for a couple of days.

Let me share the scoop on *Slice Con'24—it was seriously awesome!* The event was nothing short of extraordinary, providing students with a wealth of exposure and valuable insights. 🚀
Throughout the event, students actively engaged with CEOs, asking insightful questions and gaining a deeper understanding of various industries. The *AI sessions* were particularly enlightening, offering a glimpse into the cutting-edge advancements in technology and some amazing AI Tools🤖

But wait, there's more! They also played games and made some great memories. It was a total win-win—fun and educational at the same time. Here is a glimpse of how it went, looking forward to when you will also get this chance to be here and experience these amazing things🤩❤️
15/1/24, 1:12 PM - +263 78 155 6299: That's great

I trust this message finds you well and that your day has been delightful thus far. 
I hope you recall the times when I encouraged you to pursue your dreams passionately and put in the hard work to see them come to fruition. 🎓

*Today, with a heavy heart yet fortified by courage, I am sharing with you my decision to step back from my role as your mentor.* It is not without sincere consideration, and I want you to know that your growth and success have always been my utmost priority.

You know, my dream has always been to embark on a journey of higher studies, aiming to obtain a PhD in chemistry from abroad. *While this means I must bid farewell as your mentor, Believe me, I am doing so with the conviction that the next individual stepping into this role will be of equal or even greater caliber. I trust they will guide you with the same dedication, enabling you to achieve your dreams.*
17/1/24, 9:14 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: I have no doubt that you will continue to make me proud, fostering a bond with your new mentor built on honesty and commitment. 

*The mentorship team will be in touch with you to discuss the plan going forward.*

As I pen down this closing message, my heart is filled with gratitude for the journey we've shared. I am confident that the next chapter with your new mentor will be marked by growth, support, and achievements that surpass even our fondest expectations. ❤️

Wishing you all the best on your continued journey, and I look forward to hearing about your future successes.🫱🏼‍🫲🏾

While we were having multiple conversations with our students in the past few days for the meet & greet event, we figured that there is a slight confusion in the invitation dates. Hence, I wanted to quickly reach out and ensure that the same is not the case with you.

- As per the invitation, *you* are supposed to attend the event along with your parents on *19th of February* which is Monday.
 
- If you are recommending any of *your friends (Non Edoofians)* along with their parents to attend the event, as per their choice, the seminar is scheduled for *18th of February (8am/1pm) or 19th February(1pm)*. They should carry a physical copy of their admit cards to enter the event.
17/2/24, 10:43 AM - Jasmine Edoofa: Please ensure that you are present at the venue 30 minutes earlier and are dressed appropriately.
Don't forget to carry your admit card!

Cannot wait to see you there on Monday! Hope you're excited too! 😃🕺🏻
17/2/24, 3:26 PM - +263 78 155 6299: Thank you for the update however I was already on my way to Harare is it possible that I attend tomorrow's event instead of Monday, because on Monday my parents and I have a tight schedule.
26/2/24, 8:56 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Good day!

I can feel your excitement buzzing through the screen as you await your *ESAT results*! Hold onto that anticipation just a bit longer because we're about to drop the big news in sometime! 🎉
