6/1/24, 1:36 PM - Sharda Edoofa: Good day Munashe
I wanted to share some exciting news with all of you. As you may have noticed, my schedule has been quite packed lately due to work commitments. The reason behind this is something truly special – our team has organized a three-day long industrial visit called *SLICE CON' 24* for our Indian Edoofians! 🚀

During this event, *we are fortunate to have the Co-founders and CEOs of prominent brands* who will be present and sharing their invaluable *experiences in one-on-one sessions.* Yes, you read that right – they will be there live, right in front of us! What's even more thrilling is that a few of our students are presenting a presentation directly to these CEOs, showcasing why Africa, your homeland, is the best market for their products. 🤝
6/1/24, 1:40 PM - Sharda Edoofa: While I am filled with excitement for this event, please note that due to my involvement in the visit on the *8th, 9th, and 10th of January*, our regular sessions won't be taking place on these days. When we connect on the 11th of January, I'll share my students' experiences and pictures with you. 📸✨
15/1/24, 10:45 AM - Sharda Edoofa: kindly excuse the basic confusion - *the session is scheduled with you at the usual time which is from 12:00PM.* Please be available at the scheduled time.
15/1/24, 10:46 AM - +263 78 530 5332: Okay noted
15/1/24, 12:45 PM - +263 78 530 5332: <Media omitted>

27/1/24, 8:57 AM - Sharda Edoofa: *Greetings of the day, Munashe*
I hope this message finds you in good spirits. I want to share some heartfelt news with you. After careful consideration, I've come to a decision that carries a mix of emotions. *I've chosen to immerse myself in higher education, and as a result, I'll be taking a step back from being your mentor.*

As we journey through this moment, I can't help but feel a mix of emotions realizing that our daily interactions are about to change. *Saying goodbye to our current way of connecting brings a bittersweet feeling*, but deep down, I see change as a chance for growth and the discovery of new opportunities.

Reflecting on our shared journey, I am truly humbled by the extraordinary moments we've experienced together—the bonds we've forged, the shared laughter, and the countless instances of mutual growth and learning.
27/1/24, 8:59 AM - Sharda Edoofa: *You have a special place in my heart, and I am profoundly thankful for the honor of being your mentor*. Our journey doesn't end here; it merely takes a different course. I have full confidence in your continued success.

Thank you for being an integral part of my life's journey. Keep radiating brilliance, dare to dream ambitiously, and always remember the remarkable potential within you. 
*I want to assure you that the mentorship team will reach out to you soon to discuss the upcoming plan and ensure a seamless transition.*

Hope you are well.

I believe you're ready to commence the training session for being the Coordinator at the Meet and Greet that is just a few days from now!✨
*Let's catch up later today for a call at 2:30 PM to discuss the event details* and ensure it becomes an unforgettable experience, making your contribution stand out in the memory of all of Africa. 🌍🚀

I wish you good luck ahead. Way to go, my Proud Edoofian!!
31/1/24, 2:00 PM - +263 78 530 5332: Good afternoon ma'am and yes thank you for the information
31/1/24, 3:11 PM - +263 78 530 5332: Greetings ma'am yes ma'am i attended the training session for today and I learnt from Ms. Tushti that we are all part of the edoofa organising team now that we have been selected to be representives of Edoofa family. She also posted a task to us that we are to self analyse ourselves so that we see our strengths and weaknesses and we choose the roles we believe are best suited to us for this event. Well ma'am I for one believe I'm so good at connecting with people from different parts of the country and world in general since I'm patient and slow to anger . I'm adaptive to many tasks assigned to me that is i can uptake any task be it video filming or any other task but I would be at best if I'm to be an usher at the event. I also learnt that apart from making this event worth it we don't have to be so strict about perfection and should not worry about failure because it will be part of learning. This further increased my enthusiasm for up taking my part at the event. Furthermore, I'm going to be accompanied by my friends and cousins who are also eager to learn more about the Edoofa scholarship program.This is my feedback from today's session ma'am. Thank you <This message was edited>

1/2/24, 9:52 AM - +263 78 530 5332: Yes i did attend the meeting yesterday and in the webinar the presenter was presenting on the usefulness of AI(artificial intelligence) in the today's livelihood and how it has impacted the job market. In context he spoke of chat GPT and how it has assisted and is continuously assisting students as well as working class people of the society to carry out their tasks such as writing essays. However he also pointed out the flaws of the same AI too that it is not always accurate as sometimes it can have biased information. In case of using facts ,he suggested students and people consider using the AI tool called perplexity. Furthermore,he pointed out the jobs that are on the line of becoming redundant prior to AI. Examples of such jobs involve jobs which are centrally based on calculations, repeated tasks ETC. Afterwards,he shed more light on upcoming jobs which are emerging as a result of AI such as prompt engineering, AI coach, etc. He advised that students be well versed with the use of AI tools so that in the future they are not made redundant in their fields of work due to AI.
1/2/24, 9:54 AM - Sanjana Edoofa: That's wonderful! Would you like to attend more such webinars in the future?

17/2/24, 10:56 AM - Sharda Edoofa: Good Morning Munashe!

While we were having multiple conversations with our students in the past few days for the meet & greet event, we figured that there is a slight confusion in the invitation dates. Hence, I wanted to quickly reach out and ensure that the same is not the case with you.

- As per the invitation, *you* are supposed to attend the event along with your parents on *19th of February* which is Monday.
 
- If you are recommending any of *your friends (Non Edoofians)* along with their parents to attend the event, as per their choice, the seminar is scheduled for *18th of February (8am/1pm) or 19th February(1pm)*. They should carry a physical copy of their admit cards to enter the event.
17/2/24, 10:56 AM - Sharda Edoofa: Please ensure that you are present at the venue 30 minutes earlier and are dressed appropriately.
Don't forget to carry your admit card!

Cannot wait to see you there on Monday! Hope you're excited too! 😃🕺🏻 <This message was edited>

21/2/24, 9:48 AM - Sharda Edoofa: Hello, Munashe
21/2/24, 9:48 AM - Sharda Edoofa: Did you manage to attend the event?
21/2/24, 10:18 AM - +263 78 530 5332: Yes ma'am i did and I was a coordinator too ma'am
21/2/24, 10:18 AM - Sharda Edoofa: The past three days flew by in a whirlwind for Team Edoofa – both for those in India and those in Harare for the Meet and Greet '24. Now that we've had a chance to catch our breath, I want to extend my sincere gratitude to you for being a part of the event and contributing to its success.

Your insights from the event are highly valued, and I'm keen to hear about your experience. Would you be open to sharing your thoughts, including your interest in attending similar events in the future and any suggestions for improvement? Additionally, if you have captured any memorable moments in photos, we would greatly appreciate you sharing them.

Your perspective is crucial, and I also encourage you to discuss the event with your parents and gather their feedback.
21/2/24, 10:18 AM - Sharda Edoofa: I would also like to know your experience as an event coordinator
21/2/24, 10:19 AM - +263 78 530 5332: Okay ma'am
21/2/24, 10:19 AM - Sharda Edoofa: Would you like to manage and organize more such events?
21/2/24, 10:19 AM - +263 78 530 5332: Okay ma'am
21/2/24, 10:19 AM - +263 78 530 5332: Definately yes ma'am <This message was edited>
21/2/24, 10:31 AM - +263 78 530 5332: The past three days have been breathtaking days as i was an event coordinator at the meet and greet session (slice-con24). Preparations for the event started on the day before the first day and I couldn't attend as i was traveling to Harare. I therefore couldn't acquire the Edoofa t-shirt for myself. The first day of the event (17th of February) was great but I couldn't serve as much as the others did as i didn't have the Edoofa t-shirt so it was hard to identify me as one of the coordinators. I attended the second day too without the t-shirt again but it was better since i was well versed with my coordinating team members and at the end of the day we received our Tshirts. The last day was a blast as i was fully engaged in the event since I had my t-shirt too everyone could recognise me as one of the event coordinators and I fully served my role. I also managed to bring three of my friends to the event to sit for the ESAT exam. I also sat for the exam on the 19th of February. The exam was tricky but I managed to answer all questions and I'm hoping for the best too. And yes this meet and greet session was informative and it shed more light on information i wasn't so sure about. It was helpful. I also got to connect with some of the edoofa team members on a more personal level such as Ms. Deepali and others. This got me feeling as part of the family at large. Apart from that i got to expand my network magnitude with my colleagues and learning from their journeys too as proud edoofians . I also got to make friends with Edoofians who are going to study at the same university i was given before even studying there in India itself. Also I got to get a more detailed insight about the lifestyle as an edoofian in India from one of the student who came to the event who was previously enrolled by the Edoofa program. I am looking forward to more of these events and to be part of the coordinating teams aswell. Thank you
21/2/24, 10:32 AM - Sharda Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that the event was fruitful for you!
21/2/24, 10:32 AM - Sharda Edoofa: We look forward to seeing you take the lead in more such events once you are in India
21/2/24, 10:32 AM - +263 78 530 5332: Yes ma'am it really was
21/2/24, 10:33 AM - +263 78 530 5332: I hope for the same too ma'am
21/2/24, 10:33 AM - Sharda Edoofa: Do share any pictures you might have taken!
21/2/24, 10:33 AM - +263 78 530 5332: Well ma'am I did not take many pictures with the Edoofa team

26/2/24, 10:47 AM - Sharda Edoofa: I'd like to know how your Community Building Project is coming along?
26/2/24, 10:49 AM - +263 78 530 5332: Well ma'am on the community building project i had shared a form with you in this group since I don't have a mentor currently therefore didn't consider sharing it on the dedicated line but i did not receive feedback from you please
26/2/24, 10:49 AM - +263 78 530 5332: This one please
26/2/24, 10:50 AM - Sharda Edoofa: Oh, it seems like the form was missed. Let me share it with the Counselling Team right away!

26/2/24, 10:52 AM - +263 78 530 5332: That said ma'am i would like to let you know that I'm working hard on enrolling more students ma'am through the community building project please
26/2/24, 10:54 AM - Sharda Edoofa: I have doubt as to your diligence, Munashe. In fact, after having received feedback from the team s to how well you worked as a coordinator, my expectations from you have gone up tremendously
26/2/24, 10:55 AM - +263 78 530 5332: Thank you ma'am and i also believe you had a typo and  you meant you don't have any doubts in the first part 🥲
26/2/24, 10:56 AM - Sharda Edoofa: My apologies, it is a typo indeed!
26/2/24, 10:57 AM - +263 78 530 5332: It's okay ma'am
26/2/24, 10:59 AM - +263 78 530 5332: Also ma'am please confirm that the ESAT exam results are coming out today right?
26/2/24, 10:59 AM - +263 78 530 5332: My friends were asking
26/2/24, 11:00 AM - Sharda Edoofa: I believe so, Munashe. But due to high volume of answer sheets, there very possibly could be a delay of a day or two <This message was edited>
26/2/24, 11:03 AM - +263 78 530 5332: Okay ma'am thank you for the confirmation please
26/2/24, 11:03 AM - Sharda Edoofa: You are most welcome
