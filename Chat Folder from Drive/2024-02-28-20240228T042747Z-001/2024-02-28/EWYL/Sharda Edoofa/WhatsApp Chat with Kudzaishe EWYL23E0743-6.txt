6/1/24, 1:45 PM - Sharda Edoofa: Good day Kudzaishe
I wanted to share some exciting news with all of you. As you may have noticed, my schedule has been quite packed lately due to work commitments. The reason behind this is something truly special – our team has organized a three-day long industrial visit called *SLICE CON' 24* for our Indian Edoofians! 🚀

During this event, *we are fortunate to have the Co-founders and CEOs of prominent brands* who will be present and sharing their invaluable *experiences in one-on-one sessions.* Yes, you read that right – they will be there live, right in front of us! What's even more thrilling is that a few of our students are presenting a presentation directly to these CEOs, showcasing why Africa, your homeland, is the best market for their products. 🤝
6/1/24, 1:51 PM - Sharda Edoofa: While I am filled with excitement for this event, please note that due to my involvement in the visit on the *8th, 9th, and 10th of January*, our regular sessions won't be taking place on these days. When we connect on the 11th of January, I'll share my students' experiences and pictures with you. 📸✨

I hope this message finds you in good spirits. I want to share some heartfelt news with you. After careful consideration, I've come to a decision that carries a mix of emotions. *I've chosen to immerse myself in higher education, and as a result, I'll be taking a step back from being your mentor.*

As we journey through this moment, I can't help but feel a mix of emotions realizing that our daily interactions are about to change. *Saying goodbye to our current way of connecting brings a bittersweet feeling*, but deep down, I see change as a chance for growth and the discovery of new opportunities.

Reflecting on our shared journey, I am truly humbled by the extraordinary moments we've experienced together—the bonds we've forged, the shared laughter, and the countless instances of mutual growth and learning.

21/2/24, 9:56 AM - Sharda Edoofa: Hello Kudzaishe!

The past three days flew by in a whirlwind for Team Edoofa – both for those in India and those in Harare for the Meet and Greet '24. Now that we've had a chance to catch our breath, I want to extend my sincere gratitude to you for being a part of the event and contributing to its success.

Your insights from the event are highly valued, and I'm keen to hear about your experience. Would you be open to sharing your thoughts, including your interest in attending similar events in the future and any suggestions for improvement? Additionally, if you have captured any memorable moments in photos, we would greatly appreciate you sharing them.

Your perspective is crucial, and I also encourage you to discuss the event with your parents and gather their feedback.

21/2/24, 6:37 PM - +263 78 683 7236: The Meet and Greet event was a success I spent quality time with other students of Edoofa and the Board that came all the way from India including Mr Angad Singh.
Events like those are healthy to us as students because the presentations that were carried by Mr Angad enlightened me more about Edoofa and as for the parents that were present their doubts got cleared as some were assuming that they were being scammed but now they are sure that Edoofa is real and Edoofa cares about us.

We also watched some clips about the life of Edoofians in India,they seemed extremely happy and they are living large those guys they event presented about how Edoofa has gifted them a chance to study abroad.
21/2/24, 6:42 PM - +263 78 683 7236: The board was really nice to us their are friendly and warm, I even realized the importance of carrying on with my EWYL program as it will help me cover for my tuition, I also wrote my essay exam
21/2/24, 6:46 PM - +263 78 683 7236: I believe attending similar events in the future is a advisable because that's when we get to show case our passion as students, we get to interact with our mentors and other Edoofians, we even get to share different ideas and get to clear our minds a bit
