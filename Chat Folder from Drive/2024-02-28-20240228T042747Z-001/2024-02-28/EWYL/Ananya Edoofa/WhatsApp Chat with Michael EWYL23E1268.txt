26/2/24, 9:07 AM - +263 71 321 1883: So l think its mainly focusing on the selection of a company... So it's saying that it's not about just randomly picking a company but instead the company must be willing to help students and also its background matters
26/2/24, 9:07 AM - Ananya Edoofa: This is fantastic! This is the kind of comprehension needed in an Edoofian, and voila! You are already so good at it.
