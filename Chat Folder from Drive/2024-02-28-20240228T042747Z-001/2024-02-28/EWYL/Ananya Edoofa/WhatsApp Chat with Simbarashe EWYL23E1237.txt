21/2/24, 1:48 PM - +263 78 702 5922: I really did enjoy it, it was an exciting event to be apart of. I would, however, like to suggest maybe next time if you could offer small finger snacks or even water, just to keep up refreshed throughout the event. Other than that, I truly enjoyed, I even had the change to meet a few new people and bumped into some friends from school
21/2/24, 1:49 PM - +263 78 702 5922: Afternoon, how are you?
21/2/24, 1:49 PM - +263 78 702 5922: Im ready for the session

21/2/24, 1:55 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
21/2/24, 2:01 PM - +263 78 702 5922: Thank you very much Miss Ananya, it's very nice to meet you
21/2/24, 2:09 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Now, before we proceed further, I'd love to get to know you better! Would you be willing to share a bit about yourself? Your hobbies, goals, and passions?
21/2/24, 2:14 PM - +263 78 702 5922: Okay

To begin with, I have a passion in Photography, taking pictures in general particularly pictures of people. Additionally, I have a passion for music, I love listening to music every chance I get. My goal, is to be able to leave Zimbabwe, travel the world and return with enough knowledge and resources to be able to enrich the lives of my family back at home and even the lives of those around me.
21/2/24, 2:17 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Wow! Why don't you share a few photos with me?

21/2/24, 2:25 PM - +263 78 702 5922: what I like about photography is that you can sort of tell a story just by looking at a picture
21/2/24, 2:29 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Absolutely! Photography has this amazing ability to capture moments and convey emotions, stories, and messages without words. Each photograph holds a narrative within its frame, allowing viewers to interpret and connect with the story behind the image.
21/2/24, 2:32 PM - +263 78 702 5922: I really hope that I'd be able to get a good camera before leaving for India so I can capture every moment of my journey
21/2/24, 2:33 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Well, have you captured these without a camera?
21/2/24, 2:36 PM - +263 78 702 5922: my camera is really getting old. Although I know that the camera doesn't determine the picture, but the actual person taking the picture.

im just hoping that I can get a newer camera with relatively newer technologies
21/2/24, 2:36 PM - +263 78 702 5922: with that being said, I also wouldn't mind using the one I have
21/2/24, 2:38 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Simbarashe, these pictures are equally amazing and I am sure you will be able to get a new camera!🚀
21/2/24, 2:40 PM - +263 78 702 5922: Thank you!

I also wanted to know, while I'm studying my course will I be given an opportunity to visit Zimbabwe?
22/2/24, 1:41 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Simbarashe!

I hope you are doing well, how are you? Are you ready for your session?🚀
22/2/24, 2:57 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Now that our session time is over, I want to give you an update that our team is taking off tomorrow and won't have any sessions over the weekend. Let's reconvene and continue our discussions on Monday. Have a nice weekend!
26/2/24, 1:31 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Simbarashe!

How are you doing? How was your weekend?🚀
26/2/24, 2:39 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I wish we could have connected for our today's session, however, since our session time is over, let us connect tomorrow at the same time.🚀
27/2/24, 1:05 PM - +263 78 702 5922: good afternoon miss Ananya
27/2/24, 1:05 PM - +263 78 702 5922: how are you doing today?
27/2/24, 1:35 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Simbarashe!

Before we dive into today's session, here's a fun fact about parrots: Did you know that parrots are one of the few animal species that can mimic human speech? Some parrots, like the African grey parrot, have been known to learn hundreds of words and even use them in context! Isn't that amazing?🦜
27/2/24, 2:26 PM - +263 78 702 5922: That is amazing! I had a friend in South Africa who had an African Grey
27/2/24, 2:28 PM - Ananya Edoofa: That's lovely! However, why are you late?
27/2/24, 2:44 PM - +263 78 702 5922: im very sorry for being late, I'm at school and right now I have a free lesson
27/2/24, 2:44 PM - +263 78 702 5922: and my network here at school is not very good
27/2/24, 2:44 PM - +263 78 702 5922: im so sorry for any inconvenience
