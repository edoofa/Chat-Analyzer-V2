2/2/24, 1:33 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Ruvimbo!

I hope you are doing well. Are you ready to begin today's session?
2/2/24, 1:34 PM - +263 78 062 8834: yes,I'm ready
2/2/24, 1:45 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Great! Before we proceed further, I'd love to get to know you better! Would you be willing to share a bit about yourself? Your hobbies, goals, and passions? <This message was edited>
2/2/24, 1:48 PM - +263 78 062 8834: As you already know I'm Ruvimbo Ashley Zimunya and I'm the first child in a family of three.I'm a sport person but I love volleyball more compared to other sporting activities.I'm also good at art and reading novels is part of my hobbie
2/2/24, 1:49 PM - +263 78 062 8834: I did my 'O' level at Hartzell High and my 'A' level at Marange High
2/2/24, 1:57 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Hello Ruvimbo Ashley Zimunya! It's wonderful to learn more about you. Being the first child in a family of three must come with its own set of responsibilities and joys. It's great that you have a passion for sports, particularly volleyball, and that you excel in art as well. Your interests in reading novels sound like a fantastic way to unwind and explore different worlds.
2/2/24, 2:00 PM - +263 78 062 8834: Yes I agree with you,being the first child comes with a set of responsibilities and a lot is expected from you.
2/2/24, 2:05 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Indeed!  Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
2/2/24, 2:11 PM - +263 78 062 8834: Yes a little but it will help if you explain further
2/2/24, 2:19 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
2/2/24, 2:19 PM - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
2/2/24, 2:25 PM - +263 78 062 8834: Well understood!
2/2/24, 2:31 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms. Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
2/2/24, 2:33 PM - +263 78 062 8834: I'm glad to know that the Head of the Department and the Head coach will be assisting throughout the program
2/2/24, 2:44 PM - +263 78 062 8834: Greetings Ms Sanjana and Ms Davi
2/2/24, 2:49 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Well, Ruvimbo, it was nice connecting with you today. I wish we could talk a bit more; however, since our session time is over, let's connect on Monday as we don't have sessions over the weekend!

Happy weekend!🚀
2/2/24, 2:49 PM - +263 78 062 8834: Thank you,stay blessed .
5/2/24, 1:28 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Ruvimbo!

Let us begin our session with an amazing fact! 

_*Did you know that a day on Venus is actually longer than a year on Venus? Even though it only takes Venus about 225 Earth days to go around the sun, it spins really slowly, taking about 243 Earth days to turn once on its axis. So, a day on Venus is longer than a whole year there! 🫨*_
5/2/24, 1:29 PM - +263 78 062 8834: hey ,how are you

I never knew😂
5/2/24, 1:36 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Well, now you know! Also, today I would also like you to be informed of our program structure that will happen after we discuss all our projects in depth (not now), which will mandate us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
5/2/24, 1:37 PM - +263 78 062 8834: that's okay with me
5/2/24, 1:44 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
5/2/24, 1:44 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
5/2/24, 2:06 PM - +263 78 062 8834: I'm done going through the news letter
5/2/24, 2:12 PM - Ananya Edoofa: So may I know which section from the newsletter you *liked the most*, personally for me, it is very difficult to tell, each section has its taste and interest.
5/2/24, 2:13 PM - +263 78 062 8834: the three sections were all amaizing though in different ways
5/2/24, 2:16 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Indeed! now,  I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound?
5/2/24, 2:17 PM - +263 78 062 8834: sounds really interesting!
5/2/24, 2:19 PM - Ananya Edoofa: We’re ready to begin your EWYL program now, and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects you can and will be a part of. Once you’ve gone through it thoroughly- we can discuss your understanding and then help you get started with the projects! Is that clear?
5/2/24, 2:19 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
5/2/24, 2:20 PM - +263 78 062 8834: Noted
5/2/24, 2:30 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Now that our session time is over, I want you to read the document carefully and share your understanding with me before our tomorrow's session. Good day! 🚀
5/2/24, 2:35 PM - +263 78 062 8834: Okay...stay blessed
6/2/24, 11:41 AM - +263 78 062 8834: Hello Ms Ananya,i hope you are doing fine.

I went through the EWYL projects pdf and I can say this programme requires a lot inorder to excell in it.
If I may ask,this task of identifying companies or an organisation as well as being able to reach the managers and communicate effectively with them,is it a group task or it it done as an individual
6/2/24, 1:32 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Ruvimbo!

6/2/24, 1:33 PM - +263 78 062 8834: I'm ready
6/2/24, 1:40 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Well, I read your response, and I must appreciate your grasping power and obedience.
6/2/24, 1:43 PM - +263 78 062 8834: thank you

A linkeld account has to be opened where effective communication will be goin on between the managers and employees of the company and I .
6/2/24, 2:25 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Great! I’m happy with your understanding.
6/2/24, 2:26 PM - Ananya Edoofa: So, I am going to share an extremely significant document with you. Read it thoroughly as well as with careful details. I assure you- it’s as important as it sounds. After reading it, I want you to share what you understood from it. It helps me get a sense of how you’re learning with me!
6/2/24, 2:26 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
6/2/24, 2:30 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Well, now that our session time is over, let us connect in our next session which is tomorrow at the same time. 🚀
7/2/24, 1:33 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Ruvimbo!

Let us begin our session with a fact about elephants: Did you know that elephants are one of the few animals that can recognize themselves in a mirror? This ability indicates a level of self-awareness that is rare in the animal kingdom and suggests that elephants have a complex understanding of themselves and their surroundings. 🐘
7/2/24, 1:35 PM - +263 78 062 8834: hello ,how are you
7/2/24, 1:40 PM - Ananya Edoofa: So, Ruvimbo, did you get a chance to read the document? If yes, kindly share your understanding with me.
7/2/24, 1:45 PM - +263 78 062 8834: Yes I went through the document.
This document is more of a guide on what you are supposed to put in consideration inorder to connect with the best company,for instance factors to consider when choosing a company were outlined which include financial stability and background of the founder.
Furthermore steps to be considered in gathering essential information about the company and even the sites to visit were elaborated clearly.
7/2/24, 1:49 PM - Ananya Edoofa: You know what, this is fantastic! This is the kind of comprehension needed in an Edoofian, and voila! You are already so good at it.
7/2/24, 1:49 PM - +263 78 062 8834: Thank you Ms Ananya
7/2/24, 1:51 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Okay- now here are 2 things I would like to briefly summarize –

Basically I'm supposed to approach family ,friends and relatives who are highly academic oriented and share with them the essence of the Edoofa Scholarship Program as well as the significance of the EWYL and how it helps improve and enhance academic skills in whatever course one will be partaking.

8/2/24, 2:01 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Yes, Ruvimbo!
8/2/24, 2:02 PM - Ananya Edoofa: And #2 – Back to the exciting part- your *Scholarship Credits*. So, here’s a quick recap of what’s the opportunity for you here-

3. There is an additional opportunity to earn $5 worth of Scholarship credits by connecting with students to provide clarity to them about the Edoofa Scholarship, which the Edoofa team will share with you!
8/2/24, 2:03 PM - +263 78 062 8834: Okay
8/2/24, 2:03 PM - +263 78 062 8834: this is fantastic
8/2/24, 2:06 PM - Ananya Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
8/2/24, 2:11 PM - Ananya Edoofa: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*

*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED*
8/2/24, 2:11 PM - Ananya Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
8/2/24, 2:11 PM - Ananya Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)
8/2/24, 2:11 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Once they add you there, you can share the link to YOUR WhatsApp Group (that you created in the first step) and tell them that on that group you will be sharing information about an exciting opportunity where they get a chance to pursue your education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on the tuition fee. To know more, please get added to the group.
8/2/24, 2:11 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
8/2/24, 2:11 PM - Ananya Edoofa: 2] ADD MENTOR:

Make sure that before you start interacting with the participants in the group that you created for the community-building project, YOU ADD ME.

The purpose of doing this is that:
- I will be able to track your progress and guide you through learning the networking skill
- I will be able to see the concerns raised by students and we can discuss them accordingly.
- I will be able to see whether the right information has been shared with all the students

8/2/24, 2:22 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Let me introduce you to the scholarship program that is providing me an opportunity to fulfill all my dreams related to higher education - EDOOFA -Education For All.
8/2/24, 2:22 PM - Ananya Edoofa: To give you an insight about Edoofa, it is a scholarship program initiated by *Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd., INDIA*. Edoofa believes quality education should be accessible to all and not just the privilege of a few. Through our scholarship program that is based on a work-study model, Edoofa solves both problems, that of *lack of affordability and of employability in higher education.* Edoofa stays with the students throughout their academic life as mentor and caretaker, right from building the application, applying to colleges, training, and making them job-ready. This is an experience that I acknowledge as being a Proud Edoofian!🎉
8/2/24, 2:22 PM - Ananya Edoofa: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, Edoofa has worked with 250+ Universities in India and has a community of *more than 3000 students* from different countries📍
8/2/24, 2:22 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Edoofa receives applications from _South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries_. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 2100 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just *affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven* so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains
8/2/24, 2:22 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I would like each one of you to take a look at the video that I am sharing below. The video is regarding Edoofa’s Meet and Greet session where Edoofa’s founders Mr. Angad Singh and Mr. Avreen Singh interacted with various School Principals, African students, and their parents in Harare, Zimbabwe last year.
Please have a look at it and share your thoughts with me.

13/2/24, 1:33 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Ruvimbo!

Let us begin our session with an amazing fact! 

_Did you know that the Arctic Tern holds the record for the longest migration journey of any animal? These remarkable birds travel up to 71,000 kilometers (44,000 miles) round trip every year from their breeding grounds in the Arctic to their wintering grounds in Antarctica and back again. It's an astonishing feat of endurance and navigation!_🐦

13/2/24, 1:35 PM - Ananya Edoofa: TODAY, I would like you to connect with other School Heads. I will be guiding you at every point in this process. Our main aim through this will be to bring the privilege that Edoofa provides to all other fellow school students as well.
13/2/24, 1:38 PM - +263 78 062 8834: Noted but I will have to travel first to meet with those principals because the schools are located far from town
13/2/24, 1:42 PM - Ananya Edoofa: That's alright, you can connect with them over whatsapp! <This message was edited>
13/2/24, 1:43 PM - +263 78 062 8834: Okay
13/2/24, 1:45 PM - Ananya Edoofa: May I know if you have the other School Head’s Whatsapp Contact? And if not I suggest you find it Today so we can move ahead soon.
There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to your Headmaster at School with whom you were close and ask him/her for other School Head’s Contact.
Even before that, you can ask your schoolmates or peers, or neighbors if they have their School Head’s Contact.
13/2/24, 1:48 PM - +263 78 062 8834: Currently I don't have but let me reach to my former Deputyhead  and see if he can pass to me other School Head's Contact.

14/2/24, 2:00 PM - Ananya Edoofa: The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career.

26/2/24, 1:39 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Now, since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how you can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-
1. Give your best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss your EWYL sessions without informing your mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share your challenges and the things you’re good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make your mentor trust you fully
26/2/24, 1:40 PM - +263 78 062 8834: Noted!
26/2/24, 1:46 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Now that we will be beginning our new journey. From now onwards we will be having our session on a dedicated EWYL Line. Please save the EWYL Line contact number: +91 98107 89170.

Every day you have to come and say "I am a proud EDOOFIAN' on the EWYL line.
26/2/24, 1:46 PM - Ananya Edoofa: It serves as a link between every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations.
26/2/24, 1:46 PM - Ananya Edoofa: We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that most of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, "I am a proud Edoofian.
26/2/24, 2:01 PM - +263 78 062 8834: Okay....that's nice
26/2/24, 2:02 PM - Ananya Edoofa: As we plan for our sessions, you have the flexibility to choose between the following options:

Option 1: Monday and Thursday
Option 2: Tuesday and Friday
Feel free to select the days that best suit your schedule. Following your decision, I will provide you with an updated timetable.

Additionally, every Wednesday, I will share a piece of Wednesday wisdom, and we can discuss it in our subsequent session. Similarly, every Saturday, you will receive your weekend activity, and we will review it in our next session. Both of these components are essential for your evaluation and progress, so ensure their completion.

It's crucial to note that you will only receive your lessons and activities if you follow your EWYL (Every Week, Your Life) ritual consistently. Make it a daily practice, especially in the morning, to ensure timely sharing of activities and lessons.
26/2/24, 2:05 PM - +263 78 062 8834: Option 1 is okay with me...Monday and Thursday
26/2/24, 2:05 PM - +263 78 062 8834: Noted!
26/2/24, 2:05 PM - Ananya Edoofa: As a team, we are working towards having more efficient sessions, and therefore, we are making a new plan for our students along with a new platform for us.

Therefore, as soon as we finalize the new plan, I will share a new timetable with you. Meanwhile, I want you to keep working on your projects, and if you face any challenges, you can connect with me.
26/2/24, 2:14 PM - +263 78 062 8834: Okay maam
26/2/24, 2:15 PM - +263 78 062 8834: On Wednesday I'm having a one on one session with Mr Nyahumbi the Headmaster of Chinyauhwera high school,in which I'll be informing him more about the  Edoofa Scholarship Program

Before we dive into today's session, here's a fun fact about parrots: Did you know that parrots are one of the few animal species that can mimic human speech? Some parrots, like the African grey parrot, have been known to learn hundreds of words and even use them in context! Isn't that amazing?🦜
