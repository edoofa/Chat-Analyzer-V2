I really hope that your Christmas went well. Let's discuss how we celebrated our Christmas this year in our session! Come on, join your EWYL Line, and let's talk about our celebration!
29/12/23, 12:19 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Victor!

The current session has commenced, and it appears you're not on your EWYL line. Is it challenging to be present on time? I've noticed a recurring need for reminders. Could we discuss the reason behind this?

5/1/24, 1:09 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Victor!

I'm disappointed to see that you missed today's session. It's crucial to be responsible and attend on time. A lack of punctuality affects not just your progress but also the overall effectiveness of our mentoring. Let's take this seriously, and I expect better attendance in the future. Punctuality is a non-negotiable part of our commitment. Ensure you're on time for our next session.
7/1/24, 10:01 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Victor!

I wanted to share some exciting news with all of you. As you may have noticed, my schedule has been quite packed lately due to work commitments. The reason behind this is something truly special – our team has organized a three-day long industrial visit called SLICE CON' 24 for our Indian Edoofians! 🚀

During this event, we are fortunate to have the Co-founders and CEOs of prominent brands who will be present and sharing their invaluable experiences in one-on-one sessions. Yes, you read that right – they will be there live, right in front of us! What's even more thrilling is that a few of our students are presenting a presentation directly to these CEOs, showcasing why Africa, your homeland, is the best market for their products. 🤝
7/1/24, 10:01 AM - Ananya Edoofa: While I am filled with excitement for this event, please note that due to my involvement in the visit on the 8th, 9th, and 10th of January, our regular sessions won't be taking place on these days. When we connect on the 11th of January, I'll share my students' experiences and pictures with you. 📸✨
7/1/24, 7:02 PM - +263 78 814 3739: Greetings, okay mam noted .
16/1/24, 12:11 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Victor!

I hope you are doing well. I have noticed that you are not following your EWYL ritual on time. It is crucial for you to follow the ritual as it ensures that you do not miss out on any information and important posts. Kindly do it right now, and let us proceed with our session!
23/1/24, 11:20 AM - Ananya Edoofa: *_🌟 URGENT UPDATE 🌟_*

Victor, guess what? I'm super excited to share some awesome news – next month, we're planning a trip to Africa! 🌍 Yep, you heard it right! Our team is coming to your town. Just like last year, our students will be helping us organize the event, and we're looking for volunteers to join in and help manage everything! 🙌

Trust me, it will be an amazing experience with lots to learn! 🌈 Since planning this big event takes time and effort, our team will be so tight. 

In light of this, I'm proposing a slight adjustment to our session timetable. *Today, we won't be having our session as initially planned. However, worry not! I will soon share an updated timetable* and I am confident that together, we will create something truly extraordinary.
1/2/24, 3:13 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Victor!

Remember the event I teased you about in Africa? Well, it's happening next month, and it's going to be massive – the biggest in Zimbabwe's history, with an expected crowd of *5000 people*! Surprising, isn't it? Get ready for an unforgettable experience! 🌍🎉

This time it is bigger and better! Our Founder & CEO, Mr. Angad along with our team, admission officers, and counselors whom all of you have met behind the screens— are up to share priceless insights that will shape your next four years in India.
1/2/24, 3:13 PM - Ananya Edoofa: *We'd like to reserve your seats in advance. Could you please let us know how many people you'll be coming with? This will help us allocate the right number of slots for you.*

I recommend bringing your parents and guardians to the event. They play a crucial role in your education decisions. This event offers them a chance to understand the program and witness the journeys of past students, providing valuable insights for your higher education journey in India. So, get ready for this epic adventure, and I'll share the details with you super soon!
7/2/24, 11:16 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Victor!

I have been expecting to hear from you for the past couple of days, but I can see you have not been able to get back to me for certain reasons I am unaware of. You see, I have been looking forward to having you at the event as I know how beneficial it will be for you. Most of my students have already quite enthusiastically reserved seats for themselves and their family and friends.

Is everything alright? Are you facing any challenges? Is there something you'd like to share?
