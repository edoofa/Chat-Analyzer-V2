Your aspiration to become a renowned developer on an international scale is ambitious and admirable. It's clear that your passion for this field is a strong driving force. Moreover, your desire to alleviate your family's financial burden is both noble and inspiring. With your determination and focus, I have no doubt that you'll achieve great success in your goals. Keep pushing forward, and remember that every step you take brings you closer to realizing your dreams.
12/2/24, 2:19 PM - +263 78 739 4878: Thank you
12/2/24, 2:20 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
12/2/24, 2:20 PM - +263 78 739 4878: No l do not can you please explain
12/2/24, 2:21 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
12/2/24, 2:22 PM - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
12/2/24, 2:26 PM - +263 78 739 4878: I now understand what the 2 goals mean and what they represent <This message was edited>

How does that sound?
22/2/24, 1:56 PM - +263 78 739 4878: Sounds amazing
22/2/24, 2:04 PM - Ananya Edoofa: We’re ready to begin your EWYL program now, and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects you can and will be a part of. Once you’ve gone through it thoroughly- we can discuss your understanding and then help you get started with the projects! Is that clear?
22/2/24, 2:05 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
22/2/24, 2:59 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Now that our session time is over, I want to give you an update that our team is taking off tomorrow and won't have any sessions over the weekend. Let's reconvene and continue our discussions on Monday. Have a nice weekend!

Before we dive into today's session, here's a fun fact about parrots: Did you know that parrots are one of the few animal species that can mimic human speech? Some parrots, like the African grey parrot, have been known to learn hundreds of words and even use them in context! Isn't that amazing?🦜

27/2/24, 1:49 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Alright,  I will start by explaining the projects in detail. I am sharing an audio file with you. Here’s my suggestion- listen to it at least twice, you know- to make sure we don’t miss anything out, and then get back to me when you are finished with the process!

27/2/24, 2:04 PM - +263 78 739 4878: Yes,so l was encouraged to seize opportunities first from people that are close to me such as parents,family and parents of my friends 

I also heard of an application called Linkden that l am advised to use to make it easier

27/2/24, 2:07 PM - Ananya Edoofa: So, I am going to share an extremely significant document with you. Read it thoroughly as well as with careful details. I assure you- it’s as important as it sounds.
