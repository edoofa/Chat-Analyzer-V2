9/2/24, 1:42 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
9/2/24, 1:55 PM - +260 96 8635206: Great
9/2/24, 1:58 PM - +260 96 8635206: Wonderful
9/2/24, 2:17 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Before we proceed further, I'd love to get to know you better! Would you be willing to share a bit about yourself? Your hobbies, goals, and passions?
9/2/24, 2:24 PM - +260 96 8635206: Well, My name is Esau Ackson Zulu, a 17-year-old from the vibrant nation of Zambia. With a zest for soccer matches and a penchant for delving into the pages  of books, I find joy in both the thrill of the game and the depths of knowledge found within literature. However, beyond my hobbies lies a burning passion and unwavering goal: to become an electrical engineer.

Fueled by curiosity and a desire to make a tangible difference, I envision a future where I contribute to Zambia's development through innovative electrical engineering solutions. With each goal scored on the soccer field and each chapter turned in a book, I am reminded of the perseverance and dedication required to achieve my aspirations.

As I embark on this journey, I am excited to embrace challenges, seize opportunities, and ultimately, leave a lasting impact on my community and country. With determination as my compass and knowledge as my guiding light, I am  aspiring to become an electrical engineer, ready to make waves in the world of engineering and beyond.
9/2/24, 2:39 PM - Ananya Edoofa: It's great to meet you! Your passion for both chess and netball sounds exciting. They're both fantastic ways to challenge yourself mentally and physically while having fun. Pursuing a career in law is a commendable goal, and I'm sure with your dedication and determination, you'll achieve great success. Your aspiration to help others in need speaks volumes about your character, and I have no doubt you'll make a positive impact in whatever path you choose. Keep striving for your dreams, and never hesitate to reach out if you need support along the way. Wishing you all the best on your journey!
9/2/24, 2:47 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
9/2/24, 3:10 PM - +260 96 8635206: Sorry madam but I think this message wasn't meant for me, because I mentioned soccer and electrical engineering  not netball, chess and law
9/2/24, 3:10 PM - +260 96 8635206: Happy weekend to you too
12/2/24, 1:34 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Zulu!

How was your weekend? Are you ready for your session?🚀
12/2/24, 2:04 PM - +260 96 8635206: Yes madam
12/2/24, 2:09 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Zulu, why are you late?
12/2/24, 2:21 PM - +260 96 8635206: Sorry madam the network here is a bit poor
12/2/24, 2:22 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Alright. Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
12/2/24, 2:24 PM - +260 96 8635206: Yes madam
12/2/24, 2:25 PM - +260 96 8635206: But it would be good if you kindly go through them again
12/2/24, 2:29 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I wish we could have connected for a longer time. However, since our session time is over, let's connect tomorrow at the same time. Have a good day!🌟
12/2/24, 2:30 PM - +260 96 8635206: Alright madam have a good day
13/2/24, 1:48 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Zulu!

I have observed that you have not been texting me at your session timings; it has always been me who drops a reminder message at your session time. Has your teacher ever dropped a reminder message to you before the class?
13/2/24, 1:53 PM - +260 96 8635206: No madam
13/2/24, 1:57 PM - +260 96 8635206: Sorry for the late responses but we may now begin madam
13/2/24, 2:36 PM - Ananya Edoofa: That's alright, however now that our session time is over, let us connect tomorrow at the same time. Have a good day ahead!🚀
13/2/24, 2:41 PM - +260 96 8635206: Alright madam have a good day too
14/2/24, 1:31 PM - +260 96 8635206: Good afternoon madam I ready for the lesson
14/2/24, 1:41 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Zulu!

How are you doing? Are you ready for the session?🚀
14/2/24, 1:42 PM - +260 96 8635206: I'm alright and yourself madam?
14/2/24, 1:42 PM - +260 96 8635206: And im very ready for the session madam
14/2/24, 1:52 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Great! So,  Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
14/2/24, 1:52 PM - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
14/2/24, 1:53 PM - +260 96 8635206: Understood
14/2/24, 2:02 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms. Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
14/2/24, 2:16 PM - +260 96 8635206: Alright madam
14/2/24, 2:18 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure that will happen after we discuss all our projects in depth (not now), which will mandate us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
14/2/24, 2:19 PM - +260 96 8635206: Very much actually
14/2/24, 2:20 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
14/2/24, 2:21 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
14/2/24, 2:39 PM - +260 96 8635206: This is amazing

21/2/24, 1:31 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Let us begin our session with an interesting fact: _Africa is home to the world's largest land mammal - the African elephant. These majestic creatures can weigh up to 6 metric tons (approximately 13,000 pounds) and are known for their intelligence, complex social structures, and remarkable memory. Isn't that incredible?_
21/2/24, 1:32 PM - +260 96 8635206: Very much
21/2/24, 1:37 PM - Ananya Edoofa: It's Zimbabwe however don't worry our team will come to Zambia as well!

21/2/24, 1:49 PM - Ananya Edoofa: We’re ready to begin your EWYL program now, and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects you can and will be a part of. Once you’ve gone through it thoroughly- we can discuss your understanding and then help you get started with the projects! Is that clear?
21/2/24, 1:49 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
21/2/24, 1:50 PM - +260 96 8635206: Crystal clear
21/2/24, 1:56 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I want you to share your understanding of the document with me. I just want to ensure we don’t miss anything! So, please, go on sharing your understanding of the above document.
21/2/24, 1:57 PM - +260 96 8635206: Well madam there's quite alot to read and im still reading but the moment I do finish I will share
21/2/24, 2:07 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Alright!
21/2/24, 2:12 PM - +260 96 8635206: But from what I've read so far is that as the world keeps on moving new challenges come about and the Edoofa team makes it it's top tier priority to enable their students to be ready for what the future holds by preparing them and exposing them to projects that will help them prepare for future reference
21/2/24, 2:17 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Alright! Now let me explain you the projects from the document.
21/2/24, 2:17 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I will start by explaining the projects in detail. I am sharing an audio file with you. Here’s my suggestion- listen to it at least twice, you know- to make sure we don’t miss anything out, and then get back to me when you are finished with the process!
21/2/24, 2:17 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
21/2/24, 2:17 PM - +260 96 8635206: Alright!
21/2/24, 2:20 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Okay, so very quickly you summarize whatever you learned in the audio for me? Just so we’re on the same page about it.
21/2/24, 2:28 PM - +260 96 8635206: So to begin with the first project is the "COOPERATE ALLIANCE"
In this my aim will be to understand the market I'll be working with in the future and since the world was struck by the pandemic this will thus give me a chance to connect with this companies better via online. Then first of all I'll have to open a linden account to help me look for these companies and their decision makers and I have to make sure I get their contacts so that I form a meeting with the Edoofa team
21/2/24, 2:29 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good work, Zulu!
21/2/24, 2:29 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I am going to share an extremely significant document with you. Read it thoroughly as well as with careful details. I assure you- it’s as important as it sounds. After reading it, I want you to share what you understood from it. It helps me get a sense of how you’re learning with me!

22/2/24, 12:59 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Zulu!

I'm happy to share that our team just got back from an incredible event in Zimbabwe, and let me tell you, this time our Meet & Greet event was bigger and better! It was an amazing three-day event! 🎉

This time, it wasn't just Mr. Angad who went, but our whole admissions team, counseling team, and the program director joined in too!

Students and parents alike had the exclusive opportunity to dive deep into the exciting journey that awaits them in India. And guess what? Mr. Angad himself talked about exciting employment opportunities for everyone in India along with the EWYL plan. We also organized a special scholarship test for students who aren't part of the Edoofian community yet. 

I've got some photos to share with you. Get ready for a sneak peek into the excitement and energy of the event!

Also, we're planning to bring the excitement to Zambia too! So, get ready to embark on a journey filled with endless possibilities and boundless opportunities.

26/2/24, 1:39 PM - Ananya Edoofa: *Now that we’ve both summarized our understanding of the project, I think we’re ready to move to the next project!* This project is quite possibly a student favorite!

26/2/24, 1:40 PM - +260 96 8635206: Alright
26/2/24, 1:46 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>

27/2/24, 1:37 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Zulu!

Before we dive into today's session, here's a fun fact about parrots: Did you know that parrots are one of the few animal species that can mimic human speech? Some parrots, like the African grey parrot, have been known to learn hundreds of words and even use them in context! Isn't that amazing?🦜
27/2/24, 1:43 PM - +260 96 8635206: Wow
27/2/24, 1:46 PM - Ananya Edoofa: So, did you get a chance to read the document?
27/2/24, 1:47 PM - +260 96 8635206: Yes madam
27/2/24, 1:48 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I want you to share your understanding of the document with me. I just want to ensure we don’t miss anything! So, please, go on sharing your understanding of the above document.
27/2/24, 1:51 PM - +260 96 8635206: So the document gives me more insight on how I can access the acquired companies for my project
27/2/24, 1:52 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I can also help you with this :

1. _Avoid reaching out to large-scale companies._
2. The company can be _African or Indian_. If the company is Indian then it should have some operation or association in African nations.
3. The _target audience_ of the company should focus on youth. Domains- Ed-Tech, E-Commerce, Gaming, Skincare, Haircare, Cosmetics, Media/PR, Food and Beverages, etc.
4. The company should _not_ belong to these particular sectors:
- Manufacturing
- Finance
- Real Estate/Construction
