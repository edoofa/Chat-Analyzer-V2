16/1/24, 2:15 PM - +263 78 006 5624: Ok l will but as for now they are using my phone
16/1/24, 2:17 PM - Ananya Edoofa: That's alright! <This message was edited>
16/1/24, 2:17 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
16/1/24, 2:28 PM - +263 78 006 5624: Which are those two key objectives
16/1/24, 2:29 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
16/1/24, 2:30 PM - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
16/1/24, 2:32 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Now that our session time is over, let us conclude our session here, and remember, every effort you put in is a step closer to success. Keep participating, stay motivated, and earn those credits! You're all doing great, and I look forward to our continued journey together. See you next time!ac
17/1/24, 8:50 PM - +263 78 006 5624: Oooh ok l now understand the two key objectives
18/1/24, 1:32 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Mercy!

Kindly excuse me for not being able to connect with you yesterday. Unfortunately, due to bad health, I had to take a day off.
18/1/24, 1:44 PM - +263 78 006 5624: Oooh ok l get you so how are you feeling now
18/1/24, 1:52 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Thank you for asking, I am doing better now!
18/1/24, 1:53 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms. Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
18/1/24, 2:34 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I was hoping to hear from your end, however since our session time is over, let us connect in our next session now.
18/1/24, 3:26 PM - +263 78 006 5624: Ok thanks for the introduction
19/1/24, 1:34 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Mercy
Before beginning today's session, I want you to check out this incredible post :

https://www.instagram.com/p/CzVl_ADBbbz/?igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==
19/1/24, 1:41 PM - +263 78 006 5624: Greatings to you
19/1/24, 1:47 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Today,I would also like you to be informed of our program structure that will happen after we discuss all our projects in depth (not now), which will mandate us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
19/1/24, 1:50 PM - +263 78 006 5624: Yeah it sounds so interesting l just can't wait for this
19/1/24, 1:52 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.

24/1/24, 1:53 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
24/1/24, 2:23 PM - +263 78 006 5624: Ok it's fine but allow to reply you at 5:00 PM because as for now I'm at work
24/1/24, 2:26 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Mercy, While I understand and appreciate that you are working to finance your education, it is crucial for you to finish your EWYL orientation with me, as mentioned earlier. If you are not able to do that, you can ask your parents to attend the session with me and understand the basics of the program.

This will ensure a smooth process, and we can later connect on the projects only. Please let me know if you proceed in this manner.
24/1/24, 2:34 PM - +263 78 006 5624: My parents will also be at work trying to raise money for my education
24/1/24, 2:37 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Well, let's do one thing then! We can fast-track your orientation, and whenever you're free, you can resume from there. Is that alright?
24/1/24, 3:01 PM - +263 78 006 5624: Ok l get you
25/1/24, 1:37 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Mercy!

Let us begin our session with a fun fact: 

The tongue of a blue whale, the largest animal on Earth, can weigh as much as an elephant. Despite their massive size, blue whales primarily feed on tiny shrimp-like animals called krill, using their enormous tongues to filter them from the water.🐋
25/1/24, 1:50 PM - +263 78 006 5624: Wow interesting
25/1/24, 1:50 PM - +263 78 006 5624: Greetings to you

_*Did you know that a day on Venus is actually longer than a year on Venus? Even though it only takes Venus about 225 Earth days to go around the sun, it spins really slowly, taking about 243 Earth days to turn once on its axis. So, a day on Venus is longer than a whole year there! 🫨*_

Let us begin our session with a fact about elephants: Did you know that elephants are one of the few animals that can recognize themselves in a mirror?

26/2/24, 1:46 PM - Ananya Edoofa: My weekend was amazing, finally after days of hard work, I got some rest and spent some quality time with my family.😅

26/2/24, 1:53 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Now, Let me help you with the kind of communication that you should do with the school heads, okay?



Before we start, I want you to answer the questions that I am sharing below:
Q1. Please mention the name of your school. Is your school connected with Edoofa?
Q2. Please share the messages that you will use when you reach out to the School Heads.
Q3. Name of the Province where your school is located.
26/2/24, 2:19 PM - +263 78 006 5624: 1.Chiredzi Christian College. No it is not connected
26/2/24, 2:22 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Great! Now that your school is not partnered with us,I would like you to connect with your School Head. I will be guiding you at every point in this process. Our main aim through this will be to bring the privilege that Edoofa provides to all your schoolmates.
26/2/24, 2:38 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I wish we could have connected for more time, however, since our session time is over, let us connect tomorrow at the same time.🚀
27/2/24, 1:37 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Mercy!

Before we dive into today's session, here's a fun fact about parrots: Did you know that parrots are one of the few animal species that can mimic human speech? Some parrots, like the African grey parrot, have been known to learn hundreds of words and even use them in context! Isn't that amazing?🦜
27/2/24, 1:43 PM - +263 78 006 5624: 🤔🤔🤔it is really amaizing
27/2/24, 1:45 PM - Ananya Edoofa: May I know if you have the Whatsapp contact of the School Head whom you want us to reach out to? And if not I would suggest you find it today so that we can move ahead soon.
There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to any teacher or student at School with whom you are in touch and ask him/her for your School Head’s Contact.
27/2/24, 1:46 PM - +263 78 006 5624: Ok let me send you
27/2/24, 1:50 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Great! Now that you have the School Head’s Contact, It is time for us to reach out to the school head in a professional manner. With poor communication, it's easy for messages to get misunderstood. By mastering the professional touch, the potential for misunderstandings occurring can be minimized.
27/2/24, 1:50 PM - Ananya Edoofa: The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career.
