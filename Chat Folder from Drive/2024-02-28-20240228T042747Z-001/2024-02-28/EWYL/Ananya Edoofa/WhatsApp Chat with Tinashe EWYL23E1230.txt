Let us begin our session with a fact about elephants: Did you know that elephants are one of the few animals that can recognize themselves in a mirror? This ability indicates a level of self-awareness that is rare in the animal kingdom and suggests that elephants have a complex understanding of themselves and their surroundings. 🐘

8/2/24, 10:10 AM - +27 61 220 8989: Good morning to everyone 🙏
8/2/24, 10:16 AM - +27 61 220 8989: Truly saying although I have data, sometimes it doesn't connect to the internet. I think it is because there was load shading or something.
8/2/24, 12:46 PM - +27 61 616 4588: Good morning how are you every one
9/2/24, 9:00 AM - +27 61 220 8989: Good morning 🙏
9/2/24, 12:26 PM - +27 61 220 8989: Good afternoon my mentors, can you please change my schedule time from 0830 to 1330 , because in the morning there is load shedding from 0800 to 1100 causing network connection problems.
11/2/24, 12:03 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Tinashe!

I understand that there is a short delay in our conversation; however, amidst the preparations, I also fell sick. Therefore, it took me two days to recover.

Fortunately, I am feeling better now and we can connect tomorrow at 1:30 PM instead of 8:30 am. Is that alright?
12/2/24, 8:36 AM - Ananya Edoofa: This message was deleted

12/2/24, 2:24 PM - +27 61 220 8989: Soo network connection is very low.
12/2/24, 2:29 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I wish we could have connected for a longer time. However, since our session time is over, let's connect tomorrow at the same time. Have a good day!🌟
13/2/24, 1:33 PM - +27 61 616 4588: I want to pay the balance for that 350 I  want to pay $150 so I need order for mama money such that I can do the deposit

13/2/24, 1:36 PM - Ananya Edoofa: How are you @27612208989 ?

How are you doing? Are you ready for the session?🚀
14/2/24, 1:43 PM - +27 61 220 8989: yes I am please
14/2/24, 1:53 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
14/2/24, 1:59 PM - +27 61 220 8989: Yes I do
14/2/24, 2:06 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
14/2/24, 2:06 PM - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
14/2/24, 2:11 PM - +27 61 220 8989: Soo is it possible for one to earn credits that would cover the whole of their fees.

14/2/24, 2:28 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Haha, definitely Tinashe!
14/2/24, 2:28 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the EWYL team. 
Ms. Sanjana is the Head of the Department and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have Ms. Davi, Head coach is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
14/2/24, 2:33 PM - +27 61 220 8989: Okay Greatings to all, it's a pleasure to be part of your program.
14/2/24, 2:37 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
14/2/24, 2:37 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>

How does that sound?
26/2/24, 1:57 PM - +27 61 220 8989: It sounds great.
26/2/24, 1:59 PM - Ananya Edoofa: We’re ready to begin your EWYL program now, and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects you can and will be a part of. Once you’ve gone through it thoroughly- we can discuss your understanding and then help you get started with the projects! Is that clear?
26/2/24, 1:59 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>

Before we dive into today's session, here's a fun fact about parrots: Did you know that parrots are one of the few animal species that can mimic human speech? Some parrots, like the African grey parrot, have been known to learn hundreds of words and even use them in context! Isn't that amazing?🦜
27/2/24, 1:46 PM - +27 61 220 8989: That's an interesting fact,     Soo in other words it means   it has  senses as a human.
27/2/24, 1:47 PM - Ananya Edoofa: No, it has a sense of mimicking!
27/2/24, 1:51 PM - +27 61 220 8989: Yeah it can hear, see and talk.
27/2/24, 1:52 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Yes, so did you get a chance to read the document?
27/2/24, 1:53 PM - +27 61 220 8989: Yes I did.
27/2/24, 1:53 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I want you to share your understanding of the document with me. I just want to ensure we don’t miss anything! So, please, go on sharing your understanding of the above document.
27/2/24, 2:07 PM - +27 61 220 8989: Edoofa projects     builds up students to be advanced in this era ,by making them familiar with social media platforms for marketing, advertising i.e online businessing
27/2/24, 2:09 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Great!  I will start by explaining the projects in detail. I am sharing an audio file with you. Here’s my suggestion- listen to it at least twice, you know- to make sure we don’t miss anything out, and then get back to me when you are finished with the process!
27/2/24, 2:09 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
27/2/24, 2:24 PM - +27 61 220 8989: I went through it  .
27/2/24, 2:26 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Okay, so very quickly you summarize whatever you learned in the audio for me? Just so we’re on the same page about it.
27/2/24, 2:30 PM - +27 61 220 8989: He said must create an account on LinkedIn, for me to talk to decision makers in the business sector and set a meeting and edoofa will discuss with them further more about the project.
27/2/24, 2:36 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, that's all for today's session.. In the meantime, remember to start working on your projects. If you encounter any challenges along the way, don't hesitate to reach out. I'm here to help.
