6/2/24, 9:22 AM - +260 760061219: My grandfather is in a meeting at the moment.
6/2/24, 9:24 AM - Ananya Edoofa: That's alright, you can share the invite and he can join later.  Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
6/2/24, 9:27 AM - +260 760061219: No please.
6/2/24, 9:27 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals. <This message was edited>
6/2/24, 9:27 AM - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
6/2/24, 9:28 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, now that our session time is over, let us reconnect tomorrow at the same time.

Have a good day ahead!🚀
6/2/24, 9:29 AM - +260 760061219: Thank you very much, you too.
7/2/24, 8:26 AM - +260 760061219: Good morning Ms Ananya.
7/2/24, 8:37 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Magdaline!

Let us begin our session with a fact about elephants: Did you know that elephants are one of the few animals that can recognize themselves in a mirror? This ability indicates a level of self-awareness that is rare in the animal kingdom and suggests that elephants have a complex understanding of themselves and their surroundings. 🐘
7/2/24, 8:38 AM - +260 760061219: I didn’t quite know that.
7/2/24, 8:43 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms. Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
7/2/24, 8:44 AM - +260 760061219: Thank you.
7/2/24, 8:46 AM - Ananya Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure that will happen after we discuss all our projects in depth (not now), which will mandate us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
7/2/24, 8:48 AM - +260 760061219: Yes please.
7/2/24, 8:50 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
7/2/24, 8:50 AM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
7/2/24, 9:01 AM - +260 760061219: I’m finished but I must say, the quotes are really inspiring.
7/2/24, 9:03 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Did you notice the _Edoofa Hall of Inspiration_? I am sure you would one day want yourself to be celebrated in this section, the entire Student community reads this newsletter and it's a great deal to be mentioned by the founder himself, isn't it?
7/2/24, 9:04 AM - +260 760061219: Yes please.
7/2/24, 9:07 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Great! Now, At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound?
7/2/24, 9:08 AM - +260 760061219: Sounds pleasant.
7/2/24, 9:23 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for the delayed response, I was facing some technical glitch.

Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects you can and will be a part of.

7/2/24, 9:32 AM - +260 760061219: Thank you very much.

8/2/24, 8:48 AM - +260 760061219: The audio is about familiarizing with the marketing place for which you will be working in, in the near future. And also create a linked in account to help you connect with different business organizations.
8/2/24, 8:54 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Great! So, I am going to share an extremely significant document with you. Read it thoroughly as well as with careful details. I assure you- it’s as important as it sounds. After reading it, I want you to share what you understood from it. It helps me get a sense of how you’re learning with me!

13/2/24, 8:44 AM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
13/2/24, 8:49 AM - +260 760061219: When am I likely to create the WhatsApp link?
13/2/24, 8:50 AM - Ananya Edoofa: This message was deleted
13/2/24, 8:52 AM - +260 760061219: Can I please have some time to look for students that are eligible for the program please.
13/2/24, 8:52 AM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
13/2/24, 8:53 AM - +260 760061219: Thank you very much.
13/2/24, 8:54 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, in order to move ahead with your second project, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
13/2/24, 8:54 AM - Ananya Edoofa: I am ____________, a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in *Zimbabwe*, where tuition fees range from ZWL 650,000 to ZWL 750,000 per term. When considering the yearly cost, including food and accommodation, it exceeds $2,100 in our beloved Zimbabwe⏫

Today, the internet is a necessity, and I truly realized its importance when preparing for my journey to India. We are all well aware of the expenses we have to bear just to access subpar internet services. During my school days, I used to spend a minimum of $35-$40 a month to ensure I had sufficient internet, which added up to around $450-$500 annually.
*It's remarkable to discover that in India, students value their educational infrastructure so much that they can access a necessity like the internet for around $40 for the entire year.*💥
Conversely, when speaking to my seniors in Zimbabwe, I realized that I might have to compromise on my choice of course due to limited available seats. Furthermore, many seniors are struggling with unemployment after graduating in Zimbabwe
I had a strong desire to support my family through part-time employment during my course, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn between $50 and $100 per month throughout the course.
*While pursuing tertiary education in India is more affordable than universities in Zimbabwe, it comes with its own challenges. I diligently followed the 5S, which played a crucial role in helping me qualify for this scholarship. I urge you to go through these Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors will ask you questions based on the information in the flyer I have attached*
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5s of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

13/2/24, 8:54 AM - Ananya Edoofa: To give you an insight about Edoofa, it is a scholarship program initiated by *Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd., INDIA*. Edoofa believes quality education should be accessible to all and not just the privilege of a few. Through our scholarship program that is based on a work-study model, Edoofa solves both problems, that of *lack of affordability and of employability in higher education.* Edoofa stays with the students throughout their academic life as mentor and caretaker, right from building the application, applying to colleges, training, and making them job-ready. This is an experience that I acknowledge as being a Proud Edoofian!🎉

13/2/24, 8:54 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Edoofa receives applications from _South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries_. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 2100 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just *affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven* so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains
13/2/24, 8:54 AM - Ananya Edoofa: I would like each one of you to take a look at the video that I am sharing below.

13/2/24, 9:01 AM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
13/2/24, 9:05 AM - +260 760061219: Is there a limit to how many schools can be involved?
13/2/24, 9:07 AM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
13/2/24, 9:07 AM - +260 760061219: Alright, I’ll do my best.
13/2/24, 9:08 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Okay great, now allow me to recap this project quickly for you in 2 steps:
13/2/24, 9:08 AM - Ananya Edoofa: As a proud edoofian and as a student who is going to go for international higher education, you will connect with various principals on this project. You will introduce yourself, and share with them how you got the scholarship and what your future aspirations are.​
13/2/24, 9:08 AM - Ananya Edoofa: ​After that, you will share in details about the program with the principals and ask them if you can schedule a call with the Edooa program Director so that the students of their school can also achieve the same.
13/2/24, 9:08 AM - Ananya Edoofa: After the school authorities respond to your message and you can set up our meeting with them, you can ask them about the date and the time when they would be available. Once you get that information, you can send me the school details and the time and date of the meeting via this form.
13/2/24, 9:08 AM - Ananya Edoofa: You can use the following form to share the school details with me.

13/2/24, 9:21 AM - +260 760061219: Sure thing.
13/2/24, 9:21 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Now, Let me help you with the kind of communication that you should do with the school heads, okay?



Before we start, I want you to answer the questions that I am sharing below:
Q1. Please mention the name of your school. Is your school connected with Edoofa?
Q2. Please share the messages that you will use when you reach out to the School Heads.
Q3. Name of the Province where your school is located.
13/2/24, 9:24 AM - +260 760061219: Q1. Legacy. 
       I have not yet connected the school. 
Q1. Sure thing. 
Q3. North-Western province.
13/2/24, 9:24 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Great! Well, as per our records, your school is not connected with us. And Voila! You can therefore connect with your own school and earn credits at an initial stage!
13/2/24, 9:25 AM - +260 760061219: I will connect the school as soon as I can.
13/2/24, 9:27 AM - Ananya Edoofa: May I know if you have the Whatsapp contact of the School Head whom you want us to reach out to? And if not I would suggest you find it today so that we can move ahead soon.
There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to any teacher or student at School with whom you are in touch and ask him/her for your School Head’s Contact.
13/2/24, 9:28 AM - +260 760061219: I do have the contact number, should I share it now?
13/2/24, 9:29 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Now that our session time is over, let us discuss this further tomorrow at the same time.

Remember that your consistency is something that will earn you credits here, so be regular, and trust me, no one can stop you from being the top! All the best, good day! 🚀
13/2/24, 9:29 AM - +260 760061219: Thank you very much.
14/2/24, 8:25 AM - +260 760061219: Good morning.
14/2/24, 8:40 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Magdaline!

How are you doing? Are you ready for the session?🚀
14/2/24, 8:40 AM - +260 760061219: Yes please.
14/2/24, 8:47 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Now that you have the School Head’s Contact, It is time for us to reach out to the school head in a professional manner. With poor communication, it's easy for messages to get misunderstood. By mastering the professional touch, the potential for misunderstandings occurring can be minimized.
14/2/24, 8:47 AM - Ananya Edoofa: The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career.
14/2/24, 8:50 AM - +260 760061219: Yes please.
14/2/24, 8:52 AM - Ananya Edoofa: _So, This is what the First message should look like:_

Greetings Mr./Mrs *School Head Name*!
Hope you are doing well.

I am *Your Name* and I am a beneficiary of the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
I stand obliged to get an opportunity to connect with you, I hope to have a result/conclusion-driven conversation with you today.

May I know at what time you will be available to connect via Whatsapp?
14/2/24, 8:53 AM - +260 760061219: I had a chat with him yesterday and he said he will be free on Friday afternoon.
14/2/24, 8:55 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, so on that day, ask him to fill out the form.
14/2/24, 8:55 AM - +260 760061219: Sure thing.
14/2/24, 8:59 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Now, we’ve come to the end of one part of your onboarding of EWYL. So, I want you to go through this conversation quickly- and highlight any areas, questions, or projects that you may have even the slightest concern with- and let’s resolve them before we move on!
14/2/24, 9:05 AM - +260 760061219: I’m all clear please.
14/2/24, 9:14 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Now, since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how you can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-
1. Give your best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss your EWYL sessions without informing your mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share your challenges and the things you’re good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make your mentor trust you fully
14/2/24, 9:15 AM - +260 760061219: Yes please.
14/2/24, 9:17 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Now that we will be beginning our new journey. From now onwards we will be having our session on a dedicated EWYL Line. Please save the EWYL Line contact number: +91 98107 89170.

Every day you have to come and say "I am a proud EDOOFIAN' on the EWYL line.
It serves as a link between every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers.
14/2/24, 9:17 AM - Ananya Edoofa: The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that most of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, "I am a proud Edoofian.
14/2/24, 9:17 AM - Ananya Edoofa: As we plan for our sessions, you have the flexibility to choose between the following options:

Option 1: Monday and Thursday
Option 2: Tuesday and Friday
Feel free to select the days that best suit your schedule. Following your decision, I will provide you with an updated timetable.

Additionally, every Wednesday, I will share a piece of Wednesday wisdom, and we can discuss it in our subsequent session. Similarly, every Saturday, you will receive your weekend activity, and we will review it in our next session. Both of these components are essential for your evaluation and progress, so ensure their completion.

It's crucial to note that you will only receive your lessons and activities if you follow your EWYL (Every Week, Your Life) ritual consistently. Make it a daily practice, especially in the morning, to ensure timely sharing of activities and lessons.
14/2/24, 9:19 AM - +260 760061219: I would like to follow the first option.
14/2/24, 9:20 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Alright! Now, we are ready to begin our new journey! Before that, I'm super excited to share some awesome news – next month, we're planning a trip to Africa! 🌍 Yep, you heard it right! Our team is coming to your town. 

Trust me, it will be an amazing experience with lots to learn! 🌈 Since planning this big event takes time and effort, our team will be so tight. 

Because of this, I'm proposing a slight adjustment to our session timetable. As of now, we won't be having our session as initially planned. However, worry not! I will soon share an updated timetable. Meanwhile, you can keep working on your targets and keep me posted on your EWYL group.
14/2/24, 9:21 AM - +260 760061219: Sure thing.
15/2/24, 8:39 AM - +260 760061219: Good morning, Ms Ananya.
17/2/24, 12:40 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Magdaline!

I hope this message finds you well. I apologize for not being able to connect with you yesterday. Unfortunately, I experienced a technical glitch that prevented me from accessing my WhatsApp account. I've managed to restore it this morning.
17/2/24, 2:32 PM - +260 760061219: All is well, Ms Ananya.
17/2/24, 2:36 PM - +260 760061219: I managed to collect some applications from students.
19/2/24, 8:31 AM - +260 760061219: Good morning, Ms Ananya.
19/2/24, 8:56 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Magdaline!

Great, you have to share the forms here in the group.

I'm happy to share that our team just got back from an incredible event in Zimbabwe, and let me tell you, this time our Meet & Greet event was bigger and better! It was an amazing three-day event! 🎉

This time, it wasn't just Mr. Angad who went, but our whole admissions team, counseling team, and the program director joined in too!

Students and parents alike had the exclusive opportunity to dive deep into the exciting journey that awaits them in India. And guess what? Mr. Angad himself talked about exciting employment opportunities for everyone in India along with the EWYL plan. We also organized a special scholarship test for students who aren't part of the Edoofian community yet. 

I've got some photos to share with you. Get ready for a sneak peek into the excitement and energy of the event!

Also, we're planning to bring the excitement to Zambia too! So, get ready to embark on a journey filled with endless possibilities and boundless opportunities.
