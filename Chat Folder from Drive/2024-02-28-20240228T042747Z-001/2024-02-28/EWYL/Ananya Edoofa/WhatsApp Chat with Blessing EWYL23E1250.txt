We will connect from Monday to Friday at 8:30 am to complete our orientation. Later, we will connect twice a week, for which I will share the slots after completing your orientation. <This message was edited>
12/2/24, 8:42 AM - +263 71 435 1714: It's fine ma'am but l did not understand the the last phrase written ' *we will connect t* '
12/2/24, 8:47 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Kindly excuse me, is it okay now?
12/2/24, 8:48 AM - +263 71 435 1714: Yes it's okay
12/2/24, 8:49 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Wonderful, my student! So, to kick things off with a bang, I wanted to share a fantastic video with you that I think will help us connect on a deeper level. Get ready to be inspired!
12/2/24, 8:49 AM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
12/2/24, 8:55 AM - +263 71 435 1714: Thank you ma'am for the warm welcome. We will work together to reach the summit as you believe sure.l am glad to have you as my mentor.
12/2/24, 9:02 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Before we proceed further, I'd love to get to know you better! Would you be willing to share a bit about yourself? Your hobbies, goals, and passions?
12/2/24, 9:14 AM - +263 71 435 1714: <Media omitted>
12/2/24, 9:16 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Well,  Your curiosity and enthusiasm for this field have not gone unnoticed, and I wanted to commend you for your dedication to expanding your knowledge in this area.

It's truly inspiring to see students like you showing such genuine interest in electronic engineering. Your willingness to explore and engage with this complex and fascinating subject speaks volumes about your dedication to learning and your potential for future success.
12/2/24, 9:17 AM - +263 71 435 1714: Thank you ma'am.
12/2/24, 9:19 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
12/2/24, 9:20 AM - +263 71 435 1714: No, what are they?
12/2/24, 9:22 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
12/2/24, 9:22 AM - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
12/2/24, 9:30 AM - +263 71 435 1714: Okay, l understand.
12/2/24, 9:31 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms. Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
12/2/24, 9:33 AM - +263 71 435 1714: Well, it's fine.
12/2/24, 9:36 AM - Ananya Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure that will happen after we discuss all our projects in depth (not now), which will mandate us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
12/2/24, 9:39 AM - +263 71 435 1714: Yes,sounds very great
12/2/24, 9:43 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
12/2/24, 9:43 AM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
12/2/24, 9:54 AM - Ananya Edoofa: It's been wonderful getting to know you and having you here. I wish we could have connected for a longer time. However, since our session time is over, let's connect tomorrow at the same time. Have a good day!🌟

12/2/24, 10:00 AM - +263 71 435 1714: I am done reading the newsletter

13/2/24, 8:32 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Blessing!

Let us begin our session with an amazing fact! 

_Did you know that the Arctic Tern holds the record for the longest migration journey of any animal? These remarkable birds travel up to 71,000 kilometers (44,000 miles) round trip every year from their breeding grounds in the Arctic to their wintering grounds in Antarctica and back again. It's an astonishing feat of endurance and navigation!_🐦 <This message was edited>

13/2/24, 8:40 AM - Ananya Edoofa: So may I know which section from the newsletter you *liked the most*, personally for me, it is very difficult to tell, each section has its taste and interest.
13/2/24, 8:46 AM - +263 71 435 1714: I like the first section which contains motivational quotes
13/2/24, 8:48 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨

3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound?
13/2/24, 8:50 AM - +263 71 435 1714: It sounds good and helpful indeed
13/2/24, 8:50 AM - Ananya Edoofa: We’re ready to begin your EWYL program now, and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects you can and will be a part of. Once you’ve gone through it thoroughly- we can discuss your understanding and then help you get started with the projects! Is that clear?
13/2/24, 8:51 AM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
13/2/24, 9:29 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Now that our session time is over, let us discuss this further tomorrow at the same time.

14/2/24, 8:54 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Great! I want you to share your understanding of the document with me. I just want to ensure we don’t miss anything! So, please, go on sharing your understanding of the above document.
14/2/24, 9:03 AM - +263 71 435 1714: I understood that the benefits of being in the program is to to me aware of the job opportunities and what is happening in the business environment surrounding me so as to equip me for my career goals and the destination.l also understood that the major part is squiring the skill to perform the task in line with my aspirations.Futhermore l also learnt about being technology literate so as to move on with the world since many businesses are being done online due to the COVID ISSUES.One should also have a never give up attitude,he should try and try again even if he fails multiple time he should continue trying.
14/2/24, 9:08 AM - +263 71 435 1714: On the project section,it's basically about being able to connect with big companies and convincing them.Even if they treat me rudely l should not quite but l should continue with the project till l finish the task.After connecting with the company l also have to make sure that l link the company with my Seniors so that they communicate and grow in their business.
14/2/24, 9:10 AM - +263 71 435 1714: Generally, the project is more about teaming up and networking.

26/2/24, 8:41 AM - Ananya Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
26/2/24, 8:42 AM - +263 71 435 1714: Well, l am following closely
26/2/24, 8:43 AM - Ananya Edoofa: *Using WhatsApp Community Groups for Outreach:*
*Step 1*: Create a WhatsApp group and name it using the format STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DDMMYYYY. For example, if you're the mentor, it would be *MENTOR NAME/DDMMYYYY*.

*Step 2*: Find the right students for your group to ensure effective communication about Edoofa.

*Purpose*: The goal is to reach a broad audience, providing accurate information about Edoofa to prepare them for a smooth counseling session.
26/2/24, 8:43 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Execution:

*Identify Potential Candidates:* - Reach out to students in Form 6 or those who have recently passed Form 6 (A-Level Examination).

*Connect with Form 6 Divisions*: - Assume there are 3 divisions in Form 6, each with around 20 students. Begin with one division. Connect with these students and request to be added to their official or unofficial WhatsApp group.

*Share Your Group Link*: - Once added, share the link to your created WhatsApp group, explaining that it's an opportunity to pursue education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on tuition fees. Encourage them to join for more details.

*Repeat the Process*: - Move on to the next divisions of Form 6, applying the same approach. In this way, you'll reach at least 60 students (3 divisions of Form 6).

*Extend to Form 5*: - Repeat the process in Form 5, targeting another 60 students.
26/2/24, 8:43 AM - Ananya Edoofa: *Result*:

You would have effectively shared information about Edoofa with a minimum of 120 students, creating awareness and interest among potential applicants. This method ensures a wide reach and prepares students for the upcoming counseling sessions.

26/2/24, 8:43 AM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
26/2/24, 8:49 AM - +263 71 435 1714: After sharing this document should l send the filled document back in the group
26/2/24, 8:51 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Yes, Blessing!
26/2/24, 8:51 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, in order to move ahead with your second project, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
26/2/24, 8:51 AM - Ananya Edoofa: I am ____________, a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in *Zimbabwe*, where tuition fees range from ZWL 650,000 to ZWL 750,000 per term. When considering the yearly cost, including food and accommodation, it exceeds $2,100 in our beloved Zimbabwe⏫

Today, the internet is a necessity, and I truly realized its importance when preparing for my journey to India. We are all well aware of the expenses we have to bear just to access subpar internet services. During my school days, I used to spend a minimum of $35-$40 a month to ensure I had sufficient internet, which added up to around $450-$500 annually.
*It's remarkable to discover that in India, students value their educational infrastructure so much that they can access a necessity like the internet for around $40 for the entire year.*💥
Conversely, when speaking to my seniors in Zimbabwe, I realized that I might have to compromise on my choice of course due to limited available seats. Furthermore, many seniors are struggling with unemployment after graduating in Zimbabwe
I had a strong desire to support my family through part-time employment during my course, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn between $50 and $100 per month throughout the course.
*While pursuing tertiary education in India is more affordable than universities in Zimbabwe, it comes with its own challenges. I diligently followed the 5S, which played a crucial role in helping me qualify for this scholarship. I urge you to go through these Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors will ask you questions based on the information in the flyer I have attached*
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5s of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

26/2/24, 8:52 AM - Ananya Edoofa: To give you an insight about Edoofa, it is a scholarship program initiated by *Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd., INDIA*. Edoofa believes quality education should be accessible to all and not just the privilege of a few. Through our scholarship program that is based on a work-study model, Edoofa solves both problems, that of *lack of affordability and of employability in higher education.* Edoofa stays with the students throughout their academic life as mentor and caretaker, right from building the application, applying to colleges, training, and making them job-ready. This is an experience that I acknowledge as being a Proud Edoofian!🎉
26/2/24, 8:52 AM - Ananya Edoofa: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, Edoofa has worked with 250+ Universities in India and has a community of *more than 3000 students* from different countries📍

26/2/24, 9:12 AM - +263 71 435 1714: It's fine ma'am
26/2/24, 9:13 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Now, it’s been an interesting conversation with you so far. However, I have some cool things left to share and thus, I think we’re ready to move forward. I’m sharing an audio file below which has an easy yet detailed explanation of the last project. So, let’s follow the same process- you hear it more than once, and then recall it quickly for me!
26/2/24, 9:14 AM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
26/2/24, 9:20 AM - +263 71 435 1714: The last project is about Africa's School Education Reformation. l have to connect with local higher education schools principals and tell them about the Edoofa program.l have to tell them why l joined the Edoofa program and it's benefits.After that l have to connect the school's principal with the Edoofa program director.
26/2/24, 9:21 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Now that’s bang-on! I couldn’t have asked anyone to explain it better than you have- so, congratulations. However, I’d still like to ask- are there any questions you have about this project?
26/2/24, 9:23 AM - +263 71 435 1714: No questions so far
26/2/24, 9:23 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Okay, since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how you can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-
1. Give your best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss your EWYL sessions without informing your mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share your challenges and the things you’re good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make your mentor trust you fully
26/2/24, 9:26 AM - +263 71 435 1714: Thank you for the advice ma'am
26/2/24, 9:28 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Now that we will be beginning our new journey. From now onwards we will be having our session on a dedicated EWYL Line. Please save the EWYL Line contact number: +91 98107 89170.
26/2/24, 9:28 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Every day you have to come and say "I am a proud EDOOFIAN' on the EWYL line.
It serves as a link between every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that most of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, "I am a proud Edoofian.
26/2/24, 9:32 AM - +263 71 435 1714: Well.Thank you ma'am.
26/2/24, 9:33 AM - Ananya Edoofa: As we plan for our sessions, you have the flexibility to choose between the following options:

Option 1: Monday and Thursday
Option 2: Tuesday and Friday
Feel free to select the days that best suit your schedule. Following your decision, I will provide you with an updated timetable.

Additionally, every Wednesday, I will share a piece of Wednesday wisdom, and we can discuss it in our subsequent session. Similarly, every Saturday, you will receive your weekend activity, and we will review it in our next session. Both of these components are essential for your evaluation and progress, so ensure their completion.

It's crucial to note that you will only receive your lessons and activities if you follow your EWYL (Every Week, Your Life) ritual consistently. Make it a daily practice, especially in the morning, to ensure timely sharing of activities and lessons.
26/2/24, 9:35 AM - +263 71 435 1714: Let's work with option 1
26/2/24, 9:40 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, by the way, as a team, we are working towards having more efficient sessions, and therefore, we are making a new plan for our students along with a new platform for us.

Therefore, as soon as we finalize the new plan, I will share a new timetable with you. Meanwhile, I want you to keep working on your projects, and if you face any challenges, you can connect with me.
26/2/24, 9:41 AM - +263 71 435 1714: It's alright maam
