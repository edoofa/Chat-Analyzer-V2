2/1/24, 2:27 PM - Ananya Edoofa: As our session comes to a close, I appreciate our time together today. Let's wrap it up and look forward to continuing our discussion tomorrow at the same time. I'm excited to delve into more interesting topics and explore new ideas.

And now, here's a little humor to brighten your day: Why did the computer go to therapy? Because it had too many bytes of emotional baggage! 😄

5/1/24, 9:22 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Anopa!

Now that you have the School Head’s Contact, It is time for us to reach out to the school head in a professional manner. With poor communication, it's easy for messages to get misunderstood. By mastering the professional touch, the potential for misunderstandings occurring can be minimized.
5/1/24, 9:22 AM - Ananya Edoofa: The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career.
5/1/24, 9:25 AM - +263 77 448 2658: Morning Ms. Anopa 's father. Iam happy about the way u are assiting my child. Ithank u so much Madam

THIRD- All our conversations from now on will take forward in the EWYL Line.
5/1/24, 2:21 PM - Ananya Edoofa: The EWYL line contact number is: +91 98107 89170
Please ensure that you connect with me on the EWYL Line every day by saying  'I am a Proud Edoofian'.

It is essential to say this daily as it connects all students, counselors, mentors, and parents associated with Edoofa. Without this, we will not be able to conduct our sessions and may fall behind in terms of earning credits.

"I am a Proud Edoofian" will be considered as your attendance, and we will commence the session only when we receive this message from you.
5/1/24, 2:21 PM - Ananya Edoofa: FOURTH: I want you to drop a message on this EWYL line:

6/1/24, 5:13 AM - +263 78 619 8691: Noble idea that we have a conversation but the major challenge here is very poor network. The underlying fact is that we accept the program you can go ahead share with us what can be done
6/1/24, 5:13 AM - +263 78 619 8691: this was  responded by the headmaster of Chabata High
6/1/24, 1:31 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Anopa!

I wanted to share some exciting news with all of you. As you may have noticed, my schedule has been quite packed lately due to work commitments. The reason behind this is something truly special – our team has organized a three-day long industrial visit called *SLICE CON' 24* for our Indian Edoofians! 🚀

During this event, *we are fortunate to have the Co-founders and CEOs of prominent brands* who will be present and sharing their invaluable *experiences in one-on-one sessions.* Yes, you read that right – they will be there live, right in front of us! What's even more thrilling is that a few of our students are presenting a presentation directly to these CEOs, showcasing why Africa, your homeland, is the best market for their products. 🤝
6/1/24, 1:31 PM - Ananya Edoofa: While I am filled with excitement for this event, please note that due to my involvement in the visit on the *8th, 9th, and 10th of January*, our regular sessions won't be taking place on these days. When we connect on the 11th of January, I'll share my students' experiences and pictures with you. 📸✨

12/1/24, 8:28 AM - +263 78 619 8691: morning Ms
12/1/24, 8:28 AM - +263 78 619 8691: how was the visit
12/1/24, 1:39 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Anopa!

 I want to share a few glimpses of the industrial visit, SLICE CON 24, that took place over the last three days, especially for our Indian Edoofinas! It was so happening, and I am delighted to share that we also welcomed Mr. Peter Hobwani, Deputy Head of Mission and Head of Chancery, Embassy of the Republic of Zimbabwe to India.

Not only that, but we also hosted various industrial leaders, and it went exceptionally well; our students managed to give a presentation in front of them, and they really liked it. Our students also enjoyed the 'Tech Made Easy' sessions, where we taught them to use new-age technological tools, including Artificial Intelligence. The sweetest part was that a few of our students even prepared a surprise performance for us. It was indeed an amazing experience. When you are here in India, we will also connect at such events.

Anopa, guess what? I'm super excited to share some awesome news – next month, we're planning a trip to Africa! 🌍 Yep, you heard it right! Our team is coming to your town. Just like last year, our students will be helping us organize the event, and we're looking for volunteers to join in and help manage everything! 🙌

Trust me, it's going to be an amazing experience with lots to learn! 🌈 Since planning this big event takes proper time and effort, our team will be occupied so tight. Therefore, I was thinking of connecting only once a week for the time being.

Therefore, your new session timing will be *Every Tuesday, 12:00 p.m*. ⏰

Can't wait for this adventure together, see you tomorrow! 🚀

25/1/24, 1:30 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Anopa!

I have some exciting news to share with you. Tomorrow, we are going to celebrate Republic Day! Now, let me tell you a bit about it.

Republic Day is a special day in India. It's a time when we remember and celebrate the day our country adopted its Constitution. Just like a constitution helps guide a country, ours outlines the rules and principles that make India the diverse and vibrant place it is.

On Republic Day, we have a big parade in the capital city, where people from all over the country come together to showcase our culture, traditions, and achievements. It's like a colorful and lively show with music, dance, and different displays. The Indian flag is hoisted, and everyone sings the national anthem with pride.

People also fly kites, dress up in traditional clothes, and enjoy delicious food! 🇮🇳✨

After all, only 6 months are left! So, get ready for this epic adventure, and I'll share the details with you super soon! ⚡

17/2/24, 10:14 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Also, I am sure you must have received your admit card. While we were having multiple conversations with our students in the past few days for the meet & greet event, we figured that there was a slight confusion in the invitation dates. So, I am reaching out to make sure that the same is not the case with you.

* As per the invitation, *you* are supposed to attend the event along with your parents on *the 19th of February* which is on Monday. 
* If you are recommending any of *your friends(Non-Edoofians)* along with their parents to attend the event, as per their choice, the seminar is scheduled for *the 18th of February(8am/1pm) or 19th  February(1pm)*. They should carry a physical copy of their admit cards to enter the event. <This message was edited>
