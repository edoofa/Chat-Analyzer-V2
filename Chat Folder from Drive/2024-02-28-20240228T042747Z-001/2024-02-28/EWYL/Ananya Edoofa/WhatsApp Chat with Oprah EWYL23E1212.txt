_*Did you know that a day on Venus is actually longer than a year on Venus? Even though it only takes Venus about 225 Earth days to go around the sun, it spins really slowly, taking about 243 Earth days to turn once on its axis. So, a day on Venus is longer than a whole year there! 🫨*_

I hope you are all doing great. Well, I understand your concern as a parent, and I truly appreciate how you decided to conduct research of your own rather than listening to someone else. We are based in India, and therefore our office is here. We have been working for about 15 years now, and we have never faced such challenges. However, we still understand that sometimes our students and their parents can face some challenges. Therefore, we have our associates there in your homeland if you want to consult anything.
7/2/24, 8:41 AM - +263 77 216 6243: Mrng l  understand continue with program thanks for helping us

Let us begin our session with a fact about elephants: Did you know that elephants are one of the few animals that can recognize themselves in a mirror? This ability indicates a level of self-awareness that is rare in the animal kingdom and suggests that elephants have a complex understanding of themselves and their surroundings. 🐘
7/2/24, 1:45 PM - +263 71 907 9653: I don't know
7/2/24, 1:49 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Now, before we move forward I would like to know more about you!
Would you like to share a quick introduction?
7/2/24, 1:53 PM - +263 71 907 9653: Okay
7/2/24, 1:54 PM - +263 71 907 9653: I Oprah madziwa a girl aged 19 .l did my A level last year at Nyafaru High in Nyanga and l have got 12 points
7/2/24, 2:00 PM - +263 71 907 9653: I stay in Harare. I am good in calculations mostly .l did pure mathematics ,business studies and accounting  in Alevel and l have got interest in barchelor of commerce.
7/2/24, 2:06 PM - Ananya Edoofa: That's fantastic to hear, Oprah! Your interest in pursuing a Bachelor of Commerce aligns well with your strengths in mathematics, business studies, and accounting. With your solid academic background and enthusiasm for calculations, you're well-positioned to excel in your chosen field.
7/2/24, 2:08 PM - +263 71 907 9653: Okay
7/2/24, 2:18 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
7/2/24, 2:22 PM - +263 71 907 9653: No
7/2/24, 2:29 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
7/2/24, 2:29 PM - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
7/2/24, 2:31 PM - +263 71 907 9653: Okay now it's clear
7/2/24, 3:02 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Now that today's session time is over, let's plan to connect again in our next session, which is tomorrow. Have a good day!🚀
7/2/24, 3:03 PM - +263 71 907 9653: Okay thank you have a good day as well
8/2/24, 1:38 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Oprah!

How are you doing? Are you ready for your session?🚀
8/2/24, 1:38 PM - +263 71 907 9653: Am doing good
8/2/24, 1:38 PM - +263 71 907 9653: Yeah am ready
8/2/24, 1:43 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms. Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
8/2/24, 1:46 PM - +263 71 907 9653: Noted
8/2/24, 1:51 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure that will happen after we discuss all our projects in depth (not now), which will mandate us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
8/2/24, 1:52 PM - +263 71 907 9653: Yeah
8/2/24, 1:55 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
8/2/24, 1:55 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
8/2/24, 2:04 PM - +263 71 907 9653: I read it
8/2/24, 2:06 PM - Ananya Edoofa: So may I know which section from the newsletter you *liked the most*, personally for me, it is very difficult to tell, each section has its taste and interest.
8/2/24, 2:06 PM - +263 71 907 9653: What if am using someone's email am l allowed to change to use my email
8/2/24, 2:07 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Yes, Oprah. Also, don't worry I will also share it with you on whatsapp. <This message was edited>
8/2/24, 2:08 PM - +263 71 907 9653: Edoofa hall of inspiration
8/2/24, 2:08 PM - +263 71 907 9653: It's okay
8/2/24, 2:11 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Well, I am sure you would one day want yourself to be celebrated in this section, the entire Student community reads this newsletter and it's a great deal to be mentioned by the founder himself, isn't it?
8/2/24, 2:15 PM - +263 71 907 9653: That's it
8/2/24, 2:22 PM - Ananya Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!

22/2/24, 2:37 PM - +263 71 907 9653: Okay mentor
22/2/24, 2:47 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, in order to move ahead with your second project, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
22/2/24, 2:47 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I am ____________, a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in *Zimbabwe*, where tuition fees range from ZWL 650,000 to ZWL 750,000 per term. When considering the yearly cost, including food and accommodation, it exceeds $2,100 in our beloved Zimbabwe⏫

Today, the internet is a necessity, and I truly realized its importance when preparing for my journey to India. We are all well aware of the expenses we have to bear just to access subpar internet services. During my school days, I used to spend a minimum of $35-$40 a month to ensure I had sufficient internet, which added up to around $450-$500 annually.
*It's remarkable to discover that in India, students value their educational infrastructure so much that they can access a necessity like the internet for around $40 for the entire year.*💥
Conversely, when speaking to my seniors in Zimbabwe, I realized that I might have to compromise on my choice of course due to limited available seats. Furthermore, many seniors are struggling with unemployment after graduating in Zimbabwe
I had a strong desire to support my family through part-time employment during my course, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn between $50 and $100 per month throughout the course.
*While pursuing tertiary education in India is more affordable than universities in Zimbabwe, it comes with its own challenges. I diligently followed the 5S, which played a crucial role in helping me qualify for this scholarship. I urge you to go through these Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors will ask you questions based on the information in the flyer I have attached*
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5s of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

1. Give your best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss your EWYL sessions without informing your mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share your challenges and the things you’re good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make your mentor trust you fully
