15/1/24, 2:03 PM - +263 77 815 2807: Thank you
15/1/24, 2:04 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Well, I can see that some other people have joined the group besides you. May I learn a little about each of them? I would appreciate it if we could engage in a quick conversation and get to know each other a bit.
15/1/24, 2:06 PM - +263 77 815 2807: They are still at work
15/1/24, 2:06 PM - +263 77 815 2807: @263775088556 is my Father
15/1/24, 2:07 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Alright! Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
15/1/24, 2:31 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Alright! Now let us conclude our session with a motivating quote : 

_Remember, every step forward counts, no matter how small. Embrace the challenges, for they are the stepping stones to success. Keep pushing, stay positive, and watch your journey unfold. You've got this!_🚀
15/1/24, 3:11 PM - +263 77 815 2807: Thank you

16/1/24, 1:45 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Tadiwanashe!

I hope you're all ready for a great session. Let's kick things off with a quick joke to lighten the mood:

Why did the math book look sad? Well, because it had too many problems! 😄
16/1/24, 1:47 PM - +263 77 815 2807: 😂😂😂Afternoon
16/1/24, 1:50 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Let us begin our session by discussing the two objectives!
16/1/24, 1:50 PM - Ananya Edoofa: So, the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
16/1/24, 1:50 PM - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
16/1/24, 2:32 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Now that our session time is over, let us conclude our session here, and remember, every effort you put in is a step closer to success. Keep participating, stay motivated, and earn those credits! You're all doing great, and I look forward to our continued journey together. See you next time!ac

23/1/24, 2:25 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I hope you are aware that our session duration is only one and a half hours. If you join in the latter half of that time, it will be challenging for us to complete our session in a fruitful manner. I trust you understand that attending sessions on time is crucial for earning credits.
I expect a level of sincerity from a dedicated student like you. Moving forward, I hope you will connect with me promptly at 1:30 p.m. in the morning.

25/1/24, 1:37 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Tadiwanashe!

Let us begin our session with a fun fact: 

The tongue of a blue whale, the largest animal on Earth, can weigh as much as an elephant. Despite their massive size, blue whales primarily feed on tiny shrimp-like animals called krill, using their enormous tongues to filter them from the water.🐋
25/1/24, 2:34 PM - Ananya Edoofa: You did not attend the session today as well, however let me highlight that we will continue our conversation on Monday as we do not have our sessions over the weekend. Also, tomorrow, we won't be having our session as it's Republic Day in India. Wishing you a happy Republic Day! It's a special day when we celebrate the adoption of our constitution. People across the country come together for parades, flag hoisting, and cultural events. Looking forward to catching up with you on Monday! Have a wonderful Republic Day celebration!🇮🇳

30/1/24, 1:40 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Tadiwanashe!

How are you doing today? Did you know that the longest river in the world is the Nile River in Africa, stretching over 6,650 kilometers (4,130 miles)?🤔
31/1/24, 8:48 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, @263778152807 @263775088556 

I have observed that you have not been consistent and punctual in attending your sessions. As your mentor, I am concerned about your progress, and I would like you to discuss with me if you are facing any challenges. How will we learn and earn credits if you do not attend the sessions on time?
31/1/24, 8:48 AM - +263 77 815 2807: Good morning. I'm available right now
31/1/24, 8:49 AM - +263 77 815 2807: I apologize for last weeks and I had a headache the last 2 days
31/1/24, 8:53 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Are you feeling better now?
31/1/24, 8:53 AM - +263 77 815 2807: Yes I'm feeling much better now
31/1/24, 8:53 AM - +263 77 815 2807: Ready to kickstart and cover a lot of ground
31/1/24, 8:54 AM - +263 77 815 2807: Even now
31/1/24, 9:08 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Alright! I would also like you to be informed of our program structure that will happen after we discuss all our projects in depth (not now), which will mandate us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
31/1/24, 9:09 AM - +263 77 815 2807: Very interesting
31/1/24, 9:11 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
31/1/24, 9:12 AM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
31/1/24, 9:13 AM - +263 77 815 2807: I'm on it
31/1/24, 9:20 AM - +263 77 815 2807: Done
31/1/24, 9:21 AM - Ananya Edoofa: So may I know which section from the newsletter you *liked the most*, personally for me, it is very difficult to tell, each section has its taste and interest.
31/1/24, 9:28 AM - +263 77 815 2807: The Edoofa hall of inspiration section
31/1/24, 9:29 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Well, I am sure you would one day want yourself to be celebrated in this section, the entire Student community reads this newsletter and it's a great deal to be mentioned by the founder himself, isn't it?
31/1/24, 9:35 AM - +263 77 815 2807: It's a great deal to be honest
31/1/24, 9:36 AM - Ananya Edoofa: We’re ready to begin your EWYL program now, and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects you can and will be a part of. Once you’ve gone through it thoroughly- we can discuss your understanding and then help you get started with the projects! Is that clear?
31/1/24, 9:36 AM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
31/1/24, 9:39 AM - +263 77 815 2807: Yes it's clear
31/1/24, 9:49 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Now that our session time is over, I would appreciate it if you could share your understanding of the above document with me before our next session. This way, we can make the most of our session time.
31/1/24, 9:52 AM - +263 77 815 2807: The document is all about awareness and acquiring certain skill sets. By awareness they mean one knowing whats surrounds himself or herself. It's also alerting one on how jobs in the future will look like and also the skills one should have to be fit for the jobs
31/1/24, 1:40 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Tadiwanashe!

How are you doing? Are you ready to begin our session?🚀

Let us begin our session with an amazing fact! 

_*Did you know that a day on Venus is actually longer than a year on Venus? Even though it only takes Venus about 225 Earth days to go around the sun, it spins really slowly, taking about 243 Earth days to turn once on its axis. So, a day on Venus is longer than a whole year there! 🫨*_
