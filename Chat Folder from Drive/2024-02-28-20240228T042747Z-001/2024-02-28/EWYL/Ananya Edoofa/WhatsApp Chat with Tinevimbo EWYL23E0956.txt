21/2/24, 10:15 AM - Tinashe Zengeya -  Estate Manager ZW: What really impressed me id how the Edoophians are being taken care of. You guys really take good care of the students. From the videos that we saw you just see Students being happy out there.

Also the issue of doing Seminars where they meet enterprenuers and influential people i really liked it and it helps students to plan and have sense of purpose in their lives
21/2/24, 10:28 AM - Ananya Edoofa: It's wonderful to hear that the Meet and Greet '24 conference provided you with valuable insights and reassurance about the authenticity and significance of the Edoofa scholarship. Your enthusiasm and determination to meet all the scholarship requirements are truly commendable, and I have no doubt that you'll achieve your goal of becoming part of India's population by the end of this year.
21/2/24, 10:31 AM - Tinashe Zengeya -  Estate Manager ZW: Thank you
22/2/24, 1:36 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Tinevimbo!

I hope you are doing well, how are you? Are you ready for your session?🚀
22/2/24, 1:45 PM - Tinashe Zengeya -  Estate Manager ZW: Afternoon
22/2/24, 1:45 PM - Tinashe Zengeya -  Estate Manager ZW: How are you
22/2/24, 1:50 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Thank you for asking, I am doing great!
22/2/24, 1:50 PM - Ananya Edoofa: MENTOR - Moving ahead, I'd like to tell you about the *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
22/2/24, 1:51 PM - Tinashe Zengeya -  Estate Manager ZW: Please enlighten me so that we move foward
22/2/24, 1:56 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring that *Tinevimbo* is prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach his/her professional goals.
22/2/24, 1:56 PM - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of the student’s tuition fees.
22/2/24, 1:58 PM - Tinashe Zengeya -  Estate Manager ZW: Thats clear.
22/2/24, 1:58 PM - Tinashe Zengeya -  Estate Manager ZW: Maybe a question here, How competitive are these degrees on the job market especially a case whereby the student wants to come and work here in Zimbabwe?
22/2/24, 1:59 PM - Tinashe Zengeya -  Estate Manager ZW: Do you have students that came back to Zimbabwe and they managed to get jobs easily?
22/2/24, 2:59 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
22/2/24, 2:59 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Now that our session time is over, I want to give you an update that our team is taking off tomorrow and won't have any sessions over the weekend. Let's reconvene and continue our discussions on Monday. Have a nice weekend!
22/2/24, 3:00 PM - Tinashe Zengeya -  Estate Manager ZW: ok
22/2/24, 3:00 PM - Tinashe Zengeya -  Estate Manager ZW: thank you and travel safely

Before we dive into today's session, here's a fun fact about parrots: Did you know that parrots are one of the few animal species that can mimic human speech? Some parrots, like the African grey parrot, have been known to learn hundreds of words and even use them in context! Isn't that amazing?🦜
27/2/24, 1:48 PM - Tinashe Zengeya -  Estate Manager ZW: Amaizing, thanks for this wisdom 😀
27/2/24, 1:49 PM - Tinashe Zengeya -  Estate Manager ZW: Afternoon

27/2/24, 1:53 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure that will happen after we discuss all our projects in depth (not now), which will mandate us to connect a minimum of 2 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
