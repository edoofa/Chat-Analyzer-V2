5/1/24, 1:11 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Tanatswa!

I'm disappointed to see that you missed today's session. It's crucial to be responsible and attend on time. A lack of punctuality affects not just your progress but also the overall effectiveness of our mentoring. Let's take this seriously, and I expect better attendance in the future. Punctuality is a non-negotiable part of our commitment. Ensure you're on time for our next session.
5/1/24, 1:34 PM - +263 78 465 0764: Yes ma'am. I am sorry for missing my session.
7/1/24, 8:48 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good evening!

I wanted to share some exciting news with all of you. As you may have noticed, my schedule has been quite packed lately due to work commitments. The reason behind this is something truly special – our team has organized a three-day long industrial visit called SLICE CON' 24 for our Indian Edoofians! 🚀

During this event, we are fortunate to have the Co-founders and CEOs of prominent brands who will be present and sharing their invaluable experiences in one-on-one sessions. Yes, you read that right – they will be there live, right in front of us! What's even more thrilling is that a few of our students are presenting a presentation directly to these CEOs, showcasing why Africa, your homeland, is the best market for their products. 🤝
7/1/24, 8:48 PM - Ananya Edoofa: While I am filled with excitement for this event, please note that due to my involvement in the visit on the 8th, 9th, and 10th of January, our regular sessions won't be taking place on these days. When we connect on the 11th of January, I'll share my students' experiences and pictures with you. 📸✨
8/1/24, 9:02 PM - +263 78 465 0764: Yes ma'am. That would be delightful indeed
22/1/24, 4:25 PM - Sanjana Edoofa: This message was deleted

Tanatswa, guess what? I'm super excited to share some awesome news – next month, we're planning a trip to Africa! 🌍 Yep, you heard it right! Our team is coming to your town. Just like last year, our students will be helping us organize the event, and we're looking for volunteers to join in and help manage everything! 🙌

Trust me, it's going to be an amazing experience with lots to learn! 🌈 Since planning this big event takes proper time and effort, our team will be occupied so tight. Therefore, I was thinking of connecting only once a week for the time being.

Therefore, your new session timing will be *Every Tuesday, 9:30 a.m*. ⏰

Can't wait for this adventure together, see you tomorrow! 🚀

20/2/24, 1:51 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Hello, Tanatswa!

The past three days flew by in a whirlwind for Team Edoofa – both for those in India and those in Harare for the Meet and Greet '24. Now that we've had a chance to catch our breath, I want to extend my sincere gratitude to you for being a part of the event and contributing to its success.

Your insights from the event are highly valued, and I'm keen to hear about your experience. Would you be open to sharing your thoughts, including your interest in attending similar events in the future and any suggestions for improvement? Additionally, if you have captured any memorable moments in photos, we would greatly appreciate you sharing them.

Your perspective is crucial, and I also encourage you to discuss the event with your parents and gather their feedback.🌟
20/2/24, 2:14 PM - +263 78 465 0764: Good afternoon ma'am. My experience with the Edoofa was a spledid one. I as a student was worried about my stay in India, if the people there are going to interact well with me without racism and discrimination. My doubts were cleared as the Edoofa team shared a video of slicon 24 where students looked more than happy an interactive. A jovial environment was illuminated by the videos and that gave both me and my parents assurance that Edoofa looks beyond a child's education.
26/2/24, 7:40 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good evening, Tanatswa!

I can see a slight delay in our conversation. Actually, I was on a few days off post the event, and that's why  I was not available.
26/2/24, 7:40 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Well, I can feel your excitement buzzing through the screen as you await your ESAT results! Hold onto that anticipation just a bit longer because we're about to drop the big news sometime! 🎉

Mark your calendars for Friday, March 1st – that's when we will be unveiling your results. Get ready to celebrate your achievements and embrace the possibilities that lie ahead! 🌟

Let's keep our fingers crossed! All the best 👍🏻
