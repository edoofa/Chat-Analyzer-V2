5/2/24, 1:33 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, @263772385097 !

Let us begin our session with an amazing fact! 

_*Did you know that a day on Venus is actually longer than a year on Venus? Even though it only takes Venus about 225 Earth days to go around the sun, it spins really slowly, taking about 243 Earth days to turn once on its axis. So, a day on Venus is longer than a whole year there! 🫨*_
5/2/24, 1:34 PM - +263 77 238 5097: Good afternoon madam.
5/2/24, 1:43 PM - Ananya Edoofa: How are you, @263772385097 ?
5/2/24, 1:53 PM - +263 77 238 5097: I am doing well. Hoping you are also fine.
5/2/24, 1:53 PM - +263 77 238 5097: Apologies for not being there on time last week.
5/2/24, 2:00 PM - Ananya Edoofa: That's alright! So,  the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
5/2/24, 2:00 PM - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
5/2/24, 2:05 PM - +263 77 238 5097: I get the point and it seems to be a helpful arrangement.
5/2/24, 2:09 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms. Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
5/2/24, 2:33 PM - +263 77 238 5097: I.am grateful to be in touch with them and waiting to hear from them on the above matters.
5/2/24, 2:35 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Now that our session time is over, let us connect tomorrow at the same time.

Remember, your consistency is the most vital asset for your life. Maintain that if you want to achieve success!
5/2/24, 2:38 PM - +263 77 238 5097: Thank you for the session. I hope we will have a good time again tomorrow without disturbances.
6/2/24, 1:36 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Tanantswa!

How are you doing? Are you ready for your session?🚀
6/2/24, 1:39 PM - +263 77 238 5097: Good afternoon Ananya. I am ready for the session.
6/2/24, 1:46 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Today, I would  like you to be informed of our program structure that will happen after we discuss all our projects in depth (not now), which will mandate us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
6/2/24, 1:49 PM - +263 77 238 5097: Yes it sounds so. Hope to learn a lot from these sessions.
6/2/24, 1:53 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
6/2/24, 1:53 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
6/2/24, 2:15 PM - +263 77 238 5097: Yes ,i have gone through it and learnt something.
6/2/24, 2:21 PM - Ananya Edoofa: So may I know which section from the newsletter you *liked the most*, personally for me, it is very difficult to tell, each section has its taste and interest.
6/2/24, 2:30 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Well, now that our session time is over, let us connect in our next session which is tomorrow at the same time. 🚀
6/2/24, 2:37 PM - +263 77 238 5097: That was great having this session. Lets meet tomorrow.

7/2/24, 1:42 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Let us begin our session with a fact about elephants: Did you know that elephants are one of the few animals that can recognize themselves in a mirror? This ability indicates a level of self-awareness that is rare in the animal kingdom and suggests that elephants have a complex understanding of themselves and their surroundings. 🐘
7/2/24, 2:05 PM - +263 77 238 5097: Amazing in deed.Good afternoon.
7/2/24, 2:15 PM - Ananya Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:

3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound?
7/2/24, 2:22 PM - +263 77 238 5097: That sounds great.With much determination it's possible.
7/2/24, 2:26 PM - Ananya Edoofa: We’re ready to begin your EWYL program now, and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects you can and will be a part of. Once you’ve gone through it thoroughly- we can discuss your understanding and then help you get started with the projects! Is that clear?
7/2/24, 2:27 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
7/2/24, 2:27 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Now that today's session time is over, let's plan to connect again in our next session, which is tomorrow. Have a good day!🚀

8/2/24, 2:01 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Alright. now,  I will start by explaining the projects in detail. I am sharing an audio file with you.

8/2/24, 2:01 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
8/2/24, 2:11 PM - +263 77 238 5097: Right,i am through with the listening.
8/2/24, 2:13 PM - Ananya Edoofa: After you go through this, I would appreciate it if you can briefly summarize your understanding of it.
8/2/24, 2:18 PM - +263 77 238 5097: Yes. I learnt that the first thing is to identify organisations which are dealing with the morden day technology. Then one need to identify the decision makers in those organisations to arrange some meetings with them together with Edoofa to pass the organisation 's mission to them.
8/2/24, 2:24 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I’m happy with your understanding.
8/2/24, 2:24 PM - Ananya Edoofa: So, I am going to share an extremely significant document with you. Read it thoroughly as well as with careful details. I assure you- it’s as important as it sounds.

12/2/24, 1:45 PM - Ananya Edoofa: *Now that we’ve both summarized our understanding of the project, I think we’re ready to move to the next project!* This project is quite possibly a student favorite! So, now I am going to share another audio file and we’ll follow the same process- you ensure you don’t miss anything in it and use this time to play this audio more than once, let’s get to it!
12/2/24, 1:46 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>

You start by telling them about Edoofa then show them some videos. If they show any interest you refer them to Edoofa. Due to the numbers which are received weekly, one can only refer 10 students per week.
12/2/24, 2:11 PM - Ananya Edoofa: That’s awesome ,I’m confident that if you continue to pay attention to the information shared and then respond accordingly, we will make a great team. Now, here are 2 things I’d like  to briefly remind you of from the Community Building Project.

I have observed that you have not been texting me at your session timings; it has always been me who drops a reminder message at your session time. Has your teacher ever dropped a reminder message to you before the class?
13/2/24, 1:56 PM - +263 77 238 5097: Good afternoon. As i have said before, i am Tanatswa ' s father doing the sessions on her behalf because she is at school which is a boarding school with some strict rules which doesn't allow them to have phones.  But I got your point. I will drop the message next time.
13/2/24, 2:36 PM - Ananya Edoofa: That's alright, however now that our session time is over, let us connect tomorrow at the same time. Have a good day ahead!🚀
13/2/24, 2:39 PM - +263 77 238 5097: That's fine. Tomorrow is ok. Good day.
14/2/24, 1:34 PM - +263 77 238 5097: Good afternoon Ananya.
14/2/24, 1:39 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Tanatswa!

How are you doing? Are you ready for the session?🚀
14/2/24, 1:40 PM - +263 77 238 5097: Yes i am ready.
14/2/24, 1:56 PM - Ananya Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
14/2/24, 6:13 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Hi,*Mavis Tanatswa Machokoto*.!

I hope this message finds you well. I apologize for not being able to connect with you yesterday. Unfortunately, I experienced a technical glitch that prevented me from accessing my WhatsApp account. I've managed to restore it this morning.

22/2/24, 1:49 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Now, it’s been an interesting conversation with you so far. However, I have some cool things left to share and thus, I think we’re ready to move forward. I’m sharing an audio file below which has an easy yet detailed explanation of the last project. So, let’s follow the same process- you hear it more than once, and then recall it quickly for me!

Before we dive into today's session, here's a fun fact about parrots: Did you know that parrots are one of the few animal species that can mimic human speech? Some parrots, like the African grey parrot, have been known to learn hundreds of words and even use them in context! Isn't that amazing?🦜
