Along with you, the Edoofa Family will also be occupied in *New Year Celebrations from tomorrow till 1 January 2024* and we will *resume from 2 January onwards*🎉

7/1/24, 8:50 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good evening!

I wanted to share some exciting news with all of you. As you may have noticed, my schedule has been quite packed lately due to work commitments. The reason behind this is something truly special – our team has organized a three-day long industrial visit called SLICE CON' 24 for our Indian Edoofians! 🚀

During this event, we are fortunate to have the Co-founders and CEOs of prominent brands who will be present and sharing their invaluable experiences in one-on-one sessions. Yes, you read that right – they will be there live, right in front of us! What's even more thrilling is that a few of our students are presenting a presentation directly to these CEOs, showcasing why Africa, your homeland, is the best market for their products. 🤝
7/1/24, 8:50 PM - Ananya Edoofa: While I am filled with excitement for this event, please note that due to my involvement in the visit on the 8th, 9th, and 10th of January, our regular sessions won't be taking place on these days. When we connect on the 11th of January, I'll share my students' experiences and pictures with you. 📸✨
11/1/24, 10:10 AM - Ananya Edoofa: A lovely morning to you, Benevolence!

Kindly excuse me for the short delay. I wanted to share a few glimpses of the industrial visit, SLICE CON 24, that was going on for the last three days, especially for our Indian Edoofinas! You know, it was so happening, and I am happy to share that we also welcomed Mr. Peter Hobwani, Deputy Head of Mission and Head of Chancery, Embassy of the Republic of Zimbabwe to India.

Not only this, but we also welcomed various industrial leaders, and it went super well; our students managed to give a presentation in front of them, and they really liked it. Our students also enjoyed the 'Tech made easy' sessions, where we taught them to use new-age technological tools, including Artificial Intelligence. The sweetest part was that a few of our students even prepared a surprise performance for us as well. It was indeed an amazing experience. When you are here in India, we will also connect at such events. <This message was edited>
22/1/24, 4:15 PM - Ananya Edoofa: *_🌟 URGENT UPDATE 🌟_*

Benevolence, guess what? I'm super excited to share some awesome news – next month, we're planning a trip to Africa! 🌍 Yep, you heard it right! Our team is coming to your town. Just like last year, our students will be helping us organize the event, and we're looking for volunteers to join in and help manage everything! 🙌

Trust me, it's going to be an amazing experience with lots to learn! 🌈 Since planning this big event takes proper time and effort, our team will be occupied so tight. Therefore, I was thinking of connecting only once a week for the time being.

Therefore, your new session timing will be *Every Tuesday, 9:30 a.m*. ⏰

Can't wait for this adventure together! 🚀

Well, now is the time! Guess what? I'm super excited to share some awesome news – just like last year, this month, we're planning an annual and exclusive meet & greet in Africa! 🌍🎉 

However, this time it’s different! It’s a mega event that has never happened in the history of Zimbabwe, as we are expecting a crowd of 5000 people! Surprising, isn't it?

Now, we understand that you and your parents must have a lot of questions in your mind as you are in the middle of your University admission process. Therefore, keeping this in mind, along with Mr. Angad, our admissions team, and our counselors will be there as well to address all of your concerns!
1/2/24, 4:06 PM - Ananya Edoofa: So, bring your parents along, and don't miss your chance to expedite your admission process. Not only that, get ready to dive into the opportunities you are going to experience when you are here in India, as Mr. Angad himself is going to walk you through the journey of being an Edoofian. After all, only 6 months are left! So, get ready for this epic adventure, and I'll share the details with you super soon! ⚡

*By the way, we'd like to reserve your seats in advance. Could you please let us know how many people you'll be coming with? This will help us allocate the right number of slots for you.*
7/2/24, 11:18 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Benevolence!

I have been expecting to hear from you for the past couple of days, but I can see you have not been able to get back to me for certain reasons I am unaware of. You see, I have been looking forward to having you at the event as I know how beneficial it will be for you. Most of my students have already quite enthusiastically reserved seats for themselves and their family and friends.

Is everything alright? Are you facing any challenges? Is there something you'd like to share?

I was enjoyed those three days. The event was so fantastic ,I was inspired and got confidence and to be sure that Edoofa is a real thing and also I get to know that EWYL helps to reduce my scholarship credits through watching testimonies from other students like Perseverance Muza.

I was so happy by getting a speech from the founder of Edoofa and told us in detail what is Edoofa and how does it works.

My parents were very happy because they able to have one on one with the team Edoofa and they get positive responses from them which enables them to understand this scholarship.

I am a proud Edoofian!
