5/1/24, 8:59 AM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
6/1/24, 1:29 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Tanyaradzwa!

I wanted to share some exciting news with all of you. As you may have noticed, my schedule has been quite packed lately due to work commitments. The reason behind this is something truly special – our team has organized a three-day long industrial visit called *SLICE CON' 24* for our Indian Edoofians! 🚀

During this event, *we are fortunate to have the Co-founders and CEOs of prominent brands* who will be present and sharing their invaluable *experiences in one-on-one sessions.* Yes, you read that right – they will be there live, right in front of us! What's even more thrilling is that a few of our students are presenting a presentation directly to these CEOs, showcasing why Africa, your homeland, is the best market for their products. 🤝
6/1/24, 1:29 PM - Ananya Edoofa: While I am filled with excitement for this event, please note that due to my involvement in the visit on the *8th, 9th, and 10th of January*, our regular sessions won't be taking place on these days. When we connect on the 11th of January, I'll share my students' experiences and pictures with you. 📸✨
6/1/24, 2:07 PM - +263 78 705 3454: Ok ma'am thank you
11/1/24, 11:26 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Tanyaradzwa!

I hope you are doing well. Kindly excuse me for not connecting with you this morning. Actually, I was sorting out some pictures and videos for you. Let us do one thing, for today let us connect today at 1:30 pm and I will share a lot about our three-day event!

Is that alright?
11/1/24, 1:39 PM - +263 78 705 3454: It's alright ma'am
11/1/24, 1:48 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Before beginning our session, I want to share a few glimpses of the industrial visit, SLICE CON 24, that took place over the last three days, especially for our Indian Edoofinas! It was so happening, and I am delighted to share that we also welcomed Mr. Peter Hobwani, Deputy Head of Mission and Head of Chancery, Embassy of the Republic of Zimbabwe to India.

Not only that, but we also hosted various industrial leaders, and it went exceptionally well; our students managed to give a presentation in front of them, and they really liked it. Our students also enjoyed the 'Tech Made Easy' sessions, where we taught them to use new-age technological tools, including Artificial Intelligence. The sweetest part was that a few of our students even prepared a surprise performance for us. It was indeed an amazing experience. When you are here in India, we will also connect at such events.
11/1/24, 4:05 PM - +263 78 705 3454: It was really good ma'am
12/1/24, 8:35 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Tanyaradzwa!

Let us begin our session with a fact! Did you know that the total weight of ants on Earth is comparable to the total weight of all the humans on this planet? It's a staggering reminder of the incredible diversity and abundance of life around us.🤯🐜
12/1/24, 9:30 AM - Ananya Edoofa: I was hoping to hear from you however since our session time is over, we shall connect in our next session.

15/1/24, 8:36 AM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
15/1/24, 8:54 AM - +263 78 705 3454: Wow
15/1/24, 8:57 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Well,  I am very disappointed to see that you are not showing sincerity towards our EWYL program. You know we specifically allocate slots and time for you, and your non-attendance is truly disappointing and demotivating.

I hope you remember that you have signed a document to ensure your availability for completing the orientation. Although the scheduled time for your orientation has already passed, I have taken it upon myself to extend and complete your orientation. However, it seems like you do not value this opportunity. Can I know the reason behind this? Do you wish to discuss something with me?
15/1/24, 9:01 AM - +263 78 705 3454: Sorry ma'am
The only challenge l have is that my network is not stable so sometimes the massages will deliver when my session time is already over
15/1/24, 9:09 AM - Ananya Edoofa: I understand that; however, I think you need to find a solution for it. Have you tried changing your service provider?
15/1/24, 9:11 AM - +263 78 705 3454: I will try to do it
15/1/24, 9:16 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, now that we’ve both summarized our understanding of the project, I think we’re ready to move to the next project!* This project is quite possibly a student favorite! So, now I am going to share another audio file and we’ll follow the same process- you ensure you don’t miss anything in it and use this time to play this audio more than once.
15/1/24, 9:16 AM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
15/1/24, 9:23 AM - +263 78 705 3454: Ok l will do soo
15/1/24, 9:24 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Okay, so very quickly you summarize whatever you learned in the audio for me? Just so we’re on the same page about it.
15/1/24, 9:34 AM - +263 78 705 3454: This project is for the community building by approaching my school mates ,friends and explain to them about Edoofa program and create the group with them 
I will give them offline application form if they are interested
16/1/24, 8:36 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Tanyaradzwa!

I hope you're all ready for a great session. Let's kick things off with a quick joke to lighten the mood:

Why did the math book look sad? Well, because it had too many problems! 😄
16/1/24, 8:57 AM - +263 78 705 3454: 😆
16/1/24, 8:57 AM - +263 78 705 3454: Morning ma'am
16/1/24, 9:01 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, Back to the exciting part- your *Scholarship Credits*. So, here’s a quick recap of what’s the opportunity for you here-
 1. For every student that enrolls in our Edoofa Program and pays the first part of the enrolment fee, you will be awarded *$20 worth of Scholarship credits*.
2. Similarly, upon completing the Admission Formalities of the university à you will be awarded *$30 worth of Scholarship credits*.

Let us begin our session with a fun fact: 

The tongue of a blue whale, the largest animal on Earth, can weigh as much as an elephant. Despite their massive size, blue whales primarily feed on tiny shrimp-like animals called krill, using their enormous tongues to filter them from the water.🐋

26/2/24, 9:43 AM - Ananya Edoofa: You know, I have an amazing session planned for you along with some targets for this month. However, I am quite disappointed that you did not attend your session. Can I know the reason behind this?
