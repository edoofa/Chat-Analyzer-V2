 So, to kick things off with a bang, I wanted to share a fantastic video with you that I think will help us connect on a deeper level. Get ready to be inspired!
6/1/24, 12:45 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
6/1/24, 2:03 PM - +263 77 304 7944: Thank you Ms Ananya
10/1/24, 11:13 AM - +263 77 794 4385: Hello Ms Ananya
11/1/24, 12:36 PM - +263 77 794 4385: Hello Ms Ananya
11/1/24, 1:48 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Emily!

Before beginning our session, I want to share a few glimpses of the industrial visit, SLICE CON 24, that took place over the last three days, especially for our Indian Edoofinas! It was so happening, and I am delighted to share that we also welcomed Mr. Peter Hobwani, Deputy Head of Mission and Head of Chancery, Embassy of the Republic of Zimbabwe to India.

Not only that, but we also hosted various industrial leaders, and it went exceptionally well; our students managed to give a presentation in front of them, and they really liked it. Our students also enjoyed the 'Tech Made Easy' sessions, where we taught them to use new-age technological tools, including Artificial Intelligence. The sweetest part was that a few of our students even prepared a surprise performance for us. It was indeed an amazing experience. When you are here in India, we will also connect at such events.
11/1/24, 2:48 PM - +263 77 794 4385: Ok that is great
11/1/24, 2:56 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Now, since our session time is over, we shall connect in our next session.

Remember that your consistency is something that will make you achieve heights! So always attend your session on time, and trust me, no one can stop you from earning credits!

Therefore, good luck, and see you tomorrow!
11/1/24, 2:58 PM - +263 77 794 4385: Ok thank you
12/1/24, 1:30 PM - +263 77 794 4385: Hello Ms Ananya
12/1/24, 1:33 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Emily!

Let us begin our session with a fact! Did you know that the total weight of ants on Earth is comparable to the total weight of all the humans on this planet? It's a staggering reminder of the incredible diversity and abundance of life around us.🤯🐜
12/1/24, 1:36 PM - +263 77 794 4385: Wow that's so awesome
12/1/24, 1:58 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
12/1/24, 2:01 PM - +263 77 794 4385: Yes
12/1/24, 2:05 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals. <This message was edited>
12/1/24, 2:05 PM - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
12/1/24, 2:08 PM - +263 77 794 4385: Noted
12/1/24, 2:09 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms. Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
12/1/24, 2:11 PM - +263 77 794 4385: Nice meeting them
12/1/24, 2:15 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure that will happen after we discuss all our projects in depth (not now), which will mandate us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
12/1/24, 2:18 PM - +263 77 794 4385: Yah very interesting
12/1/24, 2:20 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
12/1/24, 2:20 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
12/1/24, 2:32 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Now that our session time is over, we shall connect in our next session. Since we don't have sessions over the weekend, let's reconnect on Monday. See you then!🚀

15/1/24, 2:33 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Well, I was hoping to hear from your end. May I know if you are facing any challenges?
16/1/24, 10:45 AM - +263 77 794 4385: I was facing data challenges as my schools wifi was turned off
16/1/24, 1:42 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon,Emily!

I hope you're all ready for a great session. Let's kick things off with a quick joke to lighten the mood:

Why did the math book look sad? Well, because it had too many problems! 😄
18/1/24, 1:35 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Emily

Kindly excuse me for not being able to connect with you yesterday. Unfortunately, due to bad health, I had to take a day off.
18/1/24, 1:56 PM - +263 77 304 7944: How are you feeling today
18/1/24, 2:01 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I am feeling better, Emily! <This message was edited>
18/1/24, 2:02 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Emily, I have noticed that you've been a bit irregular lately. May I ask if everything is alright?
18/1/24, 2:06 PM - +263 77 304 7944: I am at school so at times I will be in class
18/1/24, 2:11 PM - Ananya Edoofa: While I understand and appreciate that you are working to finance your education, it is crucial for you to finish your EWYL orientation with me, as mentioned earlier. If you are not able to do that, you can ask your parents to attend the session with me and understand the basics of the program.

This will ensure a smooth process, and we can later connect on the projects only. Please let me know if you proceed in this manner.
18/1/24, 2:12 PM - +263 77 304 7944: Okay ma'am
18/1/24, 2:25 PM - Ananya Edoofa: So, may I ask if your parents are going to join in? <This message was edited>
18/1/24, 2:42 PM - +263 77 304 7944: Yes they will join in tomorrow
19/1/24, 1:34 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon,  Emily!

23/1/24, 2:25 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I hope you are aware that our session duration is only one and a half hours. If you join in the latter half of that time, it will be challenging for us to complete our session in a fruitful manner. I trust you understand that attending sessions on time is crucial for earning credits.
I expect a level of sincerity from a dedicated student like you. Moving forward, I hope you will connect with me promptly at 1:30 a.m. in the morning.

Because they make up everything!

Thank you all for a great session. Remember, laughter is the best medicine. Until next time!🚀
25/1/24, 1:36 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Emily!

Let us begin our session with a fun fact: 

The tongue of a blue whale, the largest animal on Earth, can weigh as much as an elephant. Despite their massive size, blue whales primarily feed on tiny shrimp-like animals called krill, using their enormous tongues to filter them from the water.🐋
25/1/24, 1:41 PM - +263 77 794 4385: Good afternoon

3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound?
25/1/24, 1:59 PM - +263 77 794 4385: It sounds wonderful
25/1/24, 2:03 PM - Ananya Edoofa: We’re ready to begin your EWYL program now, and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects you can and will be a part of.

_*Did you know that a day on Venus is actually longer than a year on Venus? Even though it only takes Venus about 225 Earth days to go around the sun, it spins really slowly, taking about 243 Earth days to turn once on its axis. So, a day on Venus is longer than a whole year there! 🫨*_

Greetings Dear Educationists 
Hope you are doing well!

I am *Emily Mufaro Sengai , an Eddooofian, at Edoofa*.  I am student at Gutu High school but I have successfully enrolled with Edoofa. 
I would like to extend this  opportunity to all deserving students at your school.  After assessing and understanding the Edoofa Scholarship Program that has been in existence for the past 14 years I have found it deserving for you to grant your students and parents to partner with Edoofa.
We can  plan an interactive session with parents and students where we will delve into the details of the Edoofa Scholarship Program and explore all aspects of this program. Get ready to embark on a transformative journey with Edoofa, where we believe in unlocking the full potential of every student and paving the way for a bright and successful future. I believe you  will join on time.
9/2/24, 2:08 PM - +263 77 304 7944: Answer 3

Gutu High School is in Masvingo Province
9/2/24, 2:30 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I would like you to connect with other School Heads. I will be guiding you at every point in this process. Our main aim through this will be to bring the privilege that Edoofa provides to all other fellow school students as well.
9/2/24, 2:32 PM - +263 77 304 7944: My mom is teacher in one of the schools in Harare so is it possible also to talk the Head
9/2/24, 2:48 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Yes, that would be great!
9/2/24, 2:50 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Also, we’ve come to the end of one part of your onboarding of EWYL. So, I want you to go through this conversation quickly- and highlight any areas, questions, or projects that you may have even the slightest concern with- and let’s resolve them before we move on!
12/2/24, 1:34 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Emily!

How was your weekend? Are you ready for your session?🚀
12/2/24, 1:34 PM - +263 77 304 7944: Yes
12/2/24, 1:42 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Well,  since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how you can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-
1. Give your best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss your EWYL sessions without informing your mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share your challenges and the things you’re good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make your mentor trust you fully
12/2/24, 1:44 PM - +263 77 304 7944: Noted
12/2/24, 1:51 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Now that we will be beginning our new journey. From now onwards we will be having our session on a dedicated EWYL Line. Please save the EWYL Line contact number: +91 98107 89170.

Every day you have to come and say "I am a proud EDOOFIAN' on the EWYL line.
It serves as a link between every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers.
12/2/24, 1:51 PM - Ananya Edoofa: It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that most of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, "I am a proud Edoofian.
12/2/24, 2:07 PM - +263 77 304 7944: That will be great
12/2/24, 2:11 PM - Ananya Edoofa: As we plan for our sessions, you have the flexibility to choose between the following options:

Option 1: Monday and Thursday
Option 2: Tuesday and Friday
Feel free to select the days that best suit your schedule. Following your decision, I will provide you with an updated timetable.

Additionally, every Wednesday, I will share a piece of Wednesday wisdom, and we can discuss it in our subsequent session. Similarly, every Saturday, you will receive your weekend activity, and we will review it in our next session. Both of these components are essential for your evaluation and progress, so ensure their completion.

It's crucial to note that you will only receive your lessons and activities if you follow your EWYL (Every Week, Your Life) ritual consistently. Make it a daily practice, especially in the morning, to ensure timely sharing of activities and lessons.
12/2/24, 3:19 PM - +263 77 304 7944: Monday and Thursday
12/2/24, 3:38 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Now, we are ready to begin our new journey! Before that, I'm super excited to share some awesome news – next month, we're planning a trip to Africa! 🌍 Yep, you heard it right! Our team is coming to your town. Just like last year, our students will be helping us organize the event, and we're looking for volunteers to join in and help manage everything! 🙌

Trust me, it will be an amazing experience with lots to learn! 🌈 Since planning this big event takes time and effort, our team will be so tight. 

Because of this, I'm proposing a slight adjustment to our session timetable. As of now, we won't be having our session as initially planned. However, worry not! I will soon share an updated timetable. Meanwhile, you can keep working on your targets and keep me posted on your EWYL group.
