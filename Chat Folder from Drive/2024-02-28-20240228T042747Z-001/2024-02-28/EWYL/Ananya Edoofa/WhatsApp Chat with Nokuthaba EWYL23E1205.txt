28/1/24, 8:47 PM - +263 78 751 4112: Good evening maam her are my forms for students that i have discussed with about Edoofa
29/1/24, 1:40 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Nokuthaba!

How are you? I'm a bit surprised to see progress on the projects. We haven't even started working together yet!
29/1/24, 1:49 PM - +263 78 751 4112: Afternoon ma'am. I am good and you
30/1/24, 1:35 PM - +263 78 751 4112: Good afternoon ma'am,  l am ready for today's session.
30/1/24, 1:36 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Nokuthaba!

How are you doing? Did you know that the longest river in the world is the Nile River in Africa, stretching over 6,650 kilometers (4,130 miles)?🤔
30/1/24, 1:37 PM - +263 78 751 4112: I am good thank you and how are you. I did not know that.Thats intresting.
30/1/24, 1:48 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Now, before we move forward I would like to know more about you!
Would you like to share a quick introduction?
30/1/24, 1:50 PM - +263 78 751 4112: My name is a Nokuthaba Anita Ncube. I am a Christian and I love to play tennis. My favorite tennis player is Serena Williams. In 5years time I see myself achieving my masters in Sociology. My goal in life is to be able to actually help and be an inspiration to the girl child and every child nationwide. I am a very free-spirited person which helps me to interact with people and makes people comfortable with me. I have sympathy which enables me to be remorseful for the most part it is a good thing as I feel to help people. <This message was edited>
30/1/24, 2:07 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Nice to meet you! 🌟 That's awesome that you're into tennis. Serena Williams is a legend! 🎾 And aiming for a master's in Sociology in 5 years – that's some serious ambition. 📚 Your goal of helping and inspiring the girl child is truly admirable. Keep that free-spirited vibe going, it's a superpower! 🌈 Sympathy is a beautiful quality, and using it to help others is incredible. 💖
30/1/24, 2:09 PM - +263 78 751 4112: Indeed Serena Williams is a legend. Thank you so much for the motivational words maam.
30/1/24, 2:13 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
30/1/24, 2:14 PM - +263 78 751 4112: No maam i dont understand the two objectives.
30/1/24, 2:20 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
30/1/24, 2:20 PM - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
30/1/24, 2:22 PM - +263 78 751 4112: Yes maam i have understood
30/1/24, 2:27 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure that will happen after we discuss all our projects in depth (not now), which will mandate us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
30/1/24, 2:29 PM - +263 78 751 4112: Yes, it sounds intresting.
30/1/24, 2:41 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
30/1/24, 2:41 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
30/1/24, 2:51 PM - +263 78 751 4112: The newsletter got me motivated and encouraged. I also gained a lot from the newsletter. Thank you ma'am.
30/1/24, 3:08 PM - +263 78 751 4112: I  am done reading the newsletter maam
30/1/24, 3:10 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Now that our session time is over, let us connect in our next session which is tomorrow at the same time.
30/1/24, 3:11 PM - +263 78 751 4112: Noted ma'am, thank you for today's session
31/1/24, 1:39 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Nokuthaba!

How are you doing? Are you ready to begin our session?🚀 <This message was edited>
31/1/24, 1:43 PM - +263 78 751 4112: Afternoon ma'am, Yes im ready for today's session
31/1/24, 1:56 PM - Ananya Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound?
31/1/24, 1:58 PM - +263 78 751 4112: It sounds amazing.
31/1/24, 2:02 PM - Ananya Edoofa: We’re ready to begin your EWYL program now, and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects you can and will be a part of. Once you’ve gone through it thoroughly- we can discuss your understanding and then help you get started with the projects! Is that clear?
31/1/24, 2:02 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
31/1/24, 2:03 PM - +263 78 751 4112: Yes, ma'am it's clear.
31/1/24, 2:04 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I want you to share your understanding of the document with me. I just want to ensure we don’t miss anything! So, please, go on sharing your understanding of the above document.
31/1/24, 2:27 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Now that our session time is over, we will connect in our next session which is tomorrow at the same time.
31/1/24, 2:28 PM - +263 78 751 4112: Noted maam
31/1/24, 2:28 PM - +263 78 751 4112: Noted maam i was still going through the document.
31/1/24, 2:56 PM - +263 78 751 4112: From the document, I understood that the EWYL Program is a program that is aimed at providing higher education, which is accessible, and affordable and helps an individual to achieve his or her career goals and work towards preparing every Edoofian for the 21st century. Several stages are undertaken for l to earn credits these include Corporate alliances, Community building, and African schools' education reform mission.
1/2/24, 1:35 PM - +263 78 751 4112: Good afternoon maam I am ready for my today session
1/2/24, 1:42 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Nokuthaba!

How are you doing? Let us begin our session with a small joke; Why don't skeletons fight each other?

They don't have the guts!😅
1/2/24, 1:44 PM - +263 78 751 4112: Afternoon maam, I always wander instead they should be vibing😂
1/2/24, 1:51 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Haha, yes!
1/2/24, 1:52 PM - +263 78 751 4112: Its unbelievable
1/2/24, 1:55 PM - +263 78 751 4112: I read the docent ma'am and I understood
1/2/24, 1:57 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Well, i saw your response and you have done a great job!
1/2/24, 1:57 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I will start by explaining the projects in detail. I am sharing an audio file with you. Here’s my suggestion- listen to it at least twice, you know- to make sure we don’t miss anything out, and then get back to me when you are finished with the process!
1/2/24, 1:57 PM - Ananya Edoofa: This message was deleted
1/2/24, 1:57 PM - +263 78 751 4112: noted maam
1/2/24, 1:57 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
1/2/24, 2:02 PM - +263 78 751 4112: i have listened to the audio maam <This message was edited>
1/2/24, 2:09 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Okay, so very quickly you summarize whatever you learned in the audio for me? Just so we’re on the same page about it.
1/2/24, 2:17 PM - +263 78 751 4112: From the audio, I learnt that the project needs me to understand the market that I am going to work in. I also have to do good research about the market and understand the information that I want to work under and find them on the internet, l need to also ask relatives to help  me gather information. I need to identify decision-makers who work with these organizations and reach out to them. I also have to create a linked account and have the decision makers' contacts for me to create an appointment.
1/2/24, 2:29 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I know that we could not have a fruitful session today because I was occupied with planning and preparing for our Africa trip. However, tomorrow we will have a fruitful session as usual, so be there on time!🚀
1/2/24, 2:32 PM - +263 78 751 4112: Yes ma'am

_*Did you know that a day on Venus is actually longer than a year on Venus? Even though it only takes Venus about 225 Earth days to go around the sun, it spins really slowly, taking about 243 Earth days to turn once on its axis. So, a day on Venus is longer than a whole year there! 🫨*_
5/2/24, 1:48 PM - +263 78 751 4112: I never knew that

5/2/24, 2:04 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Now, Let me help you with the kind of communication that you should do with the school heads, okay?

Q1. Please mention the name of your school. Is your school connected with Edoofa?
Q2. Please share the messages that you will use when you reach out to the School Heads.
Q3. Name of the Province where your school is located.
5/2/24, 2:07 PM - +263 78 751 4112: 1.Khumbula high school, no it is not connected with Edoofa.                         2. For the moment I had not yet sent any message it was face to face conversations.                                                                                        3.

5/2/24, 2:12 PM - +263 78 751 4112: 2.  Please help  with message that I need to share.
5/2/24, 2:14 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Great! Well, as per our records, your school is not connected with us. And Voila! You can therefore connect with your own school and earn credits at an initial stage!
5/2/24, 2:16 PM - +263 78 751 4112: Noted ma'am
5/2/24, 2:18 PM - +263 78 751 4112: I went for feedback at Eveline high, they said it's a Government school and it's hard for them to realise such information when filling the form and they asked for your number and I have them yours. Was I right ma'am  by doing that
5/2/24, 2:23 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Nokuthaba, you always have to ask the school to fill out the form. This way, I will be able to set a meeting with them.
5/2/24, 2:24 PM - +263 78 751 4112: Ma'am they refused to do so as they said it's a Government school they are not allowed to write their passrate in public
5/2/24, 2:25 PM - +263 78 751 4112: Ma'am may you  please assit <This message was edited>
5/2/24, 2:33 PM - Ananya Edoofa: _So, This is what the First message should look like:_

May I know at what time you will be available to connect via Whatsapp?
5/2/24, 2:33 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Now that our session time is over, let us connect tomorrow at the same time.

Remember, your consistency is the most vital asset for your life. Maintain that if you want to achieve success!

6/2/24, 1:36 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Nokuthaba!

How are you doing? Are you ready for your session?🚀
6/2/24, 1:37 PM - +263 78 751 4112: Good afternoon ma'am,  l am blessed and you. Yes I am ready for today's session
6/2/24, 1:46 PM - Ananya Edoofa: now, we’ve come to the end of one part of your onboarding of EWYL. So, I want you to go through this conversation quickly- and highlight any areas, questions, or projects that you may have even the slightest concern with- and let’s resolve them before we move on!
6/2/24, 1:54 PM - +263 78 751 4112: Ma'am, l have no questions so far we can continue
6/2/24, 1:54 PM - Ananya Edoofa: So, since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how you can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-
1. Give your best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss your EWYL sessions without informing your mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share your challenges and the things you’re good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make your mentor trust you fully
6/2/24, 1:56 PM - +263 78 751 4112: I never knew that I can also do someating on social media for my EWYL program
6/2/24, 1:56 PM - +263 78 751 4112: Noted ma'am
6/2/24, 1:58 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Now that we will be beginning our new journey. From now onwards we will be having our session on a dedicated EWYL Line. Please save the EWYL Line contact number: +91 98107 89170.
6/2/24, 1:58 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Every day you have to come and say "I am a proud EDOOFIAN' on the EWYL line.
It serves as a link between every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers.
6/2/24, 1:58 PM - Ananya Edoofa: It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that most of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, "I am a proud Edoofian.
6/2/24, 2:02 PM - +263 78 751 4112: I am a proud Edoofian
6/2/24, 2:05 PM - Ananya Edoofa: You have to do it on this number, Nokuthaba!
6/2/24, 2:05 PM - +263 78 751 4112: I  have saved ma'am
6/2/24, 2:06 PM - Ananya Edoofa: As we plan for our sessions, you have the flexibility to choose between the following options:

Option 1: Monday and Thursday
Option 2: Tuesday and Friday
Feel free to select the days that best suit your schedule. Following your decision, I will provide you with an updated timetable.

Additionally, every Wednesday, I will share a piece of Wednesday wisdom, and we can discuss it in our subsequent session. Similarly, every Saturday, you will receive your weekend activity, and we will review it in our next session. Both of these components are essential for your evaluation and progress, so ensure their completion.

It's crucial to note that you will only receive your lessons and activities if you follow your EWYL (Every Week, Your Life) ritual consistently. Make it a daily practice, especially in the morning, to ensure timely sharing of activities and lessons.
6/2/24, 2:08 PM - +263 78 751 4112: Tuesday and Friday
6/2/24, 2:11 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, Nokuthaba!
