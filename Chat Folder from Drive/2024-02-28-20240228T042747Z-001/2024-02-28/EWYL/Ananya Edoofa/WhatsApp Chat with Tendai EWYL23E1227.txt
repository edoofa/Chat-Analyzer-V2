2/2/24, 2:36 PM - +263 78 786 4935: Not sure
2/2/24, 2:57 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Well, it was nice connecting with you today. I wish we could talk a bit more; however, since our session time is over, let's connect on Monday as we don't have sessions over the weekend!

Happy weekend!🚀
2/2/24, 2:58 PM - +263 78 786 4935: Thank you
5/2/24, 1:30 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Tendai!

Let us begin our session with an amazing fact! 

_*Did you know that a day on Venus is actually longer than a year on Venus? Even though it only takes Venus about 225 Earth days to go around the sun, it spins really slowly, taking about 243 Earth days to turn once on its axis. So, a day on Venus is longer than a whole year there! 🫨*_
5/2/24, 1:32 PM - +263 78 786 4935: A good afternoon to you,  Mrs Ananya are we yet to start our session
5/2/24, 1:33 PM - +263 78 786 4935: Intressting..
5/2/24, 1:40 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Indeed, Now, let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals. <This message was edited>
5/2/24, 1:40 PM - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
5/2/24, 1:42 PM - +263 78 786 4935: Oky
5/2/24, 1:48 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms. Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
5/2/24, 1:52 PM - +263 78 786 4935: Understood,  
Greetings Ms Dava and Ms Sanjana, 
That's if they available
5/2/24, 1:59 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure that will happen after we discuss all our projects in depth (not now), which will mandate us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
5/2/24, 2:02 PM - +263 78 786 4935: Yes
5/2/24, 2:08 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
5/2/24, 2:08 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
5/2/24, 2:18 PM - +263 78 786 4935: Am done
5/2/24, 2:21 PM - Ananya Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound?
5/2/24, 2:23 PM - +263 78 786 4935: Sounds great,  thank you a lot
5/2/24, 2:31 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
6/2/24, 10:00 AM - +263 78 786 4935: Good morning Mrs Ananya. As for my understandings about the document you sent me yesterday, the document enlighten us on how to be always aware, the skills we need to have to secure the jobs of the future and also introduce three projects a Edoofian can do to earn scholarship credits. As for the skills,  it mentioned new skills imagining in this current century,  which include Online skills and Social media literacy, Creative content writing, Data analysis and Remote team-work. It also mention basic skills which do not expire,  for example Relationship building, Risk-taking, Decision making and Empathy. 
The first project mentioned on the document which is Corporate Alliances,  talks about investigating on companies or organizations and connecting them with Edoofa. The second project is about connecting with people to give them an insight and an opportunity to be part of a bigger family, Edoofa.  As we all agree every one should be given an opportunity to better education. The third project is connecting with schools and introducing Edoofa to them,  and connecting them to the Edoofa.

It warns us on what should be put into consideration when selecting the right type of companies to associate with. What should be put into consideration includes the nature of the company, scale of company, financial stability and background of the founder. The document also give us insight on how to go through the process,  this includes how to use platforms like Google, Linkedlin,  crunchbase and lntershala to search for companies.

7/2/24, 1:39 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Tendai!

Let us begin our session with a fact about elephants: Did you know that elephants are one of the few animals that can recognize themselves in a mirror? This ability indicates a level of self-awareness that is rare in the animal kingdom and suggests that elephants have a complex understanding of themselves and their surroundings. 🐘

 1. For every student that enrolls in our Edoofa Program and pays the first part of the enrolment fee, you will be awarded *$20 worth of Scholarship credits*.
2. Similarly, upon completing the Admission Formalities of the university à you will be awarded *$30 worth of Scholarship credits*.
3. There is an additional opportunity to earn $5 worth of Scholarship credits by connecting with students to provide clarity to them about the Edoofa Scholarship, which the Edoofa team will share with you!
8/2/24, 1:51 PM - +263 78 786 4935: Sounds great
8/2/24, 1:53 PM - Ananya Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
8/2/24, 1:55 PM - Ananya Edoofa: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*

*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED*
8/2/24, 1:55 PM - Ananya Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
8/2/24, 1:55 PM - Ananya Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)
8/2/24, 1:55 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Once they add you there, you can share the link to YOUR WhatsApp Group (that you created in the first step) and tell them that on that group you will be sharing information about an exciting opportunity where they get a chance to pursue your education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on the tuition fee. To know more, please get added to the group.
8/2/24, 1:55 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
8/2/24, 1:55 PM - Ananya Edoofa: 2] ADD MENTOR:

Make sure that before you start interacting with the participants in the group that you created for the community-building project, YOU ADD ME.

The purpose of doing this is that:
- I will be able to track your progress and guide you through learning the networking skill
- I will be able to see the concerns raised by students and we can discuss them accordingly.
- I will be able to see whether the right information has been shared with all the students

8/2/24, 2:03 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Let me introduce you to the scholarship program that is providing me an opportunity to fulfill all my dreams related to higher education - EDOOFA -Education For All.
8/2/24, 2:03 PM - Ananya Edoofa: To give you an insight about Edoofa, it is a scholarship program initiated by *Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd., INDIA*. Edoofa believes quality education should be accessible to all and not just the privilege of a few. Through our scholarship program that is based on a work-study model, Edoofa solves both problems, that of *lack of affordability and of employability in higher education.* Edoofa stays with the students throughout their academic life as mentor and caretaker, right from building the application, applying to colleges, training, and making them job-ready. This is an experience that I acknowledge as being a Proud Edoofian!🎉
8/2/24, 2:03 PM - Ananya Edoofa: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, Edoofa has worked with 250+ Universities in India and has a community of *more than 3000 students* from different countries📍
8/2/24, 2:03 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Edoofa receives applications from _South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries_. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 2100 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just *affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven* so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains
8/2/24, 2:03 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I would like each one of you to take a look at the video that I am sharing below. The video is regarding Edoofa’s Meet and Greet session where Edoofa’s founders Mr. Angad Singh and Mr. Avreen Singh interacted with various School Principals, African students, and their parents in Harare, Zimbabwe last year.
Please have a look at it and share your thoughts with me.

How was your weekend? Are you ready for your session?🚀
13/2/24, 1:39 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good evening, @263787864935 @263774326053 @263785998992 
It has been observed that you have not been attending your sessions lately. I am quite disappointed by witnessing your unavailability during the sessions.

I hope you are aware that you have signed a document committing to your orientation within a set time frame. May I ask if there is something that you would like to share with me?
13/2/24, 2:21 PM - +263 78 786 4935: Afternoon  Mrs Ananya,  am very sorry for not being able to attend the sessions yesterday and today, we have been experiencing a blackout at our home stand so our  devices  were off,  l hope you will find it easy to understand and forgive us.
13/2/24, 2:35 PM - Ananya Edoofa: That's alright, however now that our session time is over, let us connect tomorrow at the same time. Have a good day ahead!🚀
14/2/24, 1:31 PM - +263 78 786 4935: Good afternoon
14/2/24, 1:41 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Tendai!

How are you doing? Are you ready for the session?🚀
14/2/24, 1:41 PM - +263 78 786 4935: Yes
14/2/24, 1:51 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Now, Let me help you with the kind of communication that you should do with the school heads, okay?



Before we start, I want you to answer the questions that I am sharing below:
Q1. Please mention the name of your school. Is your school connected with Edoofa?
Q2. Please share the messages that you will use when you reach out to the School Heads.
Q3. Name of the Province where your school is located.
14/2/24, 1:54 PM - +263 78 786 4935: 1, Buhera high school,,  not connected with Edoofa
14/2/24, 2:06 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Great! Well, as per our records, your school is not connected with us. And Voila! You can therefore connect with your own school and earn credits at an initial stage!
14/2/24, 2:08 PM - +263 78 786 4935: 2, Greetings Mr _*name of head*_ my name is Tendai Zebediah Kativhu,  am a former student of your school. I was given the privilege to be part of a life changing program called Edoofa which offers international scholarships. Being part of this program enabled my higher education to be much cheaper and also gave me the oppunity to study abroad. I have been wondering, if you are willing well can also introduce the program to help my brothers and sisters there.  If you are willing to help,  l can arrange a meeting between you and the  some people in the program according to your own free time.  Just say the date and time and l will make it happen,  if you have any questions just ask.
14/2/24, 2:16 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Great!May I know if you have the other School Head’s Whatsapp Contact?
14/2/24, 2:19 PM - +263 78 786 4935: I have only the contact of the head form my previous school,,  don't have other contacts for heads from other schools but am working on that.
14/2/24, 2:20 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Now that you have the School Head’s Contact, It is time for us to reach out to the school head in a professional manner. With poor communication, it's easy for messages to get misunderstood. By mastering the professional touch, the potential for misunderstandings occurring can be minimized.
14/2/24, 2:20 PM - Ananya Edoofa: The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career.
14/2/24, 2:20 PM - Ananya Edoofa: This message was deleted
14/2/24, 2:21 PM - +263 78 786 4935: Oky understood

Let us begin our session with an interesting fact: _Africa is home to the world's largest land mammal - the African elephant. These majestic creatures can weigh up to 6 metric tons (approximately 13,000 pounds) and are known for their intelligence, complex social structures, and remarkable memory. Isn't that incredible?_
21/2/24, 1:33 PM - +263 78 786 4935: Afternoon Mrs Ananya,,  that's indeed intressting
21/2/24, 1:39 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Now, that we’ve come to the end of one part of your onboarding of EWYL. So, I want you to go through this conversation quickly- and highlight any areas, questions, or projects that you may have even the slightest concern with- and let’s resolve them before we move on!
21/2/24, 1:43 PM - +263 78 786 4935: I think the projects are quite clear
21/2/24, 1:46 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Great! Now, since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how you can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-
1. Give your best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss your EWYL sessions without informing your mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share your challenges and the things you’re good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make your mentor trust you fully
21/2/24, 1:47 PM - +263 78 786 4935: Noted
21/2/24, 1:50 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Now that we will be beginning our new journey. From now onwards we will be having our session on a dedicated EWYL Line. Please save the EWYL Line contact number: +91 98107 89170.

Every day you have to come and say "I am a proud EDOOFIAN' on the EWYL line.
It serves as a link between every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers.
21/2/24, 1:50 PM - Ananya Edoofa: It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that most of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, "I am a proud Edoofian.
21/2/24, 1:54 PM - +263 78 786 4935: *l am a proud Edoofian* 😁
21/2/24, 1:56 PM - +263 78 786 4935: Noted
21/2/24, 2:07 PM - Ananya Edoofa: As we plan for our sessions, you have the flexibility to choose between the following options:

Option 1: Monday and Thursday
Option 2: Tuesday and Friday
Feel free to select the days that best suit your schedule. Following your decision, I will provide you with an updated timetable.

Additionally, every Wednesday, I will share a piece of Wednesday wisdom, and we can discuss it in our subsequent session. Similarly, every Saturday, you will receive your weekend activity, and we will review it in our next session. Both of these components are essential for your evaluation and progress, so ensure their completion.

It's crucial to note that you will only receive your lessons and activities if you follow your EWYL (Every Week, Your Life) ritual consistently. Make it a daily practice, especially in the morning, to ensure timely sharing of activities and lessons.
21/2/24, 2:10 PM - +263 78 786 4935: Oky,,  think option 2 will work for you
21/2/24, 2:10 PM - +263 78 786 4935: Meant work for me
21/2/24, 2:16 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Alright!
