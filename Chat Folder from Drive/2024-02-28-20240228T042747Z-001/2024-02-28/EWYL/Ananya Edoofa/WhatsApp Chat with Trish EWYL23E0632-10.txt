7/1/24, 8:45 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good evening!

I wanted to share some exciting news with all of you. As you may have noticed, my schedule has been quite packed lately due to work commitments. The reason behind this is something truly special – our team has organized a three-day long industrial visit called SLICE CON' 24 for our Indian Edoofians! 🚀

During this event, we are fortunate to have the Co-founders and CEOs of prominent brands who will be present and sharing their invaluable experiences in one-on-one sessions. Yes, you read that right – they will be there live, right in front of us! What's even more thrilling is that a few of our students are presenting a presentation directly to these CEOs, showcasing why Africa, your homeland, is the best market for their products. 🤝
7/1/24, 8:45 PM - Ananya Edoofa: While I am filled with excitement for this event, please note that due to my involvement in the visit on the 8th, 9th, and 10th of January, our regular sessions won't be taking place on these days. When we connect on the 11th of January, I'll share my students' experiences and pictures with you. 📸✨
8/1/24, 9:37 AM - +263 77 821 6835: Ok thank you

21/2/24, 2:25 AM - +263 77 727 1107: As a proud Edoofian, i extend my sincere gratitude for the opportunity to be part of the coordination team for the recent meet and greet event.Your support,guidance and trust in me as an Edoofian meant a lot to me and I'm also grateful for the chance to contribute to the success of the event.

As a proud Edoofian i was so motivated to continue making a positive impact and contributing to meaningful programs and events in the future. Especially when i watch some videos at the event i feel that no one can stop my progress when I'm with Edoofa a family of success.

Moreover at this event i also gained a lot of experiences such as self confidence, problem solving and i look forward to the possibility of working with you all again in similiar initiatives that brings people together and create memorable experiences and shared successes.

However as a proud Edoofian i had noticed a lot of problems during the meet and greet event.Firstly the place was too small some people even remain outside the building which I'm not proud of as an Edoofian.I suggest that next time we will solve this problem by looking for a venue with big space so that people will feel at home.

Secondly, language barrier between our Admission Officers with the parents.Some African pa rents are not educated so when our team speak English only it will make them feel out of place.So i suggest that next time when this event will be also held, as Edoofian team we have to look for converters.This person must be a Zimbabwean who is well educated, he will be converting English to Shona language to makesure all  the information is heard by everyone.

Lastly food and issue of Tshirts to the coordinators.Some of the coordinators did not eat free food only because they were not wearing Edoofians Tshirts which is bad since all of them spent the rest of their day's  busy calling other students, accompanying the guest and so on.On this one i suggests we as Edoofa team we have to know the exactly  number of our coodinators and assist them with the material and resources they want to use at the event.
  
Thank you for giving me this chance to share my experiences  and make suggestions for improvements in the future event.

Yours grateful 💗
Proud Edoofian💗

26/2/24, 11:42 AM - Ananya Edoofa: No, Trish, I need to bring something important to your attention. There's been a concerning incident involving someone falsely claiming affiliation with our organization. This individual allegedly attended our event, took a photo, and then misled students by redirecting them to a random location. I want to clarify that this person is not associated with us in any way. Please help spread awareness to prevent others from being deceived.
26/2/24, 11:45 AM - +263 77 727 1107: Ok can we know who is that person,, so that we can be able to tell students to stay away from them
26/2/24, 11:48 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Well, I am not sure but remember we do not have any office there in Zimbabwe, so never ever visit any such place.
26/2/24, 11:49 AM - +263 77 727 1107: Ok ok i get you mam.Thank you for sharing this important news
26/2/24, 11:52 AM - +263 77 727 1107: Mam there's  that student who i have been talking with, he said he apply for a Scholarship in 2021 and he paid half of enrollment fee then after that his parents were not in a financial position to finish it and your team extended day for them but still they couldn't make it ,, so his question is that what he is supposed to do now since he had been paid half of enrollment fee?
26/2/24, 1:07 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Let me consult my team Trish.
26/2/24, 1:52 PM - +263 77 727 1107: Ok
