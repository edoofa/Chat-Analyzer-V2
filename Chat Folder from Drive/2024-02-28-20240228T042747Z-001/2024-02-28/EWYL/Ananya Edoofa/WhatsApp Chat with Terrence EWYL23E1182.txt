14/2/24, 8:41 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Terrence!

How are you doing? Are you ready for the session?🚀
14/2/24, 8:43 AM - +263 78 357 6095: Good morning Ms.Ananya am doing great.......yes am ready
14/2/24, 8:50 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
14/2/24, 8:51 AM - +263 78 357 6095: May you please tell me Mam
14/2/24, 8:52 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
14/2/24, 8:52 AM - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
14/2/24, 8:53 AM - +263 78 357 6095: Thank you Mam......I now have a better understanding
14/2/24, 8:55 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms. Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
14/2/24, 8:58 AM - +263 78 357 6095: Good morning Ms.Sanjana and Ms.Davi , its a pleasure to meet you
14/2/24, 8:58 AM - +263 78 357 6095: Thank you Mam for.the introduction
14/2/24, 8:59 AM - Ananya Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure that will happen after we discuss all our projects in depth (not now), which will mandate us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
14/2/24, 9:00 AM - +263 78 357 6095: Yes ,it sounds absolutely interesting
14/2/24, 9:11 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
14/2/24, 9:11 AM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
14/2/24, 9:24 AM - +263 78 357 6095: Thank you Mam....and i have read the newsletter
14/2/24, 10:03 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for not being able to move ahead with our session; something urgent came up that required my immediate attention. Now that our session time is over, let us connect tomorrow at the same time.
14/2/24, 10:04 AM - +263 78 357 6095: No problem Ms.Ananya have a great day
22/2/24, 7:39 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Terrence!

Now that we've successfully wrapped up our three-day event, it's time to resume our regular sessions. Our next session will be today at 8:30 AM. Make sure you're ready to jump back into our learning journey!

Also, don't forget to review what we covered last.🌟
22/2/24, 8:31 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Let us begin our session with an interesting fact: _Africa is home to the world's largest land mammal - the African elephant. These majestic creatures can weigh up to 6 metric tons (approximately 13,000 pounds) and are known for their intelligence, complex social structures, and remarkable memory. Isn't that incredible?_
22/2/24, 3:09 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I want to give you an update that our team is taking off tomorrow and won't have any sessions over the weekend. Let's reconvene and continue our discussions on Monday. Have a nice weekend!
26/2/24, 8:35 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Terrence!

How are you doing? How was your weekend?🚀
26/2/24, 9:43 AM - Ananya Edoofa: You know, I have an amazing session planned for you along with some targets for this month. However, I am quite disappointed that you did not attend your session. Can I know the reason behind this?
27/2/24, 10:55 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, @263783576095 

I hope this message finds you well. I've noticed that you have not been attending the sessions lately. Students need to participate in the orientation to ensure a smooth transition.

If you're facing any challenges, please feel free to share them with me. As your mentor, I'm here to assist you and help find solutions. Your success is important to me, and I'm committed to supporting you along the way. <This message was edited>
