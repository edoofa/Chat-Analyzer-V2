2/1/24, 9:05 AM - Ananya Edoofa: _So, This is what the First message should look like:_

Greetings Mr./Mrs *School Head Name*!

I wanted to share some exciting news with all of you. As you may have noticed, my schedule has been quite packed lately due to work commitments. The reason behind this is something truly special – our team has organized a three-day long industrial visit called *SLICE CON' 24* for our Indian Edoofians! 🚀

During this event, *we are fortunate to have the Co-founders and CEOs of prominent brands* who will be present and sharing their invaluable *experiences in one-on-one sessions.* Yes, you read that right – they will be there live, right in front of us! What's even more thrilling is that a few of our students are presenting a presentation directly to these CEOs, showcasing why Africa, your homeland, is the best market for their products. 🤝
6/1/24, 1:29 PM - Ananya Edoofa: While I am filled with excitement for this event, please note that due to my involvement in the visit on the *8th, 9th, and 10th of January*, our regular sessions won't be taking place on these days. When we connect on the 11th of January, I'll share my students' experiences and pictures with you. 📸✨

11/1/24, 11:09 AM - Ananya Edoofa: A lovely morning to you, Takundanashe!

Kindly excuse me for the short delay. I wanted to share a few glimpses of the industrial visit, SLICE CON 24, that was going on for the last three days, especially for our Indian Edoofinas! You know, it was so happening, and I am happy to share that we also welcomed Mr. Peter Hobwani, Deputy Head of Mission and Head of Chancery, Embassy of the Republic of Zimbabwe to India.

Not only this, but we also welcomed various industrial leaders, and it went super well; our students managed to give a presentation in front of them, and they really liked it. Our students also enjoyed the 'Tech made easy' sessions, where we taught them to use new-age technological tools, including Artificial Intelligence. The sweetest part was that a few of our students even prepared a surprise performance for us as well. It was indeed an amazing experience. When you are here in India, we will also connect at such events.

16/1/24, 9:19 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Alright! Now, Let me help you with the kind of communication that you should do with the school heads, okay?

2.I am immensely grateful for the invaluable guidance provided by my counselor, Sir Sahil, throughout the enrollment process at Edoofa. His expertise illuminated crucial aspects, such as understanding the percentage of scholarship available, the mechanics of scholarship credits, and insightful advice on choosing from the diverse range of programs. Sir Sahil not only facilitated the enrollment procedure but also served as a knowledgeable guide, ensuring that I made informed decisions about the programs aligning with my goals. Thanks to his support, my journey with Edoofa has been not only smooth but also enriched with a deeper understanding of the opportunities available.
16/1/24, 9:24 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, now that your school is already connected with us,  I would like you to connect with other School Heads.

Even before that, you can ask your schoolmates or peers, or neighbors if they have their School Head’s Contact.
16/1/24, 9:29 AM - +263 71 364 4123: I don't have them now but I'll definitely look for them today

I stand obliged to get an opportunity to connect with you, I hope to have a result/conclusion-driven conversation with you today.

May I know at what time you will be available to connect via Whatsapp?
18/1/24, 8:51 AM - +263 71 364 4123: Okay thank you for the help
18/1/24, 8:51 AM - Ananya Edoofa: For students, 


 I'm [Your Name], grateful for the Edoofa Scholarship taking me to study in India. With high tuition fees in Zimbabwe, this opportunity is a dream come true.
Back in Zimbabwe, internet costs were steep—around $500 annually. In India, it's just $40 a year, showing how much they value education.
In Zimbabwe, limited seats and job struggles after graduation were concerns. Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program eased these worries, offering $50 to $100 monthly.
Following the 5S principles helped me secure this scholarship. I encourage you to do the same. Counselors will ask questions based on the flyer attached.
Best of luck! Your dreams are closer than you think

23/1/24, 9:12 AM - Ananya Edoofa: *_🌟 URGENT UPDATE 🌟_*

Takundanashe, guess what? I'm super excited to share some awesome news – next month, we're planning a trip to Africa! 🌍 Yep, you heard it right! Our team is coming to your town. Just like last year, our students will be helping us organize the event, and we're looking for volunteers to join in and help manage everything! 🙌

Trust me, it will be an amazing experience with lots to learn! 🌈 Since planning this big event takes time and effort, our team will be so tight. 

In light of this, I'm proposing a slight adjustment to our session timetable. *Today, we won't be having our session as initially planned. However, worry not! I will soon share an updated timetable* and I am confident that together, we will create something truly extraordinary.

25/1/24, 1:25 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Takundanashe!

I have some exciting news to share with you. Tomorrow, we are going to celebrate Republic Day! Now, let me tell you a bit about it.

Republic Day is a special day in India. It's a time when we remember and celebrate the day our country adopted its Constitution. Just like a constitution helps guide a country, ours outlines the rules and principles that make India the diverse and vibrant place it is.

On Republic Day, we have a big parade in the capital city, where people from all over the country come together to showcase our culture, traditions, and achievements. It's like a colorful and lively show with music, dance, and different displays. The Indian flag is hoisted, and everyone sings the national anthem with pride.

People also fly kites, dress up in traditional clothes, and enjoy delicious food! 🇮🇳✨
25/1/24, 2:33 PM - +263 71 364 4123: Wow I'm looking forward to seeing pictures
