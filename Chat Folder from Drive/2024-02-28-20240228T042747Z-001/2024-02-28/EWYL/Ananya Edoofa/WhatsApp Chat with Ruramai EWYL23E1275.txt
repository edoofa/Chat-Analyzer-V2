22/2/24, 8:31 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Let us begin our session with an interesting fact: _Africa is home to the world's largest land mammal - the African elephant. These majestic creatures can weigh up to 6 metric tons (approximately 13,000 pounds) and are known for their intelligence, complex social structures, and remarkable memory. Isn't that incredible?_
22/2/24, 8:34 AM - +263 78 971 6608: Yes
22/2/24, 8:35 AM - Ananya Edoofa: So, to kick things off with a bang, I wanted to share a fantastic video with you that I think will help us connect on a deeper level. Get ready to be inspired!
22/2/24, 8:35 AM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
22/2/24, 8:42 AM - +263 78 971 6608: Ooh wow this is really inspiring and thank you for the assurance I also I'm willing to work with you and together we'll achieve higher
22/2/24, 8:43 AM - Ananya Edoofa: That's the spirit, Ruramai!🚀
22/2/24, 8:43 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Now, before we proceed further, I'd love to get to know you better! Would you be willing to share a bit about yourself? Your hobbies, goals, and passions?
22/2/24, 8:51 AM - +263 78 971 6608: My name is Ruramai Chowe. I am a young lady aged 18. I am a hardworking and driven individual who is not afraid to face any challenge. I'm passionate about my education and I would describe myself as an open and honest person who does not believe in misleading other people and who also tries to be fair in everything I do .My favorite hobby is netball, I'm a best player of netball on the position of goal shooter. My main goal is to become a well qualified and professional Lawyer. Lastly, I have interest in researching and performing various skills especially on the ground of education.
22/2/24, 8:55 AM - Ananya Edoofa: It's wonderful to meet someone as ambitious and dedicated as you. Your commitment to your education and your passion for netball truly shines through your words. The fact that you prioritize honesty and fairness speaks volumes about your character.
22/2/24, 8:57 AM - +263 78 971 6608: It's nice to meet you too.
22/2/24, 8:58 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Well, I can see that some other people have joined the group besides you. May I learn a little about each of them? I would appreciate it if we could engage in a quick conversation and get to know each other a bit.
22/2/24, 9:01 AM - +263 78 971 6608: My dad have also joined this group but I'm sure he is at work right now, he would have introduced himself to you .
22/2/24, 9:04 AM - Ananya Edoofa: That's alright! Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
22/2/24, 9:05 AM - +263 78 971 6608: No I don't.
22/2/24, 9:08 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
22/2/24, 9:08 AM - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
22/2/24, 9:10 AM - +263 78 971 6608: Noted thank you!
22/2/24, 9:11 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the EWYL team. 
Ms. Sanjana is the Head of the Department and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have Ms. Davi, Head coach is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
22/2/24, 9:14 AM - +263 78 971 6608: It's nice to meet them .
22/2/24, 9:14 AM - Ananya Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure that will happen after we discuss all our projects in depth (not now), which will mandate us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
22/2/24, 9:16 AM - +263 78 971 6608: Yes.
22/2/24, 9:19 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
22/2/24, 9:19 AM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>

22/2/24, 9:46 AM - +263 78 971 6608: You too!
22/2/24, 3:09 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I want to give you an update that our team is taking off tomorrow and won't have any sessions over the weekend. Let's reconvene and continue our discussions on Monday. Have a nice weekend!
22/2/24, 5:31 PM - +263 78 971 6608: You too!
26/2/24, 8:34 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Ruramai!

How are you doing? How was your weekend?🚀
26/2/24, 8:41 AM - +263 78 971 6608: Good morning
My weekend was okay what about yours?
26/2/24, 8:42 AM - Ananya Edoofa: My weekend was amazing, finally after days of hard work, I got some rest and spent some quality time with my family.😅
26/2/24, 8:44 AM - +263 78 971 6608: Amazing, it is good
26/2/24, 8:48 AM - Ananya Edoofa: We’re ready to begin your EWYL program now, and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects you can and will be a part of. Once you’ve gone through it thoroughly- we can discuss your understanding and then help you get started with the projects! Is that clear?
26/2/24, 8:49 AM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
26/2/24, 8:50 AM - +263 78 971 6608: Yes
26/2/24, 8:52 AM - Ananya Edoofa: I want you to share your understanding of the document with me. I just want to ensure we don’t miss anything! So, please, go on sharing your understanding of the above document.
26/2/24, 9:24 AM - +263 78 971 6608: From the above document I think it guides the students about how to earn a scholarship credit through the projects that are inside.It also teaches us how we can motivate other youth to be part of Edoofa and also it encourages us to have a never give up attitude. Lastly the other project teaches us about business and how we can have a bright future.
26/2/24, 9:26 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Good work, Ruramai!🌟
26/2/24, 9:26 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Now,  I will start by explaining the projects in detail. I am sharing an audio file with you. Here’s my suggestion- listen to it at least twice, you know- to make sure we don’t miss anything out, and then get back to me when you are finished with the process!
26/2/24, 9:26 AM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
26/2/24, 9:32 AM - +263 78 971 6608: It is clear now we can move forward.
26/2/24, 9:38 AM - Ananya Edoofa: This message was deleted
26/2/24, 9:38 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Great! Now that our session time is over, let us connect tomorrow at the same time. Meanwhile, I want you to read the document and share your understanding with me before our next session so that we can make the most out of it.
26/2/24, 9:38 AM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
26/2/24, 9:53 AM - +263 78 971 6608: The above document is actually a guidance on how I can look for a right company to work with.
27/2/24, 10:54 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Ruramai 

Kindly excuse me for not being able to connect today for our session. Our whole team was involved in an important meeting with Mr. Angad, where we discussed crucial strategies to enhance your skills and readiness for employment. I hope that together, we will work hard and fulfill our dreams.

Now that we cannot have our session as planned, let us connect tomorrow at 8:30 am. Have a good day ahead!
27/2/24, 3:08 PM - Ananya Edoofa: During my discussion with Mr. Angad today, I realized the need for more efficient and effective sessions with my students to expedite our progress.

In light of this, I have decided to *reschedule our sessions to Monday through Friday from 1:30 PM to 3:00 PM*. This schedule change will ensure more productive sessions, and I look forward to seeing you tomorrow at the new time!
