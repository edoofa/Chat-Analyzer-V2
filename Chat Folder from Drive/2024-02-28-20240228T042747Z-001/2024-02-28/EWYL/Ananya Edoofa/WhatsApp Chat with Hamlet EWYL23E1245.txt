How was your weekend? Are you ready for your session?🚀
12/2/24, 1:41 PM - +263 77 114 2891: Good afternoon my weekend was good.
12/2/24, 1:41 PM - +263 77 114 2891: Yes we can start
12/2/24, 1:49 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Moving ahead, I'd like to tell you about the *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
12/2/24, 1:52 PM - +263 77 114 2891: Its ok
12/2/24, 1:52 PM - +263 77 114 2891: Can you explain so that i understand
12/2/24, 1:55 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
12/2/24, 1:55 PM - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
12/2/24, 1:59 PM - +263 77 114 2891: Well explained thank you
12/2/24, 2:01 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms. Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
12/2/24, 2:02 PM - +263 77 114 2891: Ok thank
12/2/24, 2:02 PM - +263 77 114 2891: Thank you
12/2/24, 2:08 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure that will happen after we discuss all our projects in depth (not now), which will mandate us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
12/2/24, 2:13 PM - +263 77 114 2891: Yes intreresting lets hope its easy not difficult its my first time to join such a programme and iam doing it on behalf of Hamlet(my son).You must be patient enough kkk.

13/2/24, 1:49 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Hamlet!

I have observed that you have not been texting me at your session timings; it has always been me who drops a reminder message at your session time. Has your teacher ever dropped a reminder message to you before the class?
13/2/24, 2:01 PM - +263 77 114 2891: Good afternoon iam sorry  ma'am
13/2/24, 2:06 PM - +263 77 114 2891: Iam Hamlet's mother .Hamlet is at school as i said

14/2/24, 1:44 PM - +263 77 114 2891: Yes iam ready
14/2/24, 1:59 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
14/2/24, 1:59 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
14/2/24, 2:01 PM - +263 77 114 2891: Its fine let me go through
14/2/24, 2:17 PM - +263 77 114 2891: Iam done
14/2/24, 2:19 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Did you notice the _Edoofa Hall of Inspiration_? I am sure you would one day want yourself to be celebrated in this section, the entire Student community reads this newsletter and it's a great deal to be mentioned by the founder himself, isn't it?
14/2/24, 2:22 PM - +263 77 114 2891: Yes true its so inspiring thanx for sharing
14/2/24, 2:25 PM - Ananya Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound?
14/2/24, 2:26 PM - +263 77 114 2891: Great
14/2/24, 2:26 PM - +263 77 114 2891: It sounds good
14/2/24, 2:28 PM - Ananya Edoofa: We’re ready to begin your EWYL program now, and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects you can and will be a part of. Once you’ve gone through it thoroughly- we can discuss your understanding and then help you get started with the projects! Is that clear?
14/2/24, 2:29 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
14/2/24, 2:30 PM - +263 77 114 2891: Yes its clear

14/2/24, 6:24 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Hi,*Hamlet Junior Makanakaishe Chiradza*.!

You'll gain practical knowledge through seminars and sessions by industry experts, and be inspired by real-life experiences from your seniors who are already thriving in India thanks to Edoofa.

14/2/24, 6:28 PM - +263 77 114 2891: Noted. I am afraid we will not make it this time. The notice period is short and we are yet to clear our enrolment balance $150. We stay in the extreme west of the country which is far from the Capital City. Moreover,  Hamlet is at School near the Western border town of Plum Tree. All these factors make it difficult for us to attend this time, but it is otherwise a wonderful opportunity to meet with the organising team early on.
15/2/24, 6:42 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, @263771142891 

I completely understand your concerns about the travel, and I appreciate your consideration. However, I want to emphasise that this event is not just a gathering; it's an investment in your future education.

26/2/24, 2:35 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I wish we could have connected for more time, however, since our session time is over, let us connect tomorrow at the same time.🚀

Before we dive into today's session, here's a fun fact about parrots: Did you know that parrots are one of the few animal species that can mimic human speech? Some parrots, like the African grey parrot, have been known to learn hundreds of words and even use them in context! Isn't that amazing?🦜
27/2/24, 1:37 PM - +263 77 114 2891: Yes really amazing
27/2/24, 1:39 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, in order to move ahead with your second project, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
27/2/24, 1:39 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I am ____________, a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in *Zimbabwe*, where tuition fees range from ZWL 650,000 to ZWL 750,000 per term. When considering the yearly cost, including food and accommodation, it exceeds $2,100 in our beloved Zimbabwe⏫

Today, the internet is a necessity, and I truly realized its importance when preparing for my journey to India. We are all well aware of the expenses we have to bear just to access subpar internet services. During my school days, I used to spend a minimum of $35-$40 a month to ensure I had sufficient internet, which added up to around $450-$500 annually.
*It's remarkable to discover that in India, students value their educational infrastructure so much that they can access a necessity like the internet for around $40 for the entire year.*💥
Conversely, when speaking to my seniors in Zimbabwe, I realized that I might have to compromise on my choice of course due to limited available seats. Furthermore, many seniors are struggling with unemployment after graduating in Zimbabwe
I had a strong desire to support my family through part-time employment during my course, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn between $50 and $100 per month throughout the course.
*While pursuing tertiary education in India is more affordable than universities in Zimbabwe, it comes with its own challenges. I diligently followed the 5S, which played a crucial role in helping me qualify for this scholarship. I urge you to go through these Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors will ask you questions based on the information in the flyer I have attached*
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5s of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!
