12/2/24, 1:53 PM - +263 78 199 1982: Thank you, l have watched the video
12/2/24, 1:56 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Before we proceed further, I'd love to get to know you better! Would you be willing to share a bit about yourself? Your hobbies, goals, and passions?
12/2/24, 2:03 PM - +263 78 199 1982: Ok, my name is Violet .l am a girl aged 17. I am an A level student. I like to play netball. My aspiration is to be a successful young lady or l would rather say a successful lawyer .During my free time lm usually engrossed in novels
12/2/24, 2:09 PM - Ananya Edoofa: That's wonderful, Violet! Being an A-level student and aspiring to become a successful lawyer shows great ambition and determination. Your love for playing netball demonstrates your commitment to staying active and maintaining a healthy lifestyle. Immersing yourself in novels during your free time is a fantastic way to expand your knowledge, vocabulary, and imagination. Keep pursuing your goals with passion and dedication, and you'll surely achieve success in your endeavors!
12/2/24, 2:10 PM - +263 78 199 1982: Thank you😊
12/2/24, 2:13 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
12/2/24, 2:16 PM - +263 78 199 1982: No
12/2/24, 2:18 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure that will happen after we discuss all our projects in depth (not now), which will mandate us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
12/2/24, 2:22 PM - +263 78 199 1982: Yes cant wait for the "Wednesday Wisdom"
12/2/24, 2:24 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.

13/2/24, 1:49 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Violet

I have observed that you have not been texting me at your session timings; it has always been me who drops a reminder message at your session time. Has your teacher ever dropped a reminder message to you before the class?
13/2/24, 2:04 PM - +263 78 199 1982: At school we always remind the teacher
13/2/24, 2:36 PM - Ananya Edoofa: That's alright, however now that our session time is over, let us connect tomorrow at the same time. Have a good day ahead!🚀

These majestic creatures can weigh up to 6 metric tons (approximately 13,000 pounds) and are known for their intelligence, complex social structures, and remarkable memory. Isn't that incredible?_
21/2/24, 1:35 PM - +263 78 199 1982: It is indeed
21/2/24, 1:44 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Well, can you please explain a bit more?
21/2/24, 1:47 PM - +263 78 199 1982: The African elephant is truly an amazing creature. Elephants are known for their intelligence, and they have been shown to be capable of learning new tasks and solving problems. They also have complex social structures, living in groups called herds that can be as large as 100 individuals. The matriarch, or oldest female, is typically the leader of the herd. Elephants also have incredible memories, and are able to remember other elephants, places, and even specific events that happened years earlier.
21/2/24, 1:48 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Violet, I was asking about this!
21/2/24, 1:51 PM - +263 78 199 1982: There is nothing much ...we are doing paper work for the upcoming November examinations

21/2/24, 2:15 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Yes, Now We’re ready to begin your EWYL program now, and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects you can and will be a part of. Once you’ve gone through it thoroughly- we can discuss your understanding and then help you get started with the projects! Is that clear?
21/2/24, 2:15 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
21/2/24, 2:17 PM - +263 78 199 1982: Ok

26/2/24, 1:16 PM - +263 78 199 1982: Hi
26/2/24, 1:28 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Violet!

How are you doing? How was your weekend?🚀
26/2/24, 1:29 PM - +263 78 199 1982: Afternoon, my weekend was super good
26/2/24, 1:35 PM - Ananya Edoofa: My weekend was amazing, finally after days of hard work, I got some rest and spent some quality time with my family.😅
26/2/24, 1:37 PM - +263 78 199 1982: Thats good
26/2/24, 1:46 PM - Ananya Edoofa: So, did you get a chance to read the document?
26/2/24, 1:49 PM - +263 78 199 1982: Yes l did
26/2/24, 1:50 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I want you to share your understanding of the document with me. I just want to ensure we don’t miss anything! So, please, go on sharing your understanding of the above document.
26/2/24, 1:51 PM - +263 78 199 1982: In the first project I've understood that i will have to look for a finance technology company that has about 25-30 employees. I will have to find or recognize the decision makers of the company through LinkedIn. I will therefore send them a message to them. After they have responded i will have to share Edoofa's message to them through my connections. Once the organization agrees to sign a contract I will have to make a group call. Then a Google sheet will be created to record the progress of the project
The second project requires me to find youths in my community who are interested in this program and make them sign an application form. The youth must have recently graduated or six months back. Then with the help of Edoofa we will work together to reach out to my network. Then for every student that enroll in the Edoofa and pay the enter fee I will get $20 and for a student that gets admitted and finish the whole procedures I will get $30.
The last project need me to make a list of high schools in my community and my school will have to be on the top. Edoofa will recognize these people  through LinkedIn and you will reach out to them with well written emails. The team Edoofa will help me connect with the decision makers of the schools and close the contract.
26/2/24, 1:54 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Great!🚀
26/2/24, 1:54 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I will start by explaining the projects in detail. I am sharing an audio file with you. Here’s my suggestion- listen to it at least twice, you know- to make sure we don’t miss anything out, and then get back to me when you are finished with the process!
26/2/24, 1:54 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
26/2/24, 1:56 PM - +263 78 199 1982: Ok
26/2/24, 1:59 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Okay, so very quickly you summarize whatever you learned in the audio for me? Just so we’re on the same page about it.
26/2/24, 2:18 PM - +263 78 199 1982: I will have to identify a company that deals with finances and l will have to start off by looking at a company maybe of one of my relatives and share my objectives and explain how Edoofa is helping me with electing necessary skills for future use after graduation etc..
26/2/24, 2:21 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Amazing, thanks Violet. I’m happy with your understanding.
26/2/24, 2:21 PM - Ananya Edoofa: So, I am going to share an extremely significant document with you. Read it thoroughly as well as with careful details. I assure you- it’s as important as it sounds. After reading it, I want you to share what you understood from it. It helps me get a sense of how you’re learning with me!

27/2/24, 1:36 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Violet!

Before we dive into today's session, here's a fun fact about parrots: Did you know that parrots are one of the few animal species that can mimic human speech? Some parrots, like the African grey parrot, have been known to learn hundreds of words and even use them in context! Isn't that amazing?🦜
27/2/24, 1:40 PM - +263 78 199 1982: Afternoon.... Yes thus amazing
27/2/24, 1:44 PM - Ananya Edoofa: So, did you get a chance to read the doument?
27/2/24, 1:47 PM - +263 78 199 1982: Yes but it confused me a bit l think l need a brief summary of it
27/2/24, 1:49 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, let me share the pointers :

1. _Avoid reaching out to large-scale companies._
2. The company can be _African or Indian_. If the company is Indian then it should have some operation or association in African nations.
3. The _target audience_ of the company should focus on youth. Domains- Ed-Tech, E-Commerce, Gaming, Skincare, Haircare, Cosmetics, Media/PR, Food and Beverages, etc.
4. The company should _not_ belong to these particular sectors:
- Manufacturing
- Finance
- Real Estate/Construction
- Energy Solutions
- Cloud services/Business solutions, etc.​
27/2/24, 1:52 PM - +263 78 199 1982: Ok l now understand
27/2/24, 1:53 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Okay- now here are 2 things I would like to briefly summarize –
1 –  You can use the following form to share the company details with me
*Company Details for Project 1*

Name of the company:
Website:
Name of the Contact Person:
Designation:
Linkedin ID/Whatsapp Phone Number:
Description of the company:
How did you get in touch with the contact person?
27/2/24, 1:53 PM - Ananya Edoofa: 2, and the fun part- I’m sure you read about Scholarship Credits in the document- so, here’s the opportunity for you to earn Scholarship Credits through Project 1 –

1. If you can set up a Company Call with Edoofa Managers : *$2 per call*
2. If the Company signs an MOU with Edoofa : *$20*
3. If the Company Gives internship/job opportunities to 
the students of Edoofa in the future(proposal): *$10*
27/2/24, 1:56 PM - +263 78 199 1982: Ok its understandeable
27/2/24, 1:57 PM - Ananya Edoofa: *Now that we’ve both summarized our understanding of the project, I think we’re ready to move to the next project!* This project is quite possibly a student favorite! So, now I am going to share another audio file and we’ll follow the same process- you ensure you don’t miss anything in it and use this time to play this audio more than once, let’s get to it!
27/2/24, 1:58 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
27/2/24, 2:04 PM - +263 78 199 1982: I understood it
27/2/24, 2:07 PM - Ananya Edoofa: This message was deleted
27/2/24, 2:08 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Okay, so very quickly you summarize whatever you learned in the audio for me? Just so we’re on the same page about it.
27/2/24, 2:14 PM - +263 78 199 1982: I will approach my close friends ,relatives or classmates who are willing to study abroad and who have already completed their high school .l will then tell them about my Journey with Edoofa and share with them the benefits of it. I will explain the EWYL program to them l will also tell them expenses enrolled with the program l should only consider people who are very serious about studying abroad only to apply since Edoofa has many students over 50000 who apply everyday
27/2/24, 2:15 PM - Ananya Edoofa: That’s awesome ,I’m confident that if you continue to pay attention to the information shared and then respond accordingly, we will make a great team. Now, here are 2 things I’d like  to briefly remind you of from the Community Building Project.

27/2/24, 2:23 PM - Ananya Edoofa: *Using WhatsApp Community Groups for Outreach:*
*Step 1*: Create a WhatsApp group and name it using the format STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DDMMYYYY. For example, if you're the mentor, it would be *MENTOR NAME/DDMMYYYY*.

*Step 2*: Find the right students for your group to ensure effective communication about Edoofa.

*Purpose*: The goal is to reach a broad audience, providing accurate information about Edoofa to prepare them for a smooth counseling session.
27/2/24, 2:23 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Execution:

*Identify Potential Candidates:* - Reach out to students in Form 6 or those who have recently passed Form 6 (A-Level Examination).

*Connect with Form 6 Divisions*: - Assume there are 3 divisions in Form 6, each with around 20 students. Begin with one division. Connect with these students and request to be added to their official or unofficial WhatsApp group.

*Share Your Group Link*: - Once added, share the link to your created WhatsApp group, explaining that it's an opportunity to pursue education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on tuition fees. Encourage them to join for more details.

*Repeat the Process*: - Move on to the next divisions of Form 6, applying the same approach. In this way, you'll reach at least 60 students (3 divisions of Form 6).

*Extend to Form 5*: - Repeat the process in Form 5, targeting another 60 students.
27/2/24, 2:23 PM - Ananya Edoofa: *Result*:

You would have effectively shared information about Edoofa with a minimum of 120 students, creating awareness and interest among potential applicants. This method ensures a wide reach and prepares students for the upcoming counseling sessions.
