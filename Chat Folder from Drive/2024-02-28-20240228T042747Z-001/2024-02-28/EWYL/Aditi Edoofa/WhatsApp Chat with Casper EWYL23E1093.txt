6/2/24, 1:40 PM - +263 71 132 2777: Ok let me forward to them
6/2/24, 1:41 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Sure!
6/2/24, 1:41 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I would like to begin this journey by knowing you beyond the _Statement of Purpose._ Can you share with me what are your long-term goals and how do you think this EWYL Program will help you in achieving them?
6/2/24, 1:44 PM - +263 71 132 2777: My long term goals are to finish my alevel studies with pleasing results. Complete my bachelor's degree and then venture into the real world where I can get to share my knowledge and experience with the world

Completing your A-level studies with pleasing results is a fantastic ambition and sets a strong foundation for your academic journey. Pursuing a bachelor's degree will further expand your knowledge and skills, preparing you for success in the real world. It's inspiring to hear that you aim to share your knowledge and experiences with others, contributing positively to the world around you. Keep striving for excellence in your studies, and I'm confident that you'll achieve your goals and make a meaningful impact in your chosen field!
6/2/24, 1:51 PM - +263 71 132 2777: And the EWYL can help me achieve this because with the EWYL i can gain exposure to the real world and also get to interact with different people and how the operate in their day to day activities
6/2/24, 1:52 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Indeed! It will help you achieve exposure!
6/2/24, 1:52 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
6/2/24, 1:53 PM - +263 71 132 2777: Thank you so much 
Its sounds so real coming from another person
6/2/24, 1:53 PM - +263 71 132 2777: No can you please explain them to me
6/2/24, 1:54 PM - Aditi Edoofa: You're welcome!
6/2/24, 1:54 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
6/2/24, 1:54 PM - Aditi Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
6/2/24, 1:57 PM - +263 71 132 2777: Ok now i really understand the objectives clearly
6/2/24, 1:57 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skillset through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
6/2/24, 2:00 PM - +263 71 132 2777: Ok nice to know oy Ms.Sanjana and Ms.Dave
I want to say i am excited to be interacting with you
6/2/24, 2:00 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Awesome!
6/2/24, 2:01 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
6/2/24, 2:02 PM - +263 71 132 2777: Right!
6/2/24, 2:03 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 10 minutes should be enough.
6/2/24, 2:03 PM - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
6/2/24, 2:03 PM - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
6/2/24, 2:08 PM - +263 71 132 2777: Yes they will be enough
6/2/24, 2:11 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
6/2/24, 2:23 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Did you notice the _Edoofa Hall of Inspiration_? I am sure you would one day want yourself to be celebrated in this section, the entire Student community reads this newsletter and it's a great deal to be mentioned by the founder himself, isn't it?
6/2/24, 2:31 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Concluding our session, I want to say it's been an amazing conversation.
Have a good day!
6/2/24, 2:31 PM - +263 71 132 2777: Wow he really is a man with great wisdom and integrity
I am so inspired and i also want to be read like this

7/2/24, 1:46 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I am well. Thanks for asking.
7/2/24, 1:47 PM - Aditi Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound?
7/2/24, 1:48 PM - +263 71 132 2777: That sounds wonderful!
7/2/24, 1:49 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I would like to ask you a few questions to understand how much from our discussion you could retain and if there is anything for us to discuss again.
7/2/24, 1:49 PM - Aditi Edoofa: So here are the questions, answer them in detail:

1. Share a small introduction of everyone on your  EWYL team.
2. What goals has your mentor set for your EWYL journey?
3. How does Mr. Angad Singh, founder of Edoofa, interact with all students?
A. Newsletter       B. Youtube

4. Explain in your own words what the Hall of Inspiration is.
7/2/24, 1:54 PM - +263 71 132 2777: 1. We have Ms Sanjana who is the Head of the department and all group conversations, we also have Ms Dave who is the head coach  who will be mentoring us and then my mentor Ms Aditi
7/2/24, 1:58 PM - +263 71 132 2777: first goal is to ensure that all Edoofians have an equal opportunity to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that we are equipped for the employment market once we have acquired our final degrees and are ready to begin our professional careers. <This message was edited>

7/2/24, 2:06 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
7/2/24, 2:06 PM - Aditi Edoofa: We’re ready to begin your EWYL program now, and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects you can and will be a part of. Once you’ve gone through it thoroughly- we can discuss your understanding and then help you get started with the projects! Is it clear?
