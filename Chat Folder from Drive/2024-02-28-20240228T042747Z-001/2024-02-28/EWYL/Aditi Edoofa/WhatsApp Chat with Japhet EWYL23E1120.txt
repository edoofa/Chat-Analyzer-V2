12/2/24, 8:38 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
12/2/24, 8:38 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
12/2/24, 8:39 AM - +263 77 641 7859: No... what are these objectives
12/2/24, 8:42 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
12/2/24, 8:42 AM - Aditi Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
12/2/24, 8:43 AM - +263 77 641 7859: Understood
12/2/24, 8:47 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skillset through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
12/2/24, 8:55 AM - +263 77 641 7859: We are humbled to know them 
Thank you

20/2/24, 2:13 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Hello Japhet!

The past three days flew by in a whirlwind for Team Edoofa – both for those in India and those in Harare for the Meet and Greet '24. Now that we've had a chance to catch our breath, I want to extend my sincere gratitude to you for being a part of the event and contributing to its success.

Your insights from the event are highly valued, and I'm keen to hear about your experience. Would you be open to sharing your thoughts, including your interest in attending similar events in the future and any suggestions for improvement? Additionally, if you have captured any memorable moments in photos, we would greatly appreciate you sharing them.

Your perspective is crucial, and I also encourage you to discuss the event with your parents and gather their feedback.
22/2/24, 7:58 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Good Morning Japhet!
Hope you are well.

Team Edoofa experienced a whirlwind over the past three days, with activities bustling in both India and Harare for the Meet and Greet '24 event. After a brief moment to collect ourselves, we're ready to return to our original schedule and move forward in our journey. 
*Our session will commence today at 8:30 AM.*

22/2/24, 8:17 AM - +263 78 438 6909: I am fine
22/2/24, 8:17 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Also, may I have a response on this please.
22/2/24, 8:27 AM - Aditi Edoofa: So let's begin with today's session🚀
22/2/24, 8:31 AM - +263 77 641 7859: We didn't manage to attend the session we had a problem as a family 
Our apologies  but we just heard that people had a good time during the event
22/2/24, 8:33 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, I understand.
22/2/24, 8:33 AM - Aditi Edoofa: We will begin from here, I hope everything is clear till this point.
22/2/24, 8:49 AM - +263 77 641 7859: Yes
22/2/24, 8:53 AM - Aditi Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
22/2/24, 8:55 AM - +263 78 438 6909: Yess
22/2/24, 8:58 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 10 minutes should be enough. <This message was edited>

Thanks for asking!
26/2/24, 8:47 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Did you notice the _Edoofa Hall of Inspiration_? I am sure you would one day want yourself to be celebrated in this section, the entire Student community reads this newsletter and it's a great deal to be mentioned by the founder himself, isn't it?
26/2/24, 8:48 AM - +263 77 641 7859: That will be great
26/2/24, 8:52 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Indeed!
26/2/24, 8:52 AM - Aditi Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound?
26/2/24, 9:39 AM - Aditi Edoofa: We are concluding today's session. We will reconvene tomorrow for our session.🚀
