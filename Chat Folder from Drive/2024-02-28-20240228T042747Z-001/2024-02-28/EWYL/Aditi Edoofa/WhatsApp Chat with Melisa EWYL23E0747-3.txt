6/1/24, 1:25 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I wanted to share some exciting news with all of you. As you may have noticed, my schedule has been quite packed lately due to work commitments. The reason behind this is something truly special – our team has organized a three-day long industrial visit called *SLICE CON' 24* for our Indian Edoofians! 🚀

During this event, *we are fortunate to have the Co-founders and CEOs of prominent brands* who will be present and sharing their invaluable experiences in one-on-one sessions. Yes, you read that right – they will be there live, right in front of us! What's even more thrilling is that a few of *our students are presenting a presentation directly to these CEOs*, showcasing why Africa, your homeland, is the best market for their products. 🤝
6/1/24, 1:25 PM - Aditi Edoofa: While I am filled with excitement for this event, please note that due to my involvement in the visit on the *8th, 9th, and 10th of January*, our regular sessions won't be taking place on these days. When we connect on the 11th of January, I'll share my students' experiences and pictures with you. 📸✨
7/1/24, 3:16 AM - +263 78 050 5370: Wow I guess  it will be  fantastic
7/1/24, 3:16 AM - +263 78 050 5370: Ok ma'am thank you
11/1/24, 4:10 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Hellooooo!!!!

I quickly just wanted to share the scoop on *Slice Con'24—it was seriously awesome!* The event was nothing short of extraordinary, providing students with a wealth of exposure and valuable insights. 🚀
Throughout the event, students actively engaged with CEOs, asking insightful questions and gaining a deeper understanding of various industries. The *AI sessions* were particularly enlightening, offering a glimpse into the cutting-edge advancements in technology and some amazing AI Tools🤖

But wait, there's more! They also played games and made some great memories. It was a total win-win—fun and educational at the same time. Here is a glimpse of how it went, looking forward to when you will also get this chance to be here and experience these amazing things🤩❤️

While we were having multiple conversations with our students in the past few days for the meet & greet event, we figured that there is a slight confusion in the invitation dates. Hence, I wanted to quickly reach out and ensure that the same is not the case with you.

- As per the invitation, *you* are supposed to attend the event along with your parents on *19th of February* which is Monday.
 
- If you are recommending any of *your friends (Non Edoofians)* along with their parents to attend the event, as per their choice, the seminar is scheduled for *18th of February (8am/1pm) or 19th February(1pm)*. They should carry a physical copy of their admit cards to enter the event.
17/2/24, 9:01 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Please ensure that you are present at the venue 30 minutes earlier and are dressed appropriately.
Don't forget to carry your admit card!

20/2/24, 2:27 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Hello Melisa!

The past three days flew by in a whirlwind for Team Edoofa – both for those in India and those in Harare for the Meet and Greet '24. Now that we've had a chance to catch our breath, I want to extend my sincere gratitude to you for being a part of the event and contributing to its success.

Your insights from the event are highly valued, and I'm keen to hear about your experience. Would you be open to sharing your thoughts, including your interest in attending similar events in the future and any suggestions for improvement? Additionally, if you have captured any memorable moments in photos, we would greatly appreciate you sharing them.

Your perspective is crucial, and I also encourage you to discuss the event with your parents and gather their feedback.
20/2/24, 5:41 PM - +263 78 050 5370: Thank you ma'am 

I will share my experiences
20/2/24, 5:55 PM - +263 78 050 5370: So ma'am  when are we going to  have our results
21/2/24, 11:22 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Good Morning Melisa!
Hope you are well.

You will have your results shortly, also looking forward to knowing about your experience.
21/2/24, 11:59 AM - +263 78 050 5370: Thank you maam
21/2/24, 12:05 PM - +263 78 050 5370: Ok lemme me give you a brief summary  of my experiences  of the past weekend 

I went to the venue  on 18 February  2024. I wrote my exam just like others. 

We watched  some videos  of fellow  members of the  Edoofa  team  and I was very impressed. Their  experiences  on their journey  to India  were very inspiring  to an extent that I can't  wait to reach  there. I met different  people  from different  places and I learnt many  things f4om them. I was accompanied  by my parents and my little  brother. 

I missed some pictures  because I was instructed  to go and meet the admission officers  who were at N1 hotel for more information and clarity. So I could  not manage  to take some pictures  with my fellow  Edoofians.
21/2/24, 3:11 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your weekend experience. It sounds like it was both productive and inspiring. Writing the exam and watching the videos of other Edoofa members must have been enlightening, especially hearing about their journeys to India. It's great that you had the opportunity to meet people from different places and learn from their experiences. While you may have missed out on taking pictures with your fellow Edoofians due to attending the information session, the knowledge and clarity gained from that interaction are valuable.
21/2/24, 5:43 PM - +263 78 050 5370: Thanks  ma'am
22/2/24, 7:23 PM - +263 77 369 3241: How are you ma'am ? Here we are all fine. To be honest ma'am, last weekend was so good to us as a family . First of all l  am happy that I met the Edoofa team from India. I thank God for that.   I am happy that we heard some testimony  from other fellow students that how did they go through to be what they are and told us that thing is 💯 real. I was doubting  because of what other people say about it but now I have all the confidence in Edoofa. We had good time with your team having all the opportunity to ask all the questions that we have had in our minds. All were answered. We are satisfied. I was happy as well to meet the admission officers . It as well made me know that  my last  proof of payment  in January  I posted it to the wrong group instead of the admission group and they were corrected. I am happy. Unfortunately we couldn't manage to take photos because we were hurrying to meet the admission officers in town  since she was advised to change the program from sociology to law of which that was her wish from the beginning. In short i can say , ABOVE ALL , IT WAS A GREAT DAY. GOOD TIME.
22/2/24, 7:23 PM - +263 77 369 3241: I am Melissa' s mother
24/2/24, 9:12 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Good Morning!
Hope you are well.

I'm delighted to hear that you and your family had such a positive experience last weekend! Meeting the Edoofa team from India and hearing testimonies from fellow students must have been truly inspiring and reassuring. It's understandable to have doubts initially, especially with conflicting information, but having the opportunity to interact directly with the team and get all your questions answered seems to have cleared any uncertainties. It's also great that you were able to connect with the admission officers and sort out any administrative matters.
26/2/24, 2:59 AM - +263 77 369 3241: We are all well. Thank you. How are you over there?
26/2/24, 7:41 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Good Morning!
I am well. Hope you are well too.
