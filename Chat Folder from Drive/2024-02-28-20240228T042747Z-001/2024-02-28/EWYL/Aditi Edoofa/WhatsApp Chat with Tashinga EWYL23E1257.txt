Hope you are well.

Team Edoofa experienced a whirlwind over the past three days, with activities bustling in both India and Harare for the Meet and Greet '24 event. After a brief moment to collect ourselves, we're ready to return to our original schedule and move forward in our journey. 
*Our session will commence today at 8:30 AM.* <This message was edited>
22/2/24, 8:02 AM - +263 78 013 3757: Ok noted
22/2/24, 8:28 AM - Aditi Edoofa: So let's begin with today's session🚀
22/2/24, 8:39 AM - +263 78 013 3757: Yes we can proceed
22/2/24, 8:41 AM - Aditi Edoofa: So Tashinga, I would like to begin this journey by knowing you beyond the Statement of Purpose. Can you share with me what are your long-term goals and how do you think this EWYL Program will help you in achieving them?
22/2/24, 8:50 AM - +263 78 013 3757: Ok,,,, my long term goals are acquiring a bachelor in Medical lab technology so that I will be well professionally equipped for my job since I wish to work with both local and international medical institutions thereby practicing my job effectively.

As for the EWYL program, Apart from reducing my tuition fee it will also anchor me in achieving my dreams through gaining some skills which I will use in the future .
22/2/24, 8:55 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Your commitment to acquiring a Bachelor's degree in Medical Lab Technology and working in both local and international medical settings shows dedication to your profession and a desire to impact healthcare positively. Participating in the EWYL program reduces tuition fees and equips you with valuable skills for your future career. Your proactive pursuit of skill enhancement is commendable. Keep utilizing programs like EWYL to support your academic and career goals. With determination, success as a proficient medical lab technologist is within reach. Best of luck on your journey!
22/2/24, 8:55 AM - +263 78 013 3757: Thank you
22/2/24, 9:00 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your EWYL team. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our two key objectives are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
22/2/24, 9:00 AM - +263 78 013 3757: Not yet
22/2/24, 9:03 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
22/2/24, 9:03 AM - Aditi Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
22/2/24, 9:06 AM - +263 78 013 3757: Well understood
22/2/24, 9:09 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skillset through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
22/2/24, 9:11 AM - +263 78 013 3757: Ok its nice knowing them
22/2/24, 9:15 AM - Aditi Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*

22/2/24, 9:17 AM - +263 78 013 3757: Yeah
22/2/24, 9:20 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 10 minutes should be enough.
