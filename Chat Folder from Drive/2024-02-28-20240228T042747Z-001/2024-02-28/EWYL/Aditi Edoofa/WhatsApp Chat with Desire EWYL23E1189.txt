30/1/24, 8:42 AM - +265 888 03 87 59: Oh we Can't do it without them today coz they are currently busy
Can we go on today and they will join tomorrow
30/1/24, 8:46 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, sure, I understand!
30/1/24, 8:46 AM - Aditi Edoofa: I would like to begin this journey by knowing you beyond the _Statement of Purpose._ Can you share with me what are your long-term goals and how do you think this EWYL Program will help you in achieving them?
30/1/24, 8:52 AM - +265 888 03 87 59: I want to become a very successful economist not only in my country but even outside where i want big companies or organisations to trust me and depend on me in different areas like decision making even more

So the EWYL program i strongly believe that it will help me to achieve them because those credits that i will be receiving will lessen the burden that my parents have to bear in paying school fees,atleast part of the remaing fees will be covered through this program making me go further with my education and dreams
30/1/24, 8:55 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your aspirations and goals with me. It's commendable that you have a clear vision of becoming a successful economist and contributing not only to your country but globally. The ambition to earn the trust of big companies and organizations showcases your determination.

I'm glad to hear that you see the EWYL program as a valuable opportunity to support your educational journey. The financial assistance provided through the program will indeed alleviate the burden on your parents and contribute to fulfilling your dreams.
30/1/24, 8:57 AM - +265 888 03 87 59: Thank you so much
30/1/24, 8:58 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
30/1/24, 9:00 AM - +265 888 03 87 59: No please you can remind me so we can be on the same pace
30/1/24, 9:01 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Sure,  let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
30/1/24, 9:01 AM - Aditi Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
30/1/24, 9:03 AM - +265 888 03 87 59: Yes yes,i understand now
30/1/24, 9:04 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skillset through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
30/1/24, 9:06 AM - +265 888 03 87 59: Oh okay okay,it will be nice to interact with both of them
30/1/24, 9:08 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Indeed!
30/1/24, 9:08 AM - Aditi Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
30/1/24, 9:09 AM - +265 888 03 87 59: Very interesting ma'am
30/1/24, 9:14 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
30/1/24, 9:19 AM - +265 888 03 87 59: Sure we can proceed now
30/1/24, 9:23 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 10 minutes should be enough.
30/1/24, 9:23 AM - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
30/1/24, 9:23 AM - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
30/1/24, 9:25 AM - +265 888 03 87 59: Oh okay okay let me go through them,am excited already about this
30/1/24, 9:27 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Sure!
30/1/24, 9:35 AM - +265 888 03 87 59: This is interesting,it needs more time to understand everything and upon looking at it,if the person is reading and following this,am sure they will become better person...i quote what Mr angad has said in newsletter 2 that "Not everything is simple. The best things in life demand some work". Am looking forward to read more of these
Thanks for sharing,i will read them again in the evening to grab more

6/2/24, 8:59 AM - Aditi Edoofa: You know what, this is fantastic!
6/2/24, 8:59 AM - Aditi Edoofa: So, I am going to share an extremely significant document with you. Read it thoroughly as well as with careful details. I assure you- it’s as important as it sounds. After reading it, I want you to share what you understood from it. It helps me get a sense of how you’re learning with me!
6/2/24, 8:59 AM - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
6/2/24, 9:04 AM - +265 888 03 87 59: Alright fine
6/2/24, 9:08 AM - Aditi Edoofa: After you go through this, I would appreciate it if you can briefly summarize your understanding of it.
6/2/24, 9:22 AM - +265 888 03 87 59: Alright so the task of this guide for searching companies is to look for potential companies that can collaborate with EDOOFA and are 
willing to extend their help in the overall development of all the students that enrol for the EDOOFA programme. So one must put into consideration some factors when choosing or searching for a company like the nature of the company, Scale of the company,its financial stability And the background of the founder.

There are platforms that can be used in searching them such as Google, LinkedIn, Inc4media e.t.c and each platform has its own way of searching to find what you really want or what you are searching for.
for example in LinkedIn, There is home,where you check Current activities posted, then there is About where is gives you the brief Explanation of the company's mission and then there is People,and this gives Information and profile links of the Employees of the organisation...

Google and other platforms have also their way
6/2/24, 9:25 AM - Aditi Edoofa: You know what, this is fantastic! This is the kind of comprehension needed in an Edoofian, and voila! You are already so good at it.
6/2/24, 9:25 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Okay- now here are 2 things I would like to briefly summarize –
1 –  You can use the following form to share the company details with me
*Company Details for Project 1*

Name of the company:
Website:
Name of the Contact Person:
Designation:
Linkedin ID/Whatsapp Phone Number:
Description of the company:
How did you get in touch with the contact person?
6/2/24, 9:25 AM - Aditi Edoofa: 2, and the fun part- I’m sure you read about Scholarship Credits in the document- so, here’s the opportunity for you to earn Scholarship Credits through Project 1 –

1. If you can set up a Company Call with Edoofa Managers :*$2 per call*
2. If the Company signs an MOU with Edoofa :*$20*
3. If the Company Gives internship/job opportunities to 
the students of Edoofa in the future(proposal): *$10*
6/2/24, 9:26 AM - +265 888 03 87 59: Thank you
6/2/24, 9:26 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Also, I would like to tell you that currently, *this project is on hold* due to a high volume of ongoing projects and commitments.
6/2/24, 9:27 AM - +265 888 03 87 59: Oh alright
6/2/24, 9:28 AM - Aditi Edoofa: *Now that we’ve both summarized our understanding of the project, I think we’re ready to move to the next project!* This project is quite possibly a student favorite! So, now I am going to share another audio file and we’ll follow the same process- you ensure you don’t miss anything in it and use this time to play this audio more than once, let’s get to it!
6/2/24, 9:29 AM - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
6/2/24, 9:29 AM - +265 888 03 87 59: I do not understand
Like i should give the details from the document given or i should really find the company?
6/2/24, 9:30 AM - +265 888 03 87 59: Alright
6/2/24, 9:32 AM - Aditi Edoofa: You are supposed to find a company but not now as I will let you know when we will resume with the project.
6/2/24, 9:43 AM - +265 888 03 87 59: First it says that community building refers to the process of establishing and strengthening connections,relationships and share identities among individuals with a particular group and community
The goalof community building is to foster a positive and cohesive community that promotes social interaction and participation Initiates responsibility towards achieving success

The second project is for students to do networking,and learn how to use social media to offer African students an opportunity to join EDOOFIAN education equal system And require international education that prepares them for the future.
Students will search for multiple people who what's to study and direct them to this opportunity

It also helps to have a mindset of identifying opportunities and sharing them openly to create an impact in the lives of others.
To successfuly complete this project,students are  required to reachout to african students who have recently graduated from senior secondary schools.
Students will be required to use a networking to refer students to the program and help the organisation grow. throughout the project,EDOOFA will provide guidance and support to ensure that the students ate successful in their efforts.

At the end,the student will receive scholarship credits upon fulfilling all the projects and if the other have made all the enrollment fee <This message was edited>

7/2/24, 9:03 AM - +265 888 03 87 59: This is great🔥
7/2/24, 9:03 AM - +265 888 03 87 59: Alright
7/2/24, 9:05 AM - Aditi Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
7/2/24, 9:05 AM - Aditi Edoofa: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*
  
*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME*
For eg: In your case, it will be-
*DESIRE/ADITI*
7/2/24, 9:05 AM - Aditi Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
7/2/24, 9:05 AM - Aditi Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)

Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
7/2/24, 9:05 AM - Aditi Edoofa: *ADD MENTOR:*

Make sure that before you start interacting with the participants in the group that you created for the community-building project, YOU ADD ME.

The purpose of doing this is that:
- I will be able to track your progress and guide you through learning the networking skill
- I will be able to see the concerns raised by students and we can discuss them accordingly.
- I will be able to see whether the right information has been shared with all the students

7/2/24, 9:08 AM - +265 888 03 87 59: Alright fine
7/2/24, 9:09 AM - +265 888 03 87 59: I will do that
7/2/24, 9:14 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
7/2/24, 9:14 AM - Aditi Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
7/2/24, 9:15 AM - Aditi Edoofa: I am ____________ a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in Malawi, where tuition fees range from K650,000 to K1,000,000 per year. When factoring in miscellaneous charges, such as the application fee, student welfare charges, library fees, and other deposits, the cost increases by K450,000. Additionally, the cost of living is around K800,000.

On average, parents in Malawi spend between K1,900,000 and K2,250,000 per year at a public university, and sometimes students have to wait for one or two years to secure a spot in their desired course. Speaking to seniors, I realized that I might have to compromise on my course choice at a public university or endure a long wait. As for private universities, the costs are approximately double, making tertiary education unaffordable for my parents.

I have always wanted to support my family by partially funding my education through employment while studying, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn $50-$100 per month throughout the course.

While pursuing tertiary education in India is more affordable than universities in Malawi, it's not without its challenges. I followed the 5'S, which helped me qualify for this scholarship. I urge you to go through these five pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors will ask you questions from the flyer I have attached. 

Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

12/2/24, 8:52 AM - Aditi Edoofa: When the school’s per-term fees are less than $100, we do not get a school call done by Edoofa's Program Director.
The reason behind this is that it is very much doubt that the students from this school will or will not be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education.
So in such a case, we insist that students to forms a WhatsApp where they add me, Mr. Jyotishman, Ms. Deepali, Mr. Abhinav, and the Headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact from that school. After forming the group they:
1) either ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to specifically add those prospective students who will be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education. After they add, then tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
or
2)ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to share those prospective students' contact details with you, so that you can add them and then educate them about Edoofa. After that, tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them

22/2/24, 9:00 AM - Aditi Edoofa: However, there are a few more skills that the entire EWYL team and myself believe can add immense value to your holistic growth and give you an additional opportunity to earn, while simultaneously interacting with live projects!

*So, are you excited to find out what this is?*
22/2/24, 9:00 AM - +265 888 03 87 59: Of course...share it with me
22/2/24, 9:03 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Edoofa took it upon itself to have Edoofians interact with Live and Real-time projects. This was only possible when we onboarded our future employment partners to give us access to projects for our students!
 Now, as I was mentioning, TEAM EWYL and I want you to learn the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely included research, content writing, SEO, digital marketing, creative content, influencer marketing, social media engagement, blog writing – just to name a few.

22/2/24, 9:21 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how you can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-
1. Give your best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss your EWYL sessions without informing your mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share your challenges and the things you’re good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make your mentor trust you fully
22/2/24, 9:23 AM - +265 888 03 87 59: Oh okay....but how can i make my mentor trust me fully?
22/2/24, 9:26 AM - Aditi Edoofa: To earn your mentor's trust, exhibit consistency, open communication, professionalism, accountability, active listening, proactive learning, improvement, and rapport-building. Meeting commitments, transparently discussing progress, and owning mistakes show reliability and accountability. Actively listen, seek growth opportunities, and demonstrate dedication to development. Building rapport through genuine interest strengthens trust. Through these efforts, trust in the mentorship can develop and grow.
22/2/24, 9:28 AM - +265 888 03 87 59: Alright fine

This time, it wasn't just Mr. Angad who went, but our whole admissions team, counseling team, and the program director joined in too!

Students and parents alike had the exclusive opportunity to dive deep into the exciting journey that awaits them in India. And guess what? Mr. Angad himself talked about exciting employment opportunities for everyone in India along with the EWYL plan. We also organized a special scholarship test for students who aren't part of the Edoofian community yet.
22/2/24, 12:29 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I've got some photos to share with you. Get ready for a sneak peek into the excitement and energy of the event!
