Hope you are well.

I am looking forward to your response to my above message.
21/2/24, 4:40 PM - +263 78 121 2611: The event was a great one and they should do it  more often because l gained full trust on them and l was also educated on a lot of things including the slice cone which was very interesting. I think the Edoofa program is the best and keep on doing the good work
22/2/24, 8:01 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Good Morning Happiness!
Hope you are well.

Team Edoofa experienced a whirlwind over the past three days, with activities bustling in both India and Harare for the Meet and Greet '24 event. After a brief moment to collect ourselves, we're ready to return to our original schedule and move forward in our journey.

26/2/24, 8:38 AM - +263 78 121 2611: Yes am ready
26/2/24, 8:40 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
26/2/24, 8:41 AM - Aditi Edoofa: That's fantastic to hear about your aspirations to study abroad and pursue both a bachelor's and master's degree! The EWYL program sounds like an excellent opportunity to help you achieve your goals while also reducing the financial burden. Pursuing higher education abroad can open up numerous opportunities for personal and professional growth.
26/2/24, 8:41 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
26/2/24, 8:43 AM - +263 78 121 2611: Yes indeed
26/2/24, 8:46 AM - +263 78 121 2611: Gain industry experience and bridging the gap between academic learning and real world employment
26/2/24, 8:51 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
26/2/24, 8:51 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
26/2/24, 8:51 AM - Aditi Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
26/2/24, 8:56 AM - +263 78 121 2611: Noted ✍🏽
26/2/24, 8:57 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skillset through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
26/2/24, 8:57 AM - +263 78 121 2611: Okay thank you
26/2/24, 8:58 AM - Aditi Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
26/2/24, 8:58 AM - +263 78 121 2611: Yes
26/2/24, 9:01 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 10 minutes should be enough.
26/2/24, 9:01 AM - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
26/2/24, 9:01 AM - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
26/2/24, 9:09 AM - +263 78 121 2611: This is interesting
26/2/24, 9:11 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Did you notice the _Edoofa Hall of Inspiration_? I am sure you would one day want yourself to be celebrated in this section, the entire Student community reads this newsletter and it's a great deal to be mentioned by the founder himself, isn't it?
26/2/24, 9:12 AM - +263 78 121 2611: Yes it is
26/2/24, 9:14 AM - Aditi Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound?
26/2/24, 9:15 AM - +263 78 121 2611: Perfect
26/2/24, 9:16 AM - Aditi Edoofa: I would like to ask you a few questions to understand how much from our discussion you could retain and if there is anything for us to discuss again.
26/2/24, 9:16 AM - Aditi Edoofa: So here are the questions, answer them in detail:

1. Share a small introduction of everyone on your  EWYL team.
2. What goals has your mentor set for your EWYL journey?
3. How does Mr. Angad Singh, founder of Edoofa, interact with all students?
A. Newsletter       B. Youtube

4. Explain in your own words what the Hall of Inspiration is.
26/2/24, 9:29 AM - +263 78 121 2611: 1. On my EWYL team we have Ms.Sanjana who is the head of Department and we also have MS.Davi who is the head coach
2.My mentor has set the following goals
*make sure that my academic journey is great
*ensure that am given enough opportunities to self finance my higher education in lndia
*to work towards attaining the objective that l am learning and evolving with the relevant 21st century skills to prepare me for the real world workplace and help me grow holistically
3.A
4.The Hall of inspiration it makes students who were once not able to do certain things to do them and also helps in attaining ones skills
26/2/24, 9:30 AM - Aditi Edoofa: This is fantastic!
26/2/24, 9:30 AM - +263 78 121 2611: Thank you
