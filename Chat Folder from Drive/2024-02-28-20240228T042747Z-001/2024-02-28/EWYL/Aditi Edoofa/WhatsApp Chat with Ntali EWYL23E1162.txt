Hope you are well.

Team Edoofa experienced a whirlwind over the past three days, with activities bustling in both India and Harare for the Meet and Greet '24 event. After a brief moment to collect ourselves, we're ready to return to our original schedule and move forward in our journey. 
*Our session will commence today at 8:30 AM.*
22/2/24, 8:06 AM - +260 97 9151577: good morning
22/2/24, 8:06 AM - +260 97 9151577: I'm well,and yourselves
22/2/24, 8:12 AM - Aditi Edoofa: I am well.
Thank you for asking!
22/2/24, 8:27 AM - Aditi Edoofa: So let's begin with today's session🚀
22/2/24, 8:34 AM - +260 97 9151577: yes please
22/2/24, 8:37 AM - Aditi Edoofa: So Ntali, I would like to begin this journey by knowing you beyond the Statement of Purpose. Can you share with me what are your long-term goals and how do you think this EWYL Program will help you in achieving them?
22/2/24, 8:40 AM - +260 97 9151577: in then long run I intend to start my very own business and become successful,now successfupness doesn't come easy the earn will you learn program teaches me to be work efficient and consistent in my works
22/2/24, 8:40 AM - +260 97 9151577: I would also like to get a job because I qualify with good work ethic
22/2/24, 8:42 AM - Aditi Edoofa: It's fantastic to hear about your aspirations to start your own business and achieve success in the long run. Indeed, success requires dedication and hard work, and programs like the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) initiative can be invaluable in teaching you the importance of efficiency and consistency in your work efforts.

Additionally, seeking employment with your strong work ethic is a great step towards furthering your career goals. Your commitment to excellence will undoubtedly make you a valuable asset to any organization. Keep striving towards your ambitions, and remember that perseverance and continuous learning are key to reaching your desired level of success.
22/2/24, 8:42 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
22/2/24, 8:44 AM - +260 97 9151577: thank you,and I'll keep it in mind
22/2/24, 8:44 AM - +260 97 9151577: no I do not
22/2/24, 8:48 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
22/2/24, 8:48 AM - Aditi Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
22/2/24, 8:50 AM - +260 97 9151577: okay I understand now thank you
22/2/24, 8:54 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skillset through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
22/2/24, 8:57 AM - +260 97 9151577: okay, pleasure to meet you Ms.Davi and Ms Sanjana
22/2/24, 9:00 AM - Aditi Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
22/2/24, 9:04 AM - +260 97 9151577: yes It does
22/2/24, 9:04 AM - +260 97 9151577: so ech day has two sessions
22/2/24, 9:06 AM - Aditi Edoofa: This is for the later sessions that will happen after this initial induction.
22/2/24, 9:07 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 10 minutes should be enough.

22/2/24, 9:07 AM - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
22/2/24, 9:08 AM - +260 97 9151577: okay
22/2/24, 9:10 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Did you notice the _Edoofa Hall of Inspiration_? I am sure you would one day want yourself to be celebrated in this section, the entire Student community reads this newsletter and it's a great deal to be mentioned by the founder himself, isn't it?
22/2/24, 9:19 AM - +260 97 9151577: yes it is and I truly want to be an inspiration
22/2/24, 9:23 AM - Aditi Edoofa: That's amazing!
22/2/24, 9:23 AM - Aditi Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound?
22/2/24, 9:27 AM - +260 97 9151577: sounds amazing,thank you !
22/2/24, 9:30 AM - Aditi Edoofa: We are concluding our session for today! 😊 Let's reconvene tomorrow for another session at the same time. 🕒
22/2/24, 9:30 AM - +260 97 9151577: alright, have a good day
22/2/24, 9:30 AM - +260 97 9151577: bye
22/2/24, 12:30 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I'm happy to share that our team just got back from an incredible event in Zimbabwe, and let me tell you, this time our Meet & Greet event was bigger and better! It was an amazing three-day event! 🎉

This time, it wasn't just Mr. Angad who went, but our whole admissions team, counseling team, and the program director joined in too!

Students and parents alike had the exclusive opportunity to dive deep into the exciting journey that awaits them in India. And guess what? Mr. Angad himself talked about exciting employment opportunities for everyone in India along with the EWYL plan. We also organized a special scholarship test for students who aren't part of the Edoofian community yet.
22/2/24, 12:30 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I've got some photos to share with you. Get ready for a sneak peek into the excitement and energy of the event!

Also, we're planning to bring the excitement to Zambia too! So, get ready to embark on a journey filled with endless possibilities and boundless opportunities.
