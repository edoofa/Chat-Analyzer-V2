6/1/24, 1:41 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Hello Linford

I wanted to share some exciting news with all of you. As you may have noticed, my schedule has been quite packed lately due to work commitments. The reason behind this is something truly special – our team has organized a three-day long industrial visit called *SLICE CON' 24* for our Indian Edoofians! 🚀

During this event, *we are fortunate to have the Co-founders and CEOs of prominent brands* who will be present and sharing their invaluable experiences in one-on-one sessions. Yes, you read that right – they will be there live, right in front of us! What's even more thrilling is that a few of *our students are presenting a presentation directly to these CEOs*, showcasing why Africa, your homeland, is the best market for their products. 🤝
6/1/24, 1:41 PM - Aditi Edoofa: While I am filled with excitement for this event, please note that due to my involvement in the visit on the *8th, 9th, and 10th of January*, our regular sessions won't be taking place on these days. When we connect on the 11th of January, I'll share my students' experiences and pictures with you. 📸✨
11/1/24, 4:18 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Hellooooo!!!!

I quickly just wanted to share the scoop on *Slice Con'24—it was seriously awesome!* The event was nothing short of extraordinary, providing students with a wealth of exposure and valuable insights. 🚀
Throughout the event, students actively engaged with CEOs, asking insightful questions and gaining a deeper understanding of various industries. The *AI sessions* were particularly enlightening, offering a glimpse into the cutting-edge advancements in technology and some amazing AI Tools🤖

But wait, there's more! They also played games and made some great memories. It was a total win-win—fun and educational at the same time. Here is a glimpse of how it went, looking forward to when you will also get this chance to be here and experience these amazing things🤩❤️

20/2/24, 2:17 PM - Aditi Edoofa: The past three days flew by in a whirlwind for Team Edoofa – both for those in India and those in Harare for the Meet and Greet '24. Now that we've had a chance to catch our breath, I want to extend my sincere gratitude to you for being a part of the event and contributing to its success.

Your insights from the event are highly valued, and I'm keen to hear about your experience. Would you be open to sharing your thoughts, including your interest in attending similar events in the future and any suggestions for improvement? Additionally, if you have captured any memorable moments in photos, we would greatly appreciate you sharing them.

Your perspective is crucial, and I also encourage you to discuss the event with your parents and gather their feedback.
20/2/24, 2:23 PM - +263 78 041 2990: Alright l would gladly wanna share with you  my insights
20/2/24, 2:39 PM - +263 78 041 2990: Firstly l wanna say thank you for organizing such a vibrant event and allowing us the Proud Edoofian to be part of it. Personally l learnt a lot and all of the questions l had were answered honestly. The auditorium was full with parents and students and we got the chance to interact with the Edoofa team. We learnt a lot from Mr Angad's presentation and l was motivated too. The great part of the event was when we were shown long video presentation of that Event called the Slice_Con24 where we saw the joyous faces of the Proud Edoofians in India. Their time with affluent people from different industries and how they shared their experiences there in India. After seeing that video l could see myself already in India taking part in such events. It motivated me to work hard especially when l arrive in India and most of all to make a difference and make my community proud
My suggestion is the Edoofa team should continue organizing such events for students especially so that they get clarity on whatever questions they will be having.l captured some memorable moments in pictures with Mr Angad and l even captured video presentation of Mr Angad

Hope you are well.

Thank you so much for your kind words and feedback! I'm delighted to hear that you found the event vibrant and enriching. It's fantastic that all your questions were answered honestly, and that you had the opportunity to interact with the Edoofa team.

Mr. Angad's presentation sounds like it was particularly inspiring and motivational. It's wonderful that you left feeling motivated and ready to embark on your journey to India. The Slice_Con24 video presentation sounds like it was a highlight, showcasing the experiences of Edoofians in India and giving you a glimpse into what awaits you. Your determination to work hard and make a difference is truly commendable.

I appreciate your suggestion to continue organizing such events for students, as they provide invaluable clarity and support. Capturing memorable moments with Mr. Angad and documenting the presentation are fantastic ideas – these memories will surely serve as inspiration on your journey ahead. <This message was edited>
