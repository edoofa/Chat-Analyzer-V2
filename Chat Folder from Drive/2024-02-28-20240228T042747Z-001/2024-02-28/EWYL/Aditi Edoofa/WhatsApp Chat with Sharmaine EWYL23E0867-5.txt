I quickly just wanted to share the scoop on *Slice Con'24—it was seriously awesome!* The event was nothing short of extraordinary, providing students with a wealth of exposure and valuable insights. 🚀
Throughout the event, students actively engaged with CEOs, asking insightful questions and gaining a deeper understanding of various industries. The *AI sessions* were particularly enlightening, offering a glimpse into the cutting-edge advancements in technology and some amazing AI Tools🤖

But wait, there's more! They also played games and made some great memories. It was a total win-win—fun and educational at the same time. Here is a glimpse of how it went, looking forward to when you will also get this chance to be here and experience these amazing things🤩❤️

Here is an amazing opportunity for you as *our Founder & CEO Mr. Angad, along with the admission officers and counselors (whom you have only met virtually until now) are coming to Zimbabwe for an exclusive annual meet & greet!

It's completely understandable to have initial doubts, but experiencing firsthand the authenticity and dedication of the Edoofa team can certainly change perspectives. I'm glad that seeing familiar faces from the videos helped reinforce your confidence in the program.
