I think EWYL Program is going to help me in achieving my goals by making my fees affordable as I will be helping my parents to pay my tuition fee

While we make the necessary arrangements for you and your parents at the venue, could you please let us know who along with you is attending the event?

Hope you are well.

Team Edoofa experienced a whirlwind over the past three days, with activities bustling in both India and Harare for the Meet and Greet '24 event. After a brief moment to collect ourselves, we're ready to return to our original schedule and move forward in our journey. 
*Our session will commence today at 8:30 AM.*
22/2/24, 8:28 AM - Aditi Edoofa: So let's begin with today's session🚀
22/2/24, 9:33 AM - Aditi Edoofa: @263777434282 @263787486287 @263776137874 May I know why Idyll didn't show up for today's session?
22/2/24, 6:50 PM - +263 77 613 7874: How are you doing Ms Aditi
I was out of bundle
24/2/24, 8:58 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Good Morning @263776137874 !
Hope you are well.

Okay, I understand. Thank you for letting me know.
26/2/24, 8:37 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Happy Monday!🌺
Hope you are well.

Are you ready for the session?💯
26/2/24, 8:58 AM - +263 77 613 7874: Yes I ready
26/2/24, 9:00 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
26/2/24, 9:00 AM - Aditi Edoofa: It's admirable to have such clear long-term goals! Becoming a lawyer, building a home, and supporting other students in their educational pursuits are all wonderful aspirations. The EWYL Program seems like an ideal fit for you, as it will not only make your tuition fees more manageable but also enable you to contribute to your family's financial responsibilities. Your determination and vision will undoubtedly take you far in achieving these objectives. Remember to stay focused, work hard, and never lose sight of your dreams
26/2/24, 9:00 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
26/2/24, 9:04 AM - +263 77 613 7874: I don't understand
26/2/24, 9:06 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
26/2/24, 9:06 AM - Aditi Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
26/2/24, 9:08 AM - +263 77 613 7874: That's incredible
26/2/24, 9:11 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skillset through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
26/2/24, 9:13 AM - +263 77 613 7874: Thank you so much
26/2/24, 9:16 AM - Aditi Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
26/2/24, 9:18 AM - +263 77 613 7874: Yes it is
26/2/24, 9:20 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 10 minutes should be enough.

Hope you are well.

Please excuse me as I was unable to take your session as it coincided with a team meeting. I apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused. Thank you for your understanding.
27/2/24, 9:55 AM - +263 77 613 7874: You are welcome
