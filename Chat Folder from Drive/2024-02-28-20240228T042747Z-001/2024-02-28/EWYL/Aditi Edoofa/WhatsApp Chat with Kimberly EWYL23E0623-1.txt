Your insights from the event are highly valued, and I'm keen to hear about your experience. Would you be open to sharing your thoughts, including your interest in attending similar events in the future and any suggestions for improvement?

Hope you are well.

I am looking forward to your response on my above message.
21/2/24, 11:48 AM - +263 77 634 9467: Good morning 
First and foremost l would like to thank the Edoofian team for granting us as students the opportunity of attending such an event and I do really look forward to attending other events similar to the one I attended.Honestly there are no suggestions for improvement as for me because everything was just good and up to standard..I actually got to get a clear picture of how Edoofa operates and how they are helping us as African students to acquire education and also to reach greater heights and also fulfill our dreams.It was such an honor to meet the whole board including the Founder Mr Angad Singh who shared with us his experiences through out these years and up to now and how he is so keen on making Education a part of each and every youth as he believes the youth are the most productive in society which will help Africa as a continent to prosper also just like other continents...as a result of all that was shared on that day i actually got an eye opener on how our parents can fully invest in our Education while we study in local universities but yet after attaining our degrees we will be yet unemployed so edoofa is more like a bridge giving students access to education and also access to employment which acts as an advantage as the unemployment challenge will be solved ..Through it all I actually got to develop more enthusiasm and energy as it all proved to be those characteristics that employees look into when hiring and also it helps one reach his goals ..I really did learn alot some of it I might not be able to express it but just know I am now so eager to embark on this journey and also I am really looking forward to coming to India inorder to pursue my Education inorder for me to fulfill my goals and also my parent's wishes
21/2/24, 3:10 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Thank you for your heartfelt message. It's wonderful to hear about your positive experience at the event and your enthusiasm for the opportunities that Edoofa provides. Mr. Angad Singh's vision for empowering African youth through education is truly inspiring, and it's clear that his dedication has resonated with you. The realization of how Edoofa can serve as a bridge between education and employment is indeed powerful, and it's heartening to see your eagerness to embark on this journey. We're excited to support you every step of the way as you pursue your education and work towards fulfilling your goals.

27/2/24, 1:47 PM - Aditi Edoofa: So @263781558940 can you share what you have retained till now from the EWYL Sessions so that we can resume from that point?
27/2/24, 1:49 PM - +263 78 155 8940: Honestly I thought we hadn't begun yet because we haven't done anything except you giving me a heads up for the important notices
27/2/24, 1:50 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, no worries. So let's begin.
27/2/24, 1:50 PM - Aditi Edoofa: We’re ready to begin your EWYL program now, and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects you can and will be a part of.
