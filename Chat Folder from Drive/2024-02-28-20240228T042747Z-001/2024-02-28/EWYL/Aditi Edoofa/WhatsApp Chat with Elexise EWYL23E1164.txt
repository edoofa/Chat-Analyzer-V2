Thanks for asking!
9/2/24, 1:57 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Can you now share with me what are your long-term goals for Elexise and how do you think this EWYL Program will help in achieving them?
9/2/24, 2:26 PM - +263 77 642 4175: Our long term goals are to support her with fees payment whilst she is completing her Advanced level and we would like to see her pursuing her tertiary education in one of best universities so that she will be employable.
EWYL program will help in  making her aquire more skills and also easy the burden of fees
9/2/24, 2:29 PM - Aditi Edoofa: It's wonderful to hear about your long-term goals to support her education and career aspirations. Investing in her education and providing financial assistance for her fees during her Advanced level studies is a great way to ensure she has the resources she needs to succeed. Additionally, enrolling her in the EWYL program will not only equip her with valuable skills but also alleviate some of the financial burden associated with her education. This combination of support will undoubtedly contribute to her future success and employability. Best wishes on this journey towards her tertiary education and beyond!
9/2/24, 2:31 PM - +263 77 642 4175: Thank you

9/2/24, 2:34 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Today's session concludes here. 
Please note that there are no sessions scheduled for Saturday and Sunday.

Hope you are well.

Team Edoofa experienced a whirlwind over the past three days, with activities bustling in both India and Harare for the Meet and Greet '24 event. After a brief moment to collect ourselves, we're ready to return to our original schedule and move forward in our journey. 
*Our session will commence today at 1:30 PM.*
22/2/24, 1:27 PM - Aditi Edoofa: So let's begin with today's session🚀
22/2/24, 1:33 PM - +263 77 642 4175: Ok
22/2/24, 1:36 PM - Aditi Edoofa: So we will begin from here, I hope everything is clear till this point.
22/2/24, 1:37 PM - +263 77 642 4175: Yes it is
22/2/24, 1:40 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring that *Elexise* is prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach her professional goals.
22/2/24, 1:40 PM - Aditi Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of the student’s tuition fees.
22/2/24, 1:44 PM - +263 77 642 4175: Understood
22/2/24, 1:48 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skillset through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
22/2/24, 1:54 PM - +263 77 642 4175: Noted thank you
22/2/24, 1:54 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
22/2/24, 1:56 PM - +263 77 642 4175: Yes
22/2/24, 2:10 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 10 minutes should be enough.

26/2/24, 2:09 PM - Aditi Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:

2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
