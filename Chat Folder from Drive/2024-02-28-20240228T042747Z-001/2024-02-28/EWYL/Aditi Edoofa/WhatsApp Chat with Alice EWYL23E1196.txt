1/2/24, 1:44 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Well, I can see that there are some other people who have joined the group besides you. May I learn a little about each of them? I would appreciate it if we could engage in a quick conversation and get to know each other a bit.
1/2/24, 1:44 PM - +265 989 91 19 12: Those are my parents
1/2/24, 1:45 PM - +265 989 91 19 12: @27680955880 that's my mother. She's the best mother in the world

1/2/24, 1:48 PM - +265 989 91 19 12: Thank you so much
1/2/24, 1:49 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I would like to begin this journey by knowing you beyond the _Statement of Purpose._ Can you share with me what are your long-term goals and how do you think this EWYL Program will help you in achieving them?
1/2/24, 1:51 PM - +265 989 91 19 12: I intend on opening my own NGOs all around the world,that will focus on helping the needy with shelter food and education.  I want to also focus on austic children
1/2/24, 1:53 PM - Aditi Edoofa: That's a truly admirable goal! Your vision of establishing NGOs worldwide to provide support in terms of shelter, food, and education for the less fortunate, especially focusing on autistic children, showcases a compassionate and impactful initiative. It's inspiring to see such dedication to making a positive difference in the lives of others. Best of luck on your journey to achieving these noble aspirations! 🌟
1/2/24, 1:54 PM - +265 989 91 19 12: Thank you so.much
1/2/24, 1:56 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
1/2/24, 2:03 PM - +265 989 91 19 12: What are they
1/2/24, 2:04 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
1/2/24, 2:04 PM - Aditi Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
1/2/24, 2:05 PM - +265 989 91 19 12: Okay
1/2/24, 2:05 PM - +265 989 91 19 12: This is wonderful news
1/2/24, 2:06 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skillset through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
1/2/24, 2:06 PM - +265 989 91 19 12: Nice to Meet everyone
1/2/24, 2:06 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
1/2/24, 2:07 PM - +265 989 91 19 12: Very Interesting
1/2/24, 2:08 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 10 minutes should be enough.

1/2/24, 2:23 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Did you notice the _Edoofa Hall of Inspiration_? I am sure you would one day want yourself to be celebrated in this section, the entire Student community reads this newsletter and it's a great deal to be mentioned by the founder himself, isn't it?
1/2/24, 2:23 PM - +265 989 91 19 12: It is
1/2/24, 2:24 PM - Aditi Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound?
1/2/24, 2:24 PM - +265 989 91 19 12: I really appreciate that
1/2/24, 2:25 PM - +265 989 91 19 12: It makes me happy
1/2/24, 2:26 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
1/2/24, 2:26 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I would like to ask you a few questions to understand how much from our discussion you could retain and if there is anything for us to discuss again.
1/2/24, 2:26 PM - +265 989 91 19 12: Sure!
1/2/24, 2:30 PM - Aditi Edoofa: So here are the questions, answer them in detail:

1. Share a small introduction of everyone on your  EWYL team.

1/2/24, 2:36 PM - +265 989 91 19 12: 1. My EWYL team consists of  Ms Davi ,the head coach

2. To make sure my academic journey is smooth,to ensure that I am able to have options of paying my own education fee and making sure that I'm employable and mentally ready for the real world

4. A Hall of Inspiration is typically a dedicated space or virtual platform that showcases inspiring stories, achievements, or ideas to motivate and uplift individuals. It can be physical, like a museum or exhibition, or digital, serving as an online hub for inspiration. The goal is to celebrate accomplishments and encourage others to pursue their passions.

This approach ensures that students are equipped with the necessary tools and knowledge to thrive in various industries. By focusing on emerging technologies and market trends, Edoofa aims to create well-rounded individuals who can excel in today's dynamic job market.

8/2/24, 1:56 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I will start by explaining the projects in detail. I am sharing an audio file with you. Here’s my suggestion- listen to it at least twice, you know- to make sure we don’t miss anything out, and then get back to me when you are finished with the process!

8/2/24, 2:04 PM - +265 989 91 19 12: The above audio stated the importance of creating a LinkedIn account as it gives exposure to students into the corporate world. This audio has given me this task as a project
8/2/24, 2:07 PM - Aditi Edoofa: That’s awesome, I’m confident that if you continue to pay attention to the information shared and then respond accordingly, we will make a great team. Now, here are 2 things I’d like to briefly remind you of from the Community Building Project.


1-  I’m sharing a form with you below, you can share that with the students whom you speak with and think that they truly deserve to be an Edoofian and fulfill their dreams of higher education!
8/2/24, 2:07 PM - Aditi Edoofa: *Offline Application Form*

Which course would you like to study?

Subject Combination in A Level:-
Current Class ( L6/ U6/ A Level Appeared):

I will be appearing for my A Level (Year):-

Preferred year of Admission:- 
(August 2024 or August 2025)
8/2/24, 2:07 PM - Aditi Edoofa: And #2 – Back to the exciting part- your *Scholarship Credits*. So, here’s a quick recap of what’s the opportunity for you here-
 1. For every student that enrolls in our Edoofa Program and pays the first part of the enrolment fee, you will be awarded *$20 worth of Scholarship credits*.
2. Similarly, upon completing the Admission Formalities of the university à you will be awarded *$30 worth of Scholarship credits*.
3. There is an additional opportunity to earn $5 worth of Scholarship credits by connecting with students to provide clarity to them about the Edoofa Scholarship, which the Edoofa team will share with you!
8/2/24, 2:08 PM - +265 989 91 19 12: That's really great news
8/2/24, 2:12 PM - Aditi Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
8/2/24, 2:12 PM - Aditi Edoofa: -*A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*
  
*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME*
For eg: In your case, it will be-
*ALICE/ADITI* <This message was edited>
8/2/24, 2:17 PM - +265 989 91 19 12: Alright
8/2/24, 2:25 PM - Aditi Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
8/2/24, 2:25 PM - Aditi Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)

Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
8/2/24, 2:25 PM - Aditi Edoofa: *ADD MENTOR:*

Make sure that before you start interacting with the participants in the group that you created for the community-building project, YOU ADD ME.

The purpose of doing this is that:
- I will be able to track your progress and guide you through learning the networking skill
- I will be able to see the concerns raised by students and we can discuss them accordingly.
- I will be able to see whether the right information has been shared with all the students
8/2/24, 2:36 PM - +265 989 91 19 12: I have to go to a particular school?
8/2/24, 2:36 PM - Aditi Edoofa: No. you can go to any school.
8/2/24, 2:37 PM - +265 989 91 19 12: Okay

9/2/24, 2:07 PM - +265 989 91 19 12: Noted
9/2/24, 2:09 PM - Aditi Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
9/2/24, 2:10 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I am ____________ a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in Malawi, where tuition fees range from K650,000 to K1,000,000 per year. When factoring in miscellaneous charges, such as the application fee, student welfare charges, library fees, and other deposits, the cost increases by K450,000. Additionally, the cost of living is around K800,000.

On average, parents in Malawi spend between K1,900,000 and K2,250,000 per year at a public university, and sometimes students have to wait for one or two years to secure a spot in their desired course. Speaking to seniors, I realized that I might have to compromise on my course choice at a public university or endure a long wait. As for private universities, the costs are approximately double, making tertiary education unaffordable for my parents.

I have always wanted to support my family by partially funding my education through employment while studying, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn $50-$100 per month throughout the course.

While pursuing tertiary education in India is more affordable than universities in Malawi, it's not without its challenges. I followed the 5'S, which helped me qualify for this scholarship. I urge you to go through these five pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors will ask you questions from the flyer I have attached. 

Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

This time, it wasn't just Mr. Angad who went, but our whole admissions team, counseling team, and the program director joined in too!

Students and parents alike had the exclusive opportunity to dive deep into the exciting journey that awaits them in India. And guess what? Mr. Angad himself talked about exciting employment opportunities for everyone in India along with the EWYL plan. We also organized a special scholarship test for students who aren't part of the Edoofian community yet.
22/2/24, 12:29 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I've got some photos to share with you. Get ready for a sneak peek into the excitement and energy of the event!

 Let me introduce you to the scholarship program that is providing me an opportunity to fulfill all my dreams related to higher education - EDOOFA -Education For All.
22/2/24, 1:43 PM - Aditi Edoofa: To give you an insight about Edoofa, it is a scholarship program initiated by *Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd., INDIA*. Edoofa believes quality education should be accessible to all and not just the privilege of a few. Through our scholarship program that is based on a work-study model, Edoofa solves both problems, that of *lack of affordability and of employability in higher education.* Edoofa stays with the students throughout their academic life as mentor and caretaker, right from building the application, applying to colleges, training, and making them job-ready. This is an experience that I acknowledge as being a Proud Edoofian!🎉

*Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, Edoofa has worked with 250+ Universities in India and has a community of *more than 3000 students* from different countries📍
22/2/24, 1:43 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Edoofa receives applications from _South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries_. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 2100 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just *affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven* so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains
