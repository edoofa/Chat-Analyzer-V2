6/2/24, 9:03 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Luke, I would like to begin this journey by knowing you beyond the _Statement of Purpose._ Can you share with me what are your long-term goals and how do you think this EWYL Program will help you in achieving them?
6/2/24, 9:16 AM - +263 77 944 5802: My long term goals is I want to start an organization that will be taking part in helping those people who doesn't afford lawyers to avoid social injustice
6/2/24, 9:21 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Your ambition to establish an organization dedicated to providing legal aid to those unable to afford lawyers is incredibly commendable! 🌟 It's inspiring to see your commitment to addressing social injustice and ensuring equal access to justice for all members of society. Your initiative has the potential to make a profound and positive impact on countless lives, and I'm excited to see how you'll bring this vision to fruition.
6/2/24, 9:21 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your EWYL team. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our two key objectives are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
6/2/24, 9:22 AM - +263 77 944 5802: No
6/2/24, 9:25 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
6/2/24, 9:25 AM - Aditi Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
6/2/24, 9:26 AM - +263 77 944 5802: I got it now 👍
6/2/24, 9:26 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skillset through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
6/2/24, 9:27 AM - +263 77 944 5802: Okay
6/2/24, 9:28 AM - Aditi Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
6/2/24, 9:31 AM - +263 77 944 5802: Yes it sounds interesting
6/2/24, 9:32 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Concluding our session, I want to say it's been an amazing conversation.

7/2/24, 9:20 AM - Aditi Edoofa: @263779445802 May I know why you are late for the session?
7/2/24, 9:22 AM - +263 77 944 5802: My network was a bit low
7/2/24, 9:24 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, I understand.
7/2/24, 9:24 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 10 minutes should be enough.

7/2/24, 9:35 AM - +263 77 944 5802: Sure it is
7/2/24, 9:35 AM - Aditi Edoofa: We're finishing up our session now! 😊 It's been awesome, and I can't wait for our next one! 🚀

8/2/24, 8:36 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Great!

2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound?
8/2/24, 8:36 AM - +263 77 944 5802: This sounds great
8/2/24, 8:39 AM - Aditi Edoofa: I would like to ask you a few questions to understand how much from our discussion you could retain and if there is anything for us to discuss again.

1. Share a small introduction of everyone on your  EWYL team.
2. What goals has your mentor set for your EWYL journey?
3. How does Mr. Angad Singh, founder of Edoofa, interact with all students?

8/2/24, 8:49 AM - +263 77 944 5802: My mentor set goals for me to work hard.Mr .Angad Singh, founder of Edoofa interact with all students via YouTube.4 the Hall of Inspiration is a place where all the things that inspire us are kept.  It could be a literal hall, or it could be a more abstract concept.  It's a place where we can go to find motivation and creative inspiration, whether it's through art, music, nature, or anything else that inspires us.  It's a place of imagination and endless possibilities.
8/2/24, 8:57 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Superb!

8/2/24, 9:19 AM - +263 77 944 5802: No I didn't
8/2/24, 9:22 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Okay!
8/2/24, 9:22 AM - Aditi Edoofa: We’re ready to begin your EWYL program now, and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects you can and will be a part of. Once you’ve gone through it thoroughly- we can discuss your understanding and then help you get started with the projects! Is it clear?

12/2/24, 8:37 AM - Aditi Edoofa: So, I want you to share your understanding of the document with me. I just want to ensure we don’t miss anything! So, please, go on sharing your understanding of the above document.
12/2/24, 8:44 AM - +263 77 944 5802: The document is about the relationship between socioeconomic status and academic performance.  The study found that students with a higher SES tend to have better academic performance, especially in math and science.  However, the relationship is more complicated than that, and there are many factors that can affect a student's academic performance.  For example, students with a higher SES may have better access to resources and opportunities, which can give them an advantage.  But other factors, such as motivation and attitude, can also play a role.  Overall, the relationship between SES and academic performance
12/2/24, 8:47 AM - Aditi Edoofa: This is fantastic!
12/2/24, 8:47 AM - Aditi Edoofa: I will start by explaining the projects in detail. I am sharing an audio file with you. Here’s my suggestion- listen to it at least twice, you know- to make sure we don’t miss anything out, and then get back to me when you are finished with the process!
12/2/24, 8:48 AM - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
12/2/24, 9:12 AM - +263 77 944 5802: I'm through
13/2/24, 8:58 AM - +263 77 944 5802: In the voice note, you gave students detailed instructions about a project called "Corporate Alliance."  The goal of the project is to gain an understanding of the market students plan to enter in the future, and to begin preparing for it at an early stage.  You also suggested that students use their networks, including family, friends, and social connections, to identify potential companies to work with.  It sounds like a really great project, and I'm sure the students will find it beneficial.

17/2/24, 9:22 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Good Morning, Luke!

While we were having multiple conversations with our students in the past few days for the meet & greet event, we figured that there is a slight confusion in the invitation dates. Hence, I wanted to quickly reach out and ensure that the same is not the case with you.

- As per the invitation, *you* are supposed to attend the event along with your parents on *19th of February* which is Monday.
 
- If you are recommending any of *your friends (Non Edoofians)* along with their parents to attend the event, as per their choice, the seminar is scheduled for *18th of February (8am/1pm) or 19th February(1pm)*. They should carry a physical copy of their admit cards to enter the event.
17/2/24, 9:22 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Please ensure that you are present at the venue 30 minutes earlier and are dressed appropriately.
Don't forget to carry your admit card!

Cannot wait to see you there tomorrow! Hope you're excited too! 😃🕺🏻
17/2/24, 10:35 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Just a Correction, we will see you there on Monday, *19th February 2024*.

Your insights from the event are highly valued, and I'm keen to hear about your experience. Would you be open to sharing your thoughts, including your interest in attending similar events in the future and any suggestions for improvement? Additionally, if you have captured any memorable moments in photos, we would greatly appreciate you sharing them.

21/2/24, 9:02 AM - +263 77 944 5802: The  event went so well .This event gave many of us the chance to understand Edoofa program at close quarters since people were given chances to ask questions and everything was brought to light . Honestly I was so delighted with the event and also  as as students  this was our chance to meet and greet 😊. Actually I didn't not get any chance to take the pictures because my battery was low . I'm glad that parents of the Edoofa students were also there to witness every moment and this was awesome.
21/2/24, 2:45 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Hello Luke,

Thank you for sharing your experience! I'm delighted to hear that the event went so well and that it provided you with the opportunity to understand the Edoofa program more closely. It's fantastic that there were chances to ask questions and that everything was brought to light for everyone.

It's understandable that you didn't get a chance to take pictures due to your low battery, but I'm glad to hear that you were still able to fully engage in the event. Having parents of Edoofa students present must have added to the sense of community and support.
22/2/24, 7:59 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Good Morning Luke!

It involves working with technology-driven and digital companies, and using one's network to identify potential opportunities.  I also understand that the project is designed to help students develop the necessary skills for future employability.
