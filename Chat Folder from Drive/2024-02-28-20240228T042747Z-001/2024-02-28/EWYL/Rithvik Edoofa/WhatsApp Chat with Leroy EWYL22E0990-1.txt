29/12/23, 11:35 PM - +263 71 422 2943: My pleasure ma'am. I plan to venture into business here in Zimbabwe without including higher education. Of course higher education in a prestigious country like India is of great value, though pursuing in business is heartfelt and right for me. I nolonger want the program l have chosen. All this will help in my favor and my parents' too since money is being a difficulty to them. Hence, l can lessen their burden through this plan which will also be part of my long term goals.
29/12/23, 11:36 PM - +263 71 422 2943: Sorry ma'am for the late reply,  I was not with my mother.

27/1/24, 7:53 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Good day!
I hope you're doing well.

I know from the past few days, that I could not respond but allow me to share a story very close to my heart🫰🏻

I became a part of Edoofa almost two years back with initial thoughts on how my relationship would be, will I be a good mentor, or will I be able to think like my students, and so on. With these thoughts, I began my journey. Honestly speaking, I learned a lot each day, and yes, made some mistakes but I did not know that now there is going something that I will cherish for my lifetime, our bond. In this journey so far, I have guided more than 500 students, and beyond guidance I have made sure that I can create a transformation in their lives🌟
27/1/24, 7:53 PM - Saloni Edoofa: As an individual, I always believe that the learning process is life never ends and the more you learn, the better the guidance becomes, with a heavy heart, *I've chosen to immerse myself in higher education, and as a result, I'll be taking a step back from being your mentor🥺*
*You have a special place in my heart, and I am profoundly thankful for the honor of being your mentor*. Our journey doesn't end here; it merely takes a different course. I have full confidence in your continued success.

*I want to assure you that the Mentorship team will reach out to you soon to discuss the upcoming plan and ensure a seamless transition.*
All the best🫶🏻
27/1/24, 8:13 PM - +263 71 422 2943: Sure thing ma'am the more you learn the more wisdom you will get to guide us like you said. Though, I am very grateful for the time ee have spent together. You have been a very wonderful mentor to me. One that always understand all my perspectives and try to guide me from there. I also wish you the best with your education.
27/1/24, 8:13 PM - +263 71 422 2943: My mother has only one request, l don't know if you can consider it?
Since l have spoken with the Edoofa team including you about my withdrawal from the scholarship, we have not had any assistance in regards of the refund. Now she is not sure if Edoofa still do refunds in such scenarios due to their silence so she wanted to know from you ma'am on the procedure of the refund

2/2/24, 4:37 PM - Rithvik Edoofa: Exclusive Invite to Edoofa's Mega Meet & Greet in Harare! 🌟
2/2/24, 4:37 PM - Rithvik Edoofa: Hi Leroy,

I'm Mr. Rithvik, HOD of the Department of Student Welfare at Edoofa. Exciting news – you're officially invited to our massive Meet and Greet Event in Harare this February!


As the countdown to your 🇮🇳 India journey ticks away, with just a quarter left (approximately 3 to 4 months! 😄) before you step into this new adventure, I understand that the chaos and preparations might be swirling around you. Let's navigate through this excitement together. Here is an amazing opportunity for you as our Founder & CEO Mr. Angad, along with the admission officers and counselors (whom you have only met virtually until now, exciting right?) are coming to Zimbabwe for an exclusive annual meet & greet!
2/2/24, 4:37 PM - Rithvik Edoofa: With more than 5000 people participating, an event of this magnitude has never happened in Zimbabwe before. This meet & greet is going to be truly unique that Harare has ever seen. We present to you a fantastic opportunity for you to ask questions, address your concerns/queries, fast-track your admission process, and gain clarity about your journey to India. This event is just the beginning of a magical journey, offering you a glimpse into your future brimming with opportunities that would consist of discussions on industrial academia, the scope of your chosen field of study, and following your higher education.
2/2/24, 4:38 PM - Rithvik Edoofa: I would strongly recommend bringing your parents and guardians with you to the event! In your journey of life, they are the most integral part and of course decision-makers in your entire course of education. As you are just one step away from starting your higher education, this event would provide you with an opportunity to witness the path that unfolds for you in the next three to five years here in India - an opportunity for them to actively be a part of your potential journey, gain a deeper understanding towards the entire program and witness the journey of your senior Edoofians!
2/2/24, 4:38 PM - Rithvik Edoofa: Get ready for this adventure, and I'm genuinely happy that you're going to be part of such a phenomenal event! ✨
We'd like to reserve your seats in advance. Could you please let us know how many people you'll be coming with? This will help us allocate the right slots for you.
6/2/24, 1:03 PM - Rithvik Edoofa: Greetings, Leroy and Parents
May I know if we are in touch?
6/2/24, 1:19 PM - +263 71 422 2943: Yes we ara mam but we had withdrawn from the Scholarship program and had requested from the counsellor if we would be considered to get our refund which we had  paid for the program ,but they have been  quiet for some time now.

I hope that you are doing well
8/2/24, 2:45 PM - Rithvik Edoofa: Thanks for sharing these concerns with me
May I know if you were facing any challenges?
8/2/24, 5:37 PM - +263 71 422 2943: No Sir the major problem we have been facing is not being answered in regard to our concern. It is now almost two months since Leroy have withdrawn from Edoofa Scholarship program but we haven't heard anything about our refund or at least a respond in regards to our issue.
8/2/24, 7:46 PM - Rithvik Edoofa: Please do not worry
Let me help you with this
8/2/24, 7:46 PM - Rithvik Edoofa: Can you please tell me what was the reason for withdrawal?
8/2/24, 9:44 PM - +263 71 422 2943: Okay Sir. He withdrawn after realising that he was not in for psychology or any other course for that matter at least for now. He wanted some capital to lauch his business which he believes to be the first enterprise which is going to open many doors in line with his goals.
9/2/24, 2:55 PM - Rithvik Edoofa: Greetings, Leroy and Parents
I hope that you are doing well
